Using the power of NLP to gather data about most common masking behaviours in order to extend the database of masking behaviours in female ASD patients and to help patients and doctors identify them

A recent study suggested that 80% of Autistic women remain undiagnosed at the age of 18. It can be due to two main reasons:
 They tend to “mask” their symptoms, suppressing their own behaviors and imitating others to blend in, leading to late or no diagnosis. We will further refer to it as AM - Autistic Masking. 
The anxiety and depression resulting from this long-term masking can lead to misdiagnosis, as these mental health conditions might be diagnosed instead of the underlying autism.
Our Solution - MaskMap will help identify symptoms of AM and enable both medical staff as patients to better discern between anxiety, depression symptoms and long-term effects of AM. 
MaskMap is based on recent research that implicated that LLM-based models can be better at diagnosing than human doctors.
Our approach:
We will gather textual data of AM, anxiety and depression experiences by scraping it from social media, fully anonymizing it and feeding it into a classification model:
Our goals are: 
1) to create a tool, where you can get a probability of the symptom being AM/anxiety/depression. 
2) to gather clean data from diagnosed female patients to improve the model in the future
3) create more awareness about the AM symptoms and consequences of AM
