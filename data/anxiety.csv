Chest pain skipped beats palpitations and all things that resolve around heart because I suffer mainly from cardiophobia and the fear of SCA
For me feeling like I'm going to pass out or throw up
"I feel like I'm not real, I feel like I'm walking next to myself.
Sometimes it feels there's a disconnect and I'm looking at a video game rather than the world. 
It's so scary and hard to explain."
"Disassociation from reality, dizzyness and trouble breathing, nausea, anxious shits. For me by far the scariest is the overwhelming fear that I'm going to loose my mind. Like I'm seconds away from being completely out of control and vacant from reality. It's the scariest feeling ever, it's so hard to tell myself it's just anxiety sometimes"
Instant death feeling for a few seconds.
"The scariest anxiety symptom for many is a panic attack. It's a sudden surge of fear with intense physical sensations like a racing heart, shortness of breath, and a sense of impending doom. It can feel like losing control or even dying. It's a scary experience!"
Uncontrollable feeling of nausea.
"Dizziness, tight chest and breathlessness"
"I start to feel like I will faint or the room is spinning.  That's when I have to get somewhere else, and if I'm traped, I just faint."
Mine is definitely extreme dissociation. I don’t feel real and I feel completely disconnected from everything both physically and emotionally. I also always feel like I’m going to pass out or completely lose my grip on reality.
"Fainting. Standing up, laying down, driving (the worst). Literally anywhere and I feel faint. 

I’ve fainted probably 8-10 times throughout my life, the first being when I was in like 4th grade. My friend who has witnessed two of them says it’s looks like a seizure. It’s super scary."
"For me it’s been tension or like a pressure sensation with my head. Sometimes it’s forehead, sometimes it’s sides, sometimes it’s more the top. Some days it’s not even there and even though everything points to it being anxiety and stress related it still freaks me out because my anxiety is pretty much exclusively health anxiety"
Feeling like this will never get better.
Brain zaps and heart palpitations..
"Scariest was when I had a panic attack, Huge fear, followed by a ""wait, I'm still alive"", but until then it was the concentration of 5 years of health anxiety made manifest in a single minute.

Most annoying is insomnia. Good sleep is a barrier against some of the worst effect of anxiety, yet it's the first thing that falls when you get it, and probably the last effect i will be able to win ( an improvement in living conditions allowed me to put most of my health anxiety in the past, but anxiety herself is here to stay, in a more contained form which is just enough to fuck with my sleep)."
I really feel like my hearts going to explode
"Night terrors/hallucinations. I'm used to all of the other symptoms, I've had anxiety my whole life - I'm 32. But given the nature of night terrors, there's no way to ever get used to them. You're mostly asleep when it happens, so you can't rationalize or compartmentalize. It's just pure fear, thrust upon you, in your most vulnerable state. The worst is when it happens multiple times a night, like 3-4 times. Try getting restful sleep with that shit going on. It used to be worse, thankfully it's not *as* bad as it was a few years ago. But it's still going on. If I wasn't on my edibles and Rx every night it would probably still be as bad as it was."
"Racing Heart, Chest Discomfort, Palpitations.

I swear at times I feel like I'm about to have a heart attack but I've been to the hospital many times and I'm perfectly fine."
"Chest pain. I notice I get this when I’m very sad and stressed (when my dad died and when my grandpa was in the ICU probaly about to die) 
Feeling like I can’t breathe. 

Nausea which makes me feel even more nervous and anxiious 

I was once so nervous before a surgery my heart rate was 220. nurses were scared and went to go get the anesthesiologist who asked me “do you have anxiety?” And I just answered very sheepishly…. “Yes” 
They gave me anti anxiety meds that day it went down. I’m not sure what it was. Probaly Xanax. 

Ever since I’ve been on lexapro and BARELY get symptoms. If I do I know how to solve it and it goes away."
When it gets really bad it’s like something takes over my mind and the next thing I know I’m buying a 24 pack of beer and binge drinking to get rid of the anxiety. This isn’t every day maybe twice a week. What has helped me is transferring my salary after bills are paid to a savings account which I have no access to on weekends or after 5PM.
dysphagia and feeling that i have hypoglycemia
"My anxiety convinces myself that I cannot breathe properly, my heart starts racing and I feel like I cannot get a deep breath into my lungs.  It’s horrible because rational me knows I’m breathing just fine!"
"feeling like passing out. i hate it, my whole body just gets really light and tingly, then my face just gets cold."
high heart rate
"The tremors, can't trust voice to work"
Sudden extreme hot flush
"Disassociation, numb/pain in limbs, feeling like I’m not real or that I’m not experiencing the world properly, feeling like everything is distorted, chest pains, racing heart, dizziness, rapid breathing. Anxiety SUCKS"
Dizziness
I squeeze my hands in my sleep so hard it leaves indents and sometimes cuts
"Tremors , palpitations and a feeling of detachment from myself"
Feeling like I can’t take a deep breath and that I’m suffocating
"paranoia, thinking i’m dreaming or that impending doom sense feeling. i get driving anxiety so the impending doom doesn’t help"
"Health Anxiety 

You can be out enjoying yourself with friends having the time of your life, and once you feel a slight sensation that turns your attention to your body, your mind automatically assumes there is something seriously wrong. It can be enough to strongly dampen the rest of you night, since the Anxiety is now taking the driving seat, and you're too lost in the 'what ifs?' to enjoy yourself like you did minutes earlier."
"The scariest anxiety symptom? My ability to convince myself I'm dying from any disease with no evidence.

It makes me sad. I'm better than that."
"those moments during the day where i feel trapped in a loop of replaying thoughts, memories, and emotions it just doesn’t stop sometimes and i feel stuck in it. makes me feel crazy. I think i get impulsive when that happens i try to get out of it by doing something/anything to distract myself which will be something that actually does help or something i’ll regret later, then the cycle continues.."
"At my worst I was having symptoms that were similar to ""an increase in intracranial pressure"" and the ER was worried I had meningitis so I was given a spinal tap."
"chest pain, dizziness, and tingling. has me convinced i’m gonna have a heart attack or stroke."
The scariest one I ever experienced was when I smoked too much weed one time and I’m not sure if some of you know what icy hot is or bengay but it felt like my whole body was burning up and cold at the same time. It felt like I had icy hot all over myself.  My stomach muscles tighten up and my legs were shaking uncontrollably it lasted for a couple hours and was the worst experience I have had with my anxiety.
"When my mind grasps onto the first solution it comes up with, regardless of impulsivity, to get out of a situation.

Looking back, some of the impulses I acted on are scary asf"
Head tremor.
"My chest hurts and it feels like it’s gonna burst, or that I’m going to throw up"
Forcefully but silently screaming must be scary to others
"While I could mention the symptoms I had mainly in 2019-2021, I feel like most have already mentioned ones I've had. I'll put them in spoilers, though, in case you really want to check it when you're in a better mood. It sucks, it feels like something bad is gonna happen but it's all just related to stress and anxiety. In my case, there was more to it (Hashimoto's/hypothyroidism) but I know anxiety can happen even without physical issues.

>!Initially before I was treated for anxiety, I had two months where my anxiety and panic attacks were constant (felt really weak; had constant heart palpitations). (Note that I'm also bringing up panic attacks since for me, anxiety and panic were very closely-linked. Everyone is different.) I had symptoms like a tightening stomach or tingles around my lips/ears/etc. The one that sent me to the ER was my fingers tightening up; it felt like my hands were frozen in a claw shape. This was alongside the tingling, the sense of doom (felt like something really terrible was gonna happen, even if I ""logically"" knew it was just my body freaking out), and all that junk. After the ER and a day or two to recover, I was able to go back on Lexapro and while I still had anxiety/panic, it definitely wasn't like what it was during the lead-up to the ER.!<  


I'm curious if there was another reason for asking. If it's to calm yourself knowing whatever symptoms you have are anxiety/panic-related, it's understandable. I was the same way awhile ago. I know being either in a subreddit like this and/or talking to people you feel comfortable with helps a lot; ESPECIALLY if they also had dealt with the same stuff you're going through.  


I'm assuming you're seeing a doctor or specialist/therapist about this? I'm just asking since your anxiety will be helped knowing things have been checked."
"Well atm, I'm having this tightness and feeling like there's a knot in my throat and chest that squeezes real bad at times and makes me feel like I'm gonna pass out. It's everything I can do to not freak out and go to the ER again for them to say there's nothing wrong, again. 

Also, just generally I feel like my anxiety is getting much worse. I get panic attacks just from exercising now which sucks because exercise helped me before. Every little pain or injury makes me think I'm going to die. I ""sundown"" at night where I get a panic attack because I'm pretty sure at this point it's just dark outside my brain doesn't like it. 

Tests say I'm fine, doc says I'm fine, but it feels very real to me and it's driving me nuts."
The fear beyond fear.
"Hand tremors, My hands shake to the point that several people have accused me of being an alcoholic. I'm not. They shake uncontrollably even if I've had zero alcohol. It's gotten so bad I've had to pull over because I couldn't drive.  
Then there's the usual nausea, chest pain, and an overwhelming feeling of exhaustion."
I have an anxiety induced syncope condition :(
DEREALIZATION!!!!! It’s the absolute worst when you suddenly don’t feel real and everything around you feels fake. When you are just casually washing your hands and you look down and your hands don’t feel real and it sends you into a full blown derealization attack for hours
Having GERD and anxiety makes me a wreck. Sometimes it feels like my throat is closing on me even though its most likely the GERD. On top of that the feeling of struggling to get air or the feeling of restlessness and the crazy thoughts like im going to die any second. Truly debilitating and I wish it would stop because I feel like i cant live the life i want to live.
Derealization. Basically an overwhelming feel of dread. You don’t remember who you are. Where you are. What you are. Nothing is real.
When reality literally doesn’t feel real anymore in the worst way possible. It drives me insane. It feels like I’m in a nightmare but it’s real life and it’s hard to function when you think everything is fake and you can’t come to reality
Bad chest pain.
"Getting a visible red face and sweating just looking disturbed while watching ppl get second hand embarrassment or feel pity so then they leave you alone or treat you like a fragile baby. Some ppl will get off on it and make it worse by pointing out how red you are or try to bring more attention on to you in front of others. This happened to me at my lowest moments during anxious high stress times and as an anxious teen. For me, I would take nausea (which I had every day), feeling lightbheaded or having stomach aches over getting flushed"
"Derealization and it’s not even remotely close. It’s the reason I’m on anxiety medication, and it’s the reason for which I was actually mildly agoraphobic for a long long time! Used to be unable to go to school, to uni, to social events. Now on lexapro and it has changed my life completely. It’d been trial and error up until March this year with dosages but 15mg and ever since I haven’t looked back. I no longer take beta blockers or Valium to survive the day, and I’m now going to events with 80,000 people and packed stadiums without any trouble. Do I still have anticipatory anxiety that I might have a derealization episode? Hell yes. Does that stop me from going? Not anymore. It’s genuinely a horrible feeling not thinking you’re real, but if I have one piece of advice is give yourself a mantra to repeat when you feel anxiety oncoming. I only developed this strategy recently, in fact stumbled upon it. I was reading Infinite Jest (fantastic book that everyone should read!) and one of the protagonists was a former drug addict. He was now clean, and working at a halfway house when he got shot, taken to hospital and was STRONGLY encouraged by the doctors to take morphine. However, he resisted because he didn’t want to break sobriety. He was in the worst pain imaginable. Hallucinating, completely going insane. But he kept repeating to himself “abide”, insofar as nothing is insufferable for a second. A single second, even a minute. Don’t think to the seconds ahead, just work through getting through and endure the seconds one by one. Any time I have anxiety or feel it coming on I remind myself that this feeling is not intolerable for a second, and often my anxiety has ramped up in the past when I think about “will it always be like this”. 
Sorry this is a mammoth comment but hope it finds you well!!! Good luck with everything, I hope if you take anything out of this it’s that your anxiety won’t last forever. You can deal with another second, even another minute. Hang in there 😊"
Tetany when I can’t get my breathing under control :(
I’d say a sense of impending doom and/or that the anxiety will never go away. I had anxiety for the first 4 hours I was awake this morning and it’s passed now and I’m relieved and tired- yawning like crazy lol
Constant state of panic
"the absolute scariest 3 are the very real chest pains, the numbness/pain in my arms, and the heart palpitations"
"I’ve had bad anxiety for nearly 15 years . Tingly head is awful , This happens when I get bad news or feeing stressed.

Lately it’s all heart related , I can’t feel my heartbeat anymore and its all I can think about . I’ve had ultra sounds , ECG , Bloods u name it and its all came back ok . 

Now …I get pain between my shoulders really bad and it goes down my arms (I have very large boobs ) and i know I slump over all the time but there’s this constant fear it’s my heart and i honestly could sit and cry all day it worries me so much ."
"Right now I’m feeling really shit nausea and I can’t tell if it’s anxiety or genuine throw up nausea.

I also get very very bad stomach aches before big performances at school for music and it ruins everything, as I get stuck on the toilet with runny number 2s"
Usually anything chest related and the dreaded palpitations when they happen. Recently dizziness has been a thing that I've become hyper focused on. Fun times!
It's difficult to explain/describe but my balance goes and it's like a sudden jolt or shudder where i feel a split second pull. Like the floor is moving from underneath me and i have to try grab onto something if I can. It really gives me a fright and my anxiety immediately gets way worse. I'm not sure if it is anxiety related or partially related. It's gotten really bad lately and the fear of it happening stops me from doing a lot of stuff (on top of other anxiety issues)
"feeling like i can‘t breathe, heart palpilations, skipped hearbeats and that hollow feeling in the chest"
"Derealization, because it makes me really scared to lose my mind"
Scariest is probably the feeling of reality itself becoming increasingly distorted. I start to feel like everyone around me is going to assault me when walking down the street.
"Every time I feel a sharp pain in my leg I am immediately scared I popped a blood vessel there and / or it’s thrombosis and I am about to die. And chest pains of course as well.

Interestingly enough, when I exercise hard in the gym and my heart rate goes to 150 or above, I have 0 anxiety. Probably the serotonin is making me feel glorious then."
"For me when I have a panic attack my face and head go fully numb like static when your arm falls asleep and then my arms and legs follow suit, thennn I start to hyperventilate and my eyes start to freak out looking at everything around me and I start to idk feel my heartbeat more intensely."
"Feeling stuck, like when I’m having an anxiety attack and it won’t go away, and I start to feel trapped. No way of escaping the way I’m feeling. I’ve moved past the nausea and heart palpitations. Those are normal for me. But I cannot shake that feeling of being trapped."
"I get tunnel vision. Does that happen to anyone else too? I have never heard anyone mention it.

My peripheral vision gets blackish or blurry. I find it hard to look at other things. My eyes just lock onto some object and it takes a lot of effort to stop it. 

Looking at a single object is something i do when i am thinking hard about something or concentrating deeply. Maybe it is a me thing? Idk"
"Chest pain, heart palpitations and difficulty breathing. It’s so hard to tell yourself it’s just anxiety and you’re not dying. I suffered from panic disorder for many years and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone"
"unable to swallow, dizziness, nausea, bad fatigue, and feeling like nothing is real"
"When my anxiety is at peak I throw up and I can't swallow anything, not even my own saliva. I keep spitting. Hate it when that happens."
I spiral.
"either the tremors, the heart palpitations (while already having an irregular heartbeat), or the intense stomach/digestive pain because I also have ibs"
Freezing up. It's terrifying because I suddenly shut down which causes me more anxiety and paranoia.
"The feeling of impending doom. It’s the worst feeling I’ve ever felt in my life. I fear the nausea, hyperventilating and fainting but the doom has me feeling like this is the very end. Most of my anxiety now is about being afraid of that fear"
my anxiety attacks. i always know when theyre coming which just makes it worse because i know that if i dont calm down or figure out a way to stop it it’ll end in a breakdown which makes me even more anxious
Feeling like I’m going to faint in public places
heart racing or palpitations
"Tingling, twitching, waves of hot and cold, spiraling, feeling of dread, cardiophobia.  I fucking hate this.

I've been on 20mg Prozac for about 18 months and it worked great, but stopped last week suddenly.  Doctor increased dose to 40mg so we'll see.  I hate this feeling."
"When I was a teenager my scariest symptom was getting gassy, I literally had a phobia of farting in front of people and so it always became a viscious cycle! Now that I'm an adult my new scariest anxiety symptom is when panic badly flares my chronic pain and akathisia up. Ironically, the pain and akathisia was caused by an antidepressant that was supposed to help me get over the first fear...✌"
"when i go through days or weeks of intense daily anxiety, i can feel the effects for weeks or months after. i just feel so out of body along with head pressure. during said bouts of anxiety i lose my appetite nearly completely, lose weight, and it just feels like i'm trying to survive in general. as well as chest pain, brain zaps, muscle tension, and nausea from not eating. on top of this it's just nonstop panic that keeps building nearly 24/7, i can literally feel it in my body. that's prob one of the scariest things. i also have some gi issues that were induced by my anxiety. it sucks, especially since i have really bad health anxiety/OCD. meditation does help tho, ofc it will vary from person to person."
"Chest pain and squeezing, heart pounding, high blood pressure. I wish it just stayed in my head. I'd be fine."
"I think death is a creation to life às a relief to all this anxiety. I too no longer fear death. I bet it's very peaceful and eternal. 

If it's not and we do come back I want to return as a bird.  Likely an albatross, maybe a bird of prey, or even a gull. I want to fly, I want to soar effortless and go anywhere I want. No work either..."
Honestly ... shitting my guts out 💀 heart palpitations and shortness of breath are scary too
The feeling of fainting
"I haven't had this in years, but I used to experience the room as being much brighter than it really was, to the point where it seemed like a hallucination. I learned that this is just a physiological effect, but the first time it happened I thought I had lost my mind"
I tense up and start shaking 🫨
I get dizzy and I feel like I am about to faint.Lucky I am use to it so I know what to do but it can be scary at times.
Probably wanting to die
Sudden cold sweats and I freeze pretty much in place. Happens so much when I am working ( I am an events photographer ) and I have to jump out of it and go cool down in the bathrooms and fix my mind up.
A mix of Anger - Tight breathing - Feeling of throwing up - Panic Attacks...
Shortness of breath which then turns into an asthma attack
"Panic attacks, and self destructive thoughts."
"Chest pains, heart racing, heart palpitations, trouble breathing and tension. My heart was fully checked and it's fine, but wow... it feels like it is not."
"for me i can usually convince myself the physical symptoms are due to my anxiety, but i don’t know if i’ll ever be able to convince myself of my own sanity. and my lack of sense of self causes me the most anxiety :/"
"I'm not sure about scariest, but some of my least favorites are the following:

Heart palpitations
Cold sweats
Shallow breathing
Jaws sore from constant teeth grinding
Skin layers missing from cheeks (from chewing them off)
Sore fingertips from picking and chewing nails

GAD is a bitch."
It’s not really a physical symptom but I just feel really dreadful and stuck. Like I’m going to feel like this for forever if that makes sense. Kind of an impending sense of doom
Dizziness and shortness of breath
Somehow i developed this thing where i breathe like an idiot. I got ticks and i clench my muscles so hard i feel like i also clench my chest/ lungs. Its really scary for me. Then its the feeling of numbness or heaviness.
Shaking and heart beating like crazy. Overflooding with adrenalin. A feeling that I'm gonna die or going to ruin something for myself and others. Intrusive thoughts running rampart.
Throat tightening and it feels like you can’t breath…..hate it alot 😒
Skipped beat palpitations
Intrusive thoughts that led to panic
The room started spinning once when I was having a lot of anxiety. That was probably one of the worst symptoms I ever had.
"Racing heart, body feels weird, feeling on back of head of head, weird derealization feelings, chills, nausea body parts feeling numb or sometimes feeling dizzy like I’ll pass out (never have) but it’s a huge fear or feeling like I’m actually about to die. The body is weird I’ve found that getting myself to a comforting spot listening to music and pulling myself out of my own mind asking myself why this is happening or squeezing ice cubes really help."
"Feeling like I'm about to pass out, vision starts spinning, suddenly can't swallow, heart racing, feeling like something bad just happened/will happen. All those combined."
Weird pains in random places
Tingling face and tight jaw muscles
"Palpitations for sure, I get super scared that I’m going to faint or something"
i get paranoid delusions and derealization
"Heart rate that doesn’t go down. 130bpm+. Which makes me feel oil of breath, dizzy and light headed."
"My thoughts just get so wild and out of control I feel
Like I have to do what I’m thinking to make it better"
Over saturation of oxygen in my brain 🧠
Severe need to use a nearest bathroom...
Dizziness and nausea
Feeling like I’m going to lose my mind during a panic attack
"It literally feels like my peripheral vision closes in and grows dark, I switch onto autopilot and everything is crashing in at once, feels like drowning mentally. It’s manageable, but I had an anxiety attack whilst driving once and tried to overtake a vehicle turning off the road.

I no longer drive when I’m anxious."
"Feeling dizzy like I am going to faint, blurred vision, and breathing issues"
Definitely the lightheadedness. It feels like I am floating or am going to pass out.
"As a young man it was unwanted pregnancy 

Of course"
When my extremities go completely numb
The throat closing sensation is the absolute worst for me
"Elevated heart rate

And the hand tingling thing when having a panic attack.


The scariest was my first full on panic attack. I thought I was having a heart attack and was locked in the toilet, paralysed on the floor as my muscles tightened and my chest felt... weird. Terrifying."
"when i’m having a panic attack it’s so hard for me to not somaticize some other event like a stroke, heart attack, or yesterday i was convinced my teeth were falling out but it was just bc i was clenching my jaw and a panic attack was brewing. so i guess just the fear of dying? whatever it is.. it sucks"
"When the heart slows down so much, it feels like it will fully stop if you don't focus really hard on it to beat, or if you focus too hard, it will still stop. 

Someone else mentioned nightmares and night terrors. Those can be so bad that you wake up, see something terrible, and your only instinct is to get away. So your night of sleep is ruined because you're terrified on the floor of another room until you're fully awake."
Dry heaving and feeling trapped like everything is closing in on me & sounds are so loud
nausea since i’m extremely emetaphobic
"Feeling like my head is overheating, pressure n pain in head, and of course chest tightness and the feeling of impending doom"
I just have to clear my breath
"For me I feel really spaced out. The best way I can describe it is my brain feels like it’s wrapped in bubble wrap and it feels like it’s going at a slower rate than everything else. 

When it’s bad it’s to the point where I can’t do anything except sit there and zone out.

Most of the time I become aware to the point where I focus too much on things like moving my eyes or blinking, then I become too aware and I just get into a very panicky loop. 

It’s a very weird feeling. It’s that followed by the headaches that make my head feel tight and I can never figure out why I’ve got said headache until after the headache finishes (usually after a good day or two)"
Anaphylaxis. It’s awful. Takes at least 5 minutes to talk myself down from thinking I’ll actually suffocate. At first I thought I had asthma because it was so bad.
"When your heartbeat does a big *thud* and now you’re trying to make it to the bathroom with vertigo. 

The worst thing I can imagine is passing out and then shitting myself."
"Worrying about a hernia all the time because I have chronic groin pain.  Hence, I've been to the ER a lot.  😩 Have 2 or 3 cats that require meds and feeding on the floor AM and PM.  Worry if I won't be able to take care of them.  Gives me chronic stress"
Idk if its anxiety but i constantly feel slightly too hot but i’m not actually hot because the feeling stays even when i’m cold. Really uncomfortable to have all the time
Breathing...throat tightness
I forget how to breathe and feel like I’ll just drop dead at any second. Also my arms go numb
"Tremors, spasms and ticks. Basically, not being able to control my body and not knowing when it's going to end, or if its going to end at all. What if I, maybe this one time, I have these ticks forever and have to live with them constantly. Scary af"
The first time I ever freaked out bc my heart I was 13 and I'm 37 and I've had those problems for my whole life and my chest hurt so bad I went to the hospital recently.  I'm thinking about getting back on xanax bc life's not worth living for me without them.  (I been off em for years too)
Chest pains. Heart palpitations- feels like it’s about to beat out of my chest. Breathlessness
"Tight chest, IBS and suicidal thoughts"
Unstoppable shaking and waking up every 5 mins whrn trying to sleep. Sleep deprivation is ultimate cause and aftermath of bad anxiety :(
"Not as bad as the others, my throat closes up so I struggle to say anything"
"The heart has been the one for me lately. Starts pounding, or feels like it’s not beating. 

Before that it was the symptoms of passing out or just dying in general regardless of everything being fine."
Extremely high heart rate
"Fuzzy vision, chest pain, numb feet (this usually comes with the crazy adrenaline rush that starts at the beginning of my really bad panic attacks, so its a little more rare), and derealization. God I hate the derealization."
"The intense sweating, the hand shaking, and he shortness of breath. I feel like I'm about to throw up, and the room won't sit still. One of the worst feelings of my life"
dissociation and feeling like i'm moving when i'm not and like i'm going crazy
Not really “scary” but i feel like i could crap myself
"My heart would stop and then add an extra beat or just add a beat , my throat  would feel like it was closeing up even tho its not, i would breath heavy, and i would feel like im dying :D"
My eyes start to water
Being in public at night and alone and you have fainting spells from a severe attack I feel like are a whole can of worms in itself.
"Oh man, look at my past posts. If it’s chronic. It is horrible."
"Been almost 20yrs since I got out of the army and started having panic attacks but every single one I think I’m dying. My brain knows I’m not, but the inner voice keeps saying maybe this is an actual heart attack this time. It’s regoddamndiculous."
Sometimes when I am walking my legs will lock up and I cant move them. I will try to talk myself and when I am able to walk they feel like jelly.
Intrusive thoughts that are horrific
"Not being able to breathe & chest pain- it feels like your lungs are failing 🙄

Once I realized it’s just anxiety, I actually started being able to control feeling like I couldn’t breathe, it was the not knowing if it’s actual breathing problems or just my brain."
When I feel like ima pass out or throw up and theirs no one I know around to help me
"a mental shock state. My body shuts down, and I end up falling because I feel extremely heavy. I’m still conscious, my hands and face get numb. Its a state where I’m out of touch with reality, and it’s hard to break out of. I feel like I can’t move, and I get sick."
"Had a panic attack in a waiting room so bad that my body seized up and I was completely physically incapacitated. My fingers went in different directions, my armed felt as though they were bent backwards and I couldn’t not form a sentence to ask for help. Worst."
not being able to breath or heart beating wayyy to fast
I hyperventilate and pass out .
"Heart and breathing variables always scared me the most. Had my first panic attack in my late teens. Diagnosed with panic disorder. I'm 54 now and am just starting to get a natural handle on it.

Always could feel my heart. Beating fast? Scared me. Slow? Scared me. Felt like I wasn't getting enough oxygen. Never actually passed out, but I would get tingles and numbness in my extremities and back of neck. Meds helped. Not much else seemed to. Alcohol REALLY helped until I realized I was an alcoholic and stopped drinking 11 years ago. I went to Dr about the skipping a beat sensation. Diagnosed with premature ventricular contractions. Was having those most of my life. Told they were harmless. Didn't help as they always scared me. I was on anti depressants off and on. Couldn't figure out a discernable pattern. Seemed random.

After years of having the panic attacks mostly under control without meds (by no effort on my part, just seemed like part of a cycle) in March of 2021 I got covid with hardly any symptoms. It passed but a month later I was fighting Long Covid. I'm just now feeling 90-95 percent. After many freaky physical symptoms seemed to be on the wane, psychological issues started, along with my old friend, panic disorder. Diagnosed with PTSD, went to therapy, started low dose lexapro. 

I was so desperate for relief, both mental and physical, I started trying things that had actually scared me in the past. Mediating and conscious breathing exercises had ironically always made me anxious. 

I started mindful meditation 12 minutes a day. Many free apps available. Very easy to do and doesn't take much time. This led me to explore breathwork. I had actually been introduced to this while in treatment for alcoholism and had very good experiences with it, but never used it again after treatment. I read Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art by James Nestor. It clicked for me then. I googled holistic breathwork and watched YouTube videos. Read everything I could on it. Started using apps to try different breathing techniques. I've now settled on a routine that works for me. I'm thinking about getting certified and teaching breathwork.

My resting heart rate was always around 100. Now I average 73. I've noticed how my breathing affects my heart rate and so many other physiological processes. The thing I was most afraid of, namely, screwing up my breathing was actually the thing I NEEDED to get a handle on. Through breathing I can control my racing mind and heart. I am so sad I ignored advice I heard time and time again. If I had started these practices earlier, I think my life would have been VERY different.

It's no cure. I'm still on lexapro. I still get anxious. But man is my life better when I use these tools. Practice doesn't make perfect. It makes things better than they were, so I keep it up.

I wasn't expecting to write all of this but all of a sudden I felt moved to, lol. 

I really hope thus helps someone who is struggling."
"Horrible palpitations, adrenaline overload, panic attacks, impending doom, chest pain, depersonalisation, derealization, feeling like im going crazy, vibrations, hyperaware of everything in my body, always on edge, ectopic beats, air hunger, lightheadiness"
"It hasn't happened to me except for a few times throughout my 28 years, but my entire body goes numb briefly, vision goes dark/purple, and it becomes hard to stand. It's only happened like 2 times I can remember."
i hate the chest pains the most. they make you feel like you're gasping for air most of the time
Dissociation without being able to control it right before a panic attack. I can't prevent it when it happens and I usually can't get a good breath in so I feel like I'm suffocating. My chest hurts a lot after and my energy is completely drained. It's terrifying
"I hope this is anxiety lmao but tingly hands, face, and arms"
The dread
For me it’s the lightheadedness and overheating. I always fear I’ll pass out.
"Some of mine are a bit … psychosis-like. I think it’s likely related to also having autism as I’ve been tested for many disorders and all psychotic ones were not present. 

- Sometimes I get this weird pins and needles sensation that starts on my buttocks and creeps into my lower back slowly, that indicates a panic attack is brewing. 

- Sharp chest pain around sternum that also  radiates down my left arm (heart is very healthy, I’ve had it checked many times).

- Feeling like reality is literally slipping away in front of my eyes (sort of feels like I’m floating away whilst watching a move in VR, but that movie is real life?) - I believe this is called depersonalisation. The worst I ever had it was when I thought for a brief 5 minutes that I was literally dead and had to cling on to my Dad’s leg to stop me floating away forever. 

- A horrible ominous feeling that something very bad will happen - usually on a global level.

- Auditory hallucinations - this is most likely related to my autistic auditory problems. They’re mundane sounds like my dog barking or someone calling my name and let me know I’m subconsciously anxious (they distress me only when frequent) 
BUT 
when I hear the baby crying in the room next to mine (there are no children living at or near my place) I KNOW the anxiety is severe and it makes me way more anxious."
"It's the morning symptoms for me.

What do I mean?

Recently,  I've noticed that I wake into an instant state of anxiety. Like right at the point that I wake. And I need to get on my phone and distract myself before I get out of bed until it disappears. Or it throws my whole morning/day off"
"The inability to catch my breath when I'm not even moving around. I also dealt with extreme night anxiety where I had an irrational fear I won't mention the particulars. Had to go on 150mg zoloft and 15mg buspirone 2x a day. It's been almost a year of zoloft, buspirone for only 2 months. But these meds have helped tremendously. I cant believe I went 36 years without them."
"Chest pains, then muscle spasms. But I've grown used to them now."
"The struggle to swallow and being nauseas because I’ve always had a fear of vomiting. And Intense Hand and body shakes while in motion. Usually when I’m operating a moving vehicle is when I hate the shakes the most because I can’t control them when I am driving, so it just puts my anxiety into even more further overdrive."
"Depends on the situation. Generally it’s cluster migraines in my temples which are terrifying. 

If I’m flying I forget how to swallow and need to move around. Which if you’re trapped in a tube at 30,000+ ft is the worst place to be for that lol"
"muscle twitching, muscle cramping, hypnic jerks even outside of falling asleep, brain zaps, icepick headaches, heart palpitations, sharp abdominal pain, shakiness, lightheadedness, complete loss of appetite. doesn’t help that i have health anxiety"
"Everything feels wrong, not I feel wrong or bad... Everything feels wrong.

The [Spider-Sense scene](https://youtu.be/Gi3ynBNjNJU?si=1s2-6bFiqExZMypA) in No Way Home is the best visual I've ever seen of this feeling.

What makes it scary is that, you don't know why, just everything is wrong and anything could be a threat."
"I stop breathing without realizing it, it’s only when I start to feel dizzy I force myself to breathe again. Also loosing feelings in hands, up the arms, feet and legs."
"Heart pounding, shaking voice, blurred vision, feel like I’ll pass out. It’s sucks."
Constant feeling that ima pass out and feel pressure in my head
Disassociation with time moving super slowly.
"Not feeling real or like my surroundings are. Happened in class a few times, huge amount of panic, hearing and seeing in slow motion (or surroundings spinning fast), heart palpitations, dizziness and fear you’ll go crazy"
"In my opinion, the disassociating. I've been anxious and dissociated for around 50 minutes to an hour."
"Chest pain, an intense dread feeling, panic and disassociation."
The feeling of doom and inability to relax until the anxiety unravels
"Heavy weight in chest, can't breathe, sweaty palms, frantic thoughts, feeling hot, headache, if bad, faint.

I can managed it now but it happens daily still but fainting has lessen."
For me it's ear ringing. When I get anxious my ears start to ring and it becomes louder and louder until I can't hear anything else besides my heart beat it feels like a horror movie😭
Feeling like I’m choking trying to swallow.   Nausea in the middle of the night.  Sleepless nights. Darkness and silence makes me panic. I’m 48 and live in fear.
Blood pressure: 210/110
"Mine is when I get so upset I vomit. Mostly only happens before work. Even worse when I can't sleep, or didn't sleep well. I hate throwing up and have always been a little fearful of it, so I think that's why it's so scary for me. But, the scariest over all is the fact I know I'll always function with this. 😏 Exhausting."
"Light headedness, passing out."
I’ve literally fainted from anxiety/panic attacks which is so scary I feel off for the next few days
"Anything to do with my chest and the feeling like you can’t  breathe bc one day I will be having a heart attack and be like “oh it’s just my anxiety, let me do breathing exercis-“ and drop dead before I finish the sentenxe"
Dissociation where I feel like I'm going to pass out. I used to feel it every day at work and I'm so glad I haven't felt it in a hot minute
"heart palpitations. i hate having those.

and feeling like im choking (?) like... my throat tightens up or feels like its tightening that i feel like i cant breathe properly or talk.

and, my hands going cold, or feet. thats another one.

but i hate heart palpitations more. it feels AWFUL. it scares the shit out of me sometimes. 

and to FEEL it, in my most anxious/nervous state? heck no. makes me feel even more worse."
I get tunnel vision and think I’m going blind. I then spiral and my heart beats extremely fast and makes me feel like I’m going to pass out. It’s so scary but reading each and every one of these responses makes me feel not alone and strangely feel a little better about my anxiety.
"I feel like it always changes and it’s awful, sometimes it’s heart palpitations and that happens for months then it goes away then it’s frequent urination, muscle pain, right now it’s throat tightness I hate it so much :("
Instant shits.
Extreme tunnel vision mixed with loss of depth perception.
"Pins and needles sensation in my limbs, hyperventilation, loss of appetite or feeling like I'm gonna throw up also the feeling that there's smth in my throat choking me to death. It's awful."
Raised heat rate.   There are times I can't take it that I just rather die.
"DP/DR, by a country mile. I wouldn't wish those symptoms on any soul in the universe."
My vision blacks out
Recently it has been lips/tongue tingling and going numb and full body numbness which is because I've been hyperventilating without realizing it!
"For me it’s got to be shortness of breath, but the kind of shortness of breath where your brain goes “oh shit I can’t breathe” and then it just gets worse cause now you can’t stop thinking about how you can’t breathe. It’s a terrible self perpetuating cycle"
Heart palpitations that are so intense that it literally feels like a big fish flopping in my chest
Random heart rate spikes that make me hyper aware of my own heart beating in my chest only for me to get lightheaded immediately after.... Not fun... One time it got so bad I almost passed out at work.....
I get so anxious I feel like I'm in a tiny room with a bunch of the worst serial killers EVER wanting to fillet me! I don't feel like I'm in my own body.
Heartburn and heavy chest that eventually makes breathing very difficult
Intrusive thoughts.
Numbness to body. Feeling like I just floated out of my self
"I had intense palpitations for like 1 1/2-2 weeks straight. My mom has SVT and her dad had heart attacks so naturally I was scared, freaked out so much I went to the urgent care. Doctor just told me it’s due to stress and will go away. 
I had so much anxiety I gave myself heart issues, which gave me anxiety.

My chest still hurts when I’m anxious for too long but the palpitations did go away.

Edit: dunno how I didn’t think to include dissociation. Definitely way scarier."
"Nausea/loss of appetite, dizziness, increased heart rate… it’s all scary to me because I have emetophobia and usually if I’m having a panic attack they’re all paired together. Sometimes I get really shaky. 

If I’m having a panic attack or getting super anxious I will start to feel convinced I’ll throw up even if that’s not the case. I’ll begin to feel trapped and claustrophobic, unless I go outside. A big fear of mine is getting sick around other people."
"Stuttering, fear of lashing out others or saying dumb shit"
"When my arms, legs, face tingle and twitch really bar and lose feeling i cant move my body. That’s only in extreme anxiety attacks. My typical anxiety attacks give me bad headaches."
Heart palpitations really scares me
"When I have panic attacks, I already know I'm gonna have some REM-related parasomnia when I sleep. I used to have the same sleep paralysis demon hovering above me, screaming into my ears and making me feel suffocated. I learned that the screaming is a disorder in itself called Exploding Head Syndrome 🫠 75% of sleep paralysis episodes involve hallucinations, and the scariest part for me was having out-of-body sensations...cause tell me why I'm on the other side of the room watching myself sleep??"
"The nervoussystem lighting up. It's like having bulbs of energy surging through your nervoussystem, and it ""burns"", not in a painful way, it's just unpleasant.

One second it's the chest, then it's the back, then it's an arm, or it's just a light burn across the entire board. And it responds to external stimuli. It's like spidey sense, but it's very ""mr obvious"", about what it responds to.

Also fingers get the ""burn"", neck gets stiff."
"Either the nausea or the inability to breath.

I am so scared of throwing up.

I also have asthma. So that could literally kill me.

Either way, very scary"
I feel like I’m either on a rollercoaster or an elevator
My muscles seize up to the point I am immobile and yet having a seizure. Total loss of body control and my mind is in a prison because I can’t tell my body to stop.
"Feeling like passing out and losing control… wich followed by: shit are people seeing I am unwell, what will they think of me ?"
"Weak legs, feeling of passing out, fast heartbeat, derealization and fatigue! That horrible fatigue from all that anxiety and depression."
Constant chest pain/pressure and heart palpitations. My anxiety was really bad once where I spent a whole day completely disconnected from my body. I’d look at my hands and it didn’t feel like me.
Derealisation. Impending doom. Thinking I've got some terrible illness that's been missed by my doctor. Dizziness. Skipped heart beats. Confusion. Disorientation. Too many symptoms and they change all the time.
Pressure in my head! It feels like my brain is filled with air like a balloon that’s about to pop!
"Tenesmus, bowel movement and diarrhea"
The feeling that it will never be over and the deep sorrow that comes with it. This is it. There is no way to be happy ever again.
"Mines would be the dull chest pain and the irregular heartbeat, I get through the day. Even though I don't feel anxious but when it starts of course I would still get anxious."
"mine is a bit like I can't breathe so well. I am breathing but I think I can't get enough air in.
the other one is skipped heart beats and palpitations"
"heart rate goes through the roof and i get a huge feeling of pressure in my chest. it literally feels like the weight of the world. it feels like doomsday, like i’m preparing for everything to come to an end usually over such a minor thing."
Bathroom issues. Creates whole cycle and I hate it
"Stay away from coffee, it makes anxiety worse for us."
"I ate a HUGE dose of weed once and experienced impending feelings of doom so bad I called an ambulance and was literally crying and begging the paramedics not to let me die as they drove me to hospital. I had chest and arm pain so bad they gave me a bunch of morphine injections on the way to the hospital, and then when I got to the hospital they gave me Valium for the anxiety.

I never realised you could get such intense physical pain before from anxiety, it felt 100% like a heart attack."
Heart rate and intrusive thoughts.
"Probably chest pain, so bad that I can’t move"
"Labeled 1-7 1 being the worst
1. Feeling like I can't control my breathing during a panic attack.
2. Aches around the head area
3. Chest aches
4. Arm numbness/weakness
5. Arm pain
6. Nausea"
"Others have already listed some of the scariest sensations, but no one mentioned this one - when you actually feel the adrenaline being pumped. You know in movies when something bad happens and the camera is on the main character, but the camera moves away from them but it's also zooming in on their face? That's kinda how it feels. There's this cold feeling that spreads from your heart, then this like electricity type of feeling that travels down the arms and through the chest, then this cold terror that washes over you from head to toe."
The true worst is just everything that comes with an attack. For me I usually feel a palpitation/butterflies in my chest that just stay constantly and get worse and worse at which point I usually gasp for air and then go straight into controlled breathing. Then I'll get a little lightheaded and start feeling chest pains and arm numbness. Then afterwards I'll feel like I can have another attack at any moment and I get super tired and just want to be in a really tiny soft room with pressure on my chest. Unfortunately I don't have a tiny soft room so I usually end up wrapped in a blanket in the fetal position 😅
"My body gets really cold and I get chills, then I start to get extremely emotional and go into some pretty dark places."
"Chest pain in the centre and left hand side of chest.   
Numerous ECG's, bloods and cardio tests have come back negative, but it doesn't stop me panicking about the pain and discomfort"
"Extreme tunnel vision and nausea, had it once in a busy city and I swear I thought I was gonna die"
Chest pain and increased heart rate
Breathing feels shallow and like I’m suffocating… sometimes coughing phlegm.
"my chronic symptoms scare me the most:
• heart palpitations 
• shortness of breath
• dizziness/feeling faint 
• weird vision issues - like blurred but in a staticky type of way? .."
The chest pain and breathlessness. Strong fears of cardiopulmonary issues.
"I can't talk anymore when I have anxiety. It started in 2018 when it gave me globus hystericus. My throat doesn't work properly anymore since a severe panick attack. 

Not being able to speak up is scary because it sometimes causes me to be used as a doormat. It has messed with my mental health. The only remedy I have found is to only surround myself with very reliable people."
Dry heaving (never actually puking) - this oddly helps calm me down.  Hi heart rate but betablockers help me with that to an extent.  Insomnia.  Hand tremors in the morning right when I wake up and my mind starts racing.  Sadly I turn to drinking to calm down a lot...it works but I know it's not the best solution.
i get disoriented and idk where i am or who’s with me😭
Just that out of control feeling and feel like I need to run to the hospital
Oppression on my chest and sound hypersensitivity
I have emetophobia (fear of vomiting) so my scariest symptom is nausea. It makes me significantly more anxious.
"Waking up with a huge knot in my stomach, while breathless and racing negative thoughts all at the same time"
Tingling in parts of my body. I have a severe fear of strokes so I always assume that is what it is.
"i shake uncontrollably from my feet to my jaw, its to the point if i walk around i look like im about to lift off the ground, it causes nausea and and muscle strain the next day i feel like i was hit by a truck"
"Right now its pain it never seems to stay in just one place it moves around its focal point tends to be my chest but if I address that and make the pain go away or minimize it'll just go and materialize pain somewhere else my stomach my back, leg, arms whatever. A month or so ago I was much worse I had the pain but I was also going through some bad emotional turmoil that would send me into a panic attack multiple times a week I was almost always on edge it was terrible. Now I might only do it once a week if I'm lucky it won't happen it all."
"Depersonalisation, once I was convinced for a week I was wearing someone else’s shoes. Sounds small but it freaked me the fuck out. Also thought I had bugs crawling under my skin shortly after the shoe thing , and every time I looked in the mirror my nose got bigger. Anxiety so bad I was heading to psychosis at some point… I also couldn’t eat and the thing that got me out of the psychosis path was that I was basically starving and just slept all day.

Anxiety burn out from undiagnosed AuDHD and working as a sales person (I have limited social battery and work made me anxious as hell. Betablockers helped but after I quit I felt much better)"
feeling like im going to lose control n do or say things i dont want to say or do
"Numbness but palpitations can scare the hell out of me if I am having a major “run” of them. Last time I actually went to the ER because I thought I was dying. Even though I’ve suffered from them since my early 20s, every once in a while they can be REALLY scary"
"The fact that practically any body pain could be attributed to anxiety, and therefore trying to work out, on any given day, whether the pain is passing anxiety or actually something to be more concerned about."
tingling all over body so far since 2021 no doc can find symptoms pretty sure body stuck in figjt or flight
When I dryheave and try hard to stop myself from throwing up. It's hell. Worse if I'm in a public setting and I need to know ahead of time where exits are or the washrooms. My anxiety is that bad when I feel like I can't breathe in air. My throat gets tight. I wish I never had this but I have Complex PTSD and I was a nervous kid as well. Good fortune to all.
"Rash actions to make myself feel safe during panic attacks.

Quit your job immediately. Run (literally on your feet run) away from where you're currently at. Get rid of anything trackable like phone, debit, and credit card.

Luckily, I have been able to wait until these intense moments pass, but the emotions in the moment feel so real and ""reasonable"""
Derealization/depersonalization for sure
Feeling like I’m gonna 💩 myself every time
"I was driving when I had the first one.. Kept on driving.. Then I stopped the feeling by ignoring it... Still to this day, if I feel like I am about to have one, I do the same and control my breathing and it goes away."
"anxiety hits me from time to time, example im traveling somewhere, seeing trees, beaches and natures and thinking this would be a relaxation, but its an other way around, the more you think or do some relaxation, it induce my anxiety symptoms, its a trick to our brain that if you do relaxation meaning its an other way around (you panic) because your brain think you scared af"
Vision loss.
For me feeling like my throat is closing up
heart palpitations and dizziness that makes my surroundings dark
"Airway tightens up, things around me begin to fade out, heart palpitations and impending doom."
Food apetite and then feeling even worse after not eating
Shortness of breath💀💔
Same
Breathlessness
"I lost the ability to find words and talk. I wanted to talk but i just didnt know what the words were. 
I thought it would be forever. But it returned after 2 weeks. Its just not as good as it was"
"Weak legs, fatigue"
"The most recent is I'll be having a panic attack (nausea, hot and cold flashes, feeling of passing out,feeling of impending doom) but my heart rate stays in the low 60's! Scaring me to death! Most of the time my heart rate jumps up into the 90s or 100s, but the last couple had no elevated heart rate. It's starting to make me worry even more."
"Well, panic attacks are by far the worst anxiety-related thing I’ve ever experienced. But if we’re talking just general physical anxiety symptoms, then all of the chest and heart sensations. Chest pains, palpitations, high heart rate, etc. It doesn’t help that I have Cardiophobia and am paranoid about just suddenly dropping dead from SCA. I have no risk factors at all, and have had a normal EKG and bloodwork, and I’m only 16. So I literally have no reason to fear this at all. It’s just this freaking anxiety. 🥲"
Same. And breathing issues.
Same. Heart pounding out of my chest on a daily basis. Difficulty exercising :(
same dudeee
have you ever heard of the heart hold? it really helps me and i have similar symptoms!!
This is mine too
Same
Same 😢
i experienced the same and had to go to urgent care bc i genuinely thought i was having a heart attack
So cardiophobia can cause palpitations like the PVC/skipped beats?  I had 2 of those today (while also fearing for my heart)
[deleted]
"Honestly the crazy heartbeats, and the anxiety of the fact your heart is beating fast, makes it even worse"
"Yeah skipped beats are a bitch, but I found the less you care for them the less they happen"
sometimes i thinkni stop breathing shallow breathing
Yep I feel that way too.It is scary in the moment definitely.
"Can you tell more about throwing up (nausea), because it makes me so anxious that i feel like if i throw up i might die, does anyone else experience this?"
Agree
"This for me, too, esp since I have a history of fainting (then half the time when I came to I would barf). So I get anxious which makes me feel faint which makes me more anxious and it's just an awful cycle. 😖"
"Omg, the feeling of throwing up can suck it!! My evenings have been riddled with it recently."
That's disassociation
"Relatable. I don’t feel literally like I’m walking next to myself, but I feel like I have no control at all. Like my consciousness is heavily distorted. Really scary."
"Yup, dissociation is terrifying to me and causes spikes in anxiety. I've learned to sit with the feeling and convince myself that it's really harmless and only gets worse when I'm anxious"
I know that feeling. And its scary af
"you are not alone, the feeling you've just described, i'm going through it now... even medications isn't doing a thing, i have to accept who am i and move on..."
Yep derealisation it’s one of my worst anxiety symptoms. That’s when I know my anxiety is really bad.
"The other day I was at a party and didn't know anyone, I thought I was okay but the anxiety hit me hard and the feelings of dissociation and disconnect and everything started to feel not real. It was so alarming . 
I have feelings of heaviness like my body feels like a weight and I'm walking through thick mud. 
I'm also not on any medication because my doctor doesn't take me serious and I understand that there's a great misuse of these certain meds but I think I'm one of the people that actually need them."
This is exactly how I feel everyday  . I don’t understand how this symptoms could be so common
Same. :(
I deeply relate
The doom is terrifying
"Yes I had it so bad that I took myself to the hospital. I was not able to drive so I walked to a taxi stop but none came. While waiting I thought I was gonna scream, or faint. I had to drive anyway and then in ER they gave me a calming drug and advised me to seek therapy. I'm doing much better now."
I feel you bro 😭😭😭 I’m having it regularly even worse
"Same, and after I faint I feel so embarrassed because it usually causes a scene. Then people don’t believe that it’s a panic attack and want me to go to the hospital. 

I have found that if I blurt out that I’m about to have a panic attack and may faint, I never faint, which is then embarrassing because I look like a weirdo."
I have the exact same feelings. Does the dissociation come and go or is it always there to some degree?
"I'm going through fear of fainting while driving.  My anxiety goes through the roof when driving because of this fear, which makes me lightheaded (hyperventilation) which increases the fear that I'll faint even more.  It's a nightmare."
"Hey I've had this for ten years, feel so much less alone hearing comments like this. We should have our own group of people who are scared of fainting or faint!"
"I, too, experience the weird tension in my head, particularly around the crown area of my head. Swiftly followed by extreme dizziness which only ever occurs in periods of heightened anxiety. Health anxiety is a bloody pain in the arse."
Had this today for the first time suffering with anxiety for years. Did yours feel like an all over throbbing but no pain?
For me its in my temples and its only when im anxious. Scares the shit out of me everytime. Have bad health anxiety as well
"I get this a lot and ever since one of my close friends died very young and suddenly from an aneurysm that’s exactly where my mind goes, especially in the middle of the night……"
"Hypnagogic hallucinations. I have them since I was a kid. :( Sorry you have to go through that! Sometimes I’m afraid that I will get scared so much that I’m going to die from heart attack, my heart is beating so fast when I open my eyes during REM and see things around. It’s horrible."
"There was a point for me a couple years ago were my symptoms really ramped up and i went to urgent care 3 times in 2 months. Each time they did all the tests to see if i was having a heart attack, each time they said my heart looked healthy, for some reason my brain wont accept it and its frustrating"
So the SSRIs helped with the chest pain? Is it easier not to fear the pain as much when you're on them?
This like everytime I go out I feel like am about to have hypoglycemia and start to panic 🥲
I clench my jaw in my sleep and always have a sore and tight jaw
"It's frustrating when people downplay the word ""convince"" here. They don't understand how convinced we become that we 100% are dying. Like I have trouble making long term plans because I'm convinced I won't here here in three months."
"This same exact thing happened to me, never touched weed again."
Do you think it could be Acid Reflux or GERD mixed with anxiety? I have the same exact symptoms as you and I was diagnosed with Gerd 2 years ago and GERD amd anxiety love playing of each other. Not a doctor just sounds super similar to what I am going through!
OMG YES. I feel like I've swallowed a golf ball somedays from gerd and it's such a massive trigger for my anxiety.
Yeah I woke up earlier today and was immediately being thrown into an attack. Not a nice way to start the day
Same
Same pal.
Where do you get the tremors and spasms the most?
"Do you get them in your legs too? Even when you’re not “anxious”. I have GAD, so I’m always subconsciously anxious about something, even when I’m not actually feeling “anxious” I’m anxious, if that makes sense…"
"Increased BP, dizziness, ears ringing"
Amd breathing issues that trigger anxiety.
"Same, idk if it's just my anxiety but my heart rate rarely settles down. It's exhausting"
Try yin yoga it really helped me
I am working toward acceptance of that and death itself because I am so tired not living my life as I used to. It may take forever but I am on those baby steps
What’s that ?
Do they prevent cardiac arrest ? Or heart attack? I am in SSRI and benzos momentally
"As soon as anxiety hit for me, it goes right to my stomach and it starts churning and then I get light headed/breathe less and feel a lot of nausea like I would throw up or pass out at any moment. I'm not necessarily scared I'm going to throw up I just don't want to so that gives me more anxiety"
IF you do throw up don't fight it. Will make it worse. Many feel afraid they will choke or pass out/die if they vomit. The body is designed to have you throw up safely as long as your body position is correct. Just let it happen...get it over with. Breathe calmly.
Sometimes i feel like i had amnesia. I kinda forget who i am and where i am. I don't feel outside of my body but the world around me feels not real or crumbling or something. Is that disassociation too? Or is it something else?
*dissociation
"I do this and try to chug water and do breathing exercises. It’s so hard to explain the feeling I get when it happens, but what everyone is saying here is spot on."
Same
Great to hear that you are better now. Keep going!
Mine started off as occasional episodes but the last few months have been chronic
"It’s a vicious cycle. The more you sit there and think about it the worse the anxiety gets. A lot of the time I just pull over and *hopefully* wait for the feeling to pass but sometimes I genuinely feel like I’m not going to be able to pull over in time and I’m going to crash. 

I just had a month straight where I couldn’t drive myself anywhere. Luckily my mom was able to take me to and from work but idk it’s just the worst feeling :( I’m so sorry you deal with it too"
"I relate to this so much! Have you tried slowing the car down a lot so that you know you'd be able to stop at any point, and just seeing if the fear and the symptoms decrease? If they do, it's a sign for you that it's anxiety and not a real physical problem that will actually make you faint"
"I definitely feel less alone too! I never realized fainting was a pretty common symptom for people with anxiety. I feel like I always sound crazy when I try to describe it to people, they just don’t understand."
"I’ve not really had the dizziness thankfully. The tension feeling definitely gets worse the more anxious I get though. And yeah, health anxiety sucks. Feels like a never ending cycle. I have a psychiatry appointment Friday and hoping to get on some medicine that can start to hopefully get me back on the right track."
Can’t say I’ve noticed throbbing but can say there’s no pain involved.
"Sometimes it’s my temples. Funny thing is most of the days since it first started that it hasn’t happened were weekend days, which I guess makes sense because I’m waking up more relaxed most of the time on the weekends."
I totally get that… makes me thankful the feeling I get doesn’t start til after I’ve been awake for at least a slight bit.
"Thank you, yes, it's awful - my heart pounds so hard and the bed will feel like it's shaking, I'm assuming because I'm shaking. I'm sorry you've had them for so long too :("
u/theerealobs exactly the same
Yeah… it was all anxiety
"Big problem for me too, grinds my teeth down"
"You can 100% be prepared for an anxiety attack but when that adrenaline hits, your brain isn't yours anymore. The fear chemicals are just doing their job well, and when you don't have anything tangible to run from, your brain is just going to pick something.

Some people don't understand how hard it is to override your very biology. It's not a conscious choice. The only solutions are coping mechanisms and therapy to try and figure out why your brain is doing this... and unfortunately, that's like throwing darts with a blindfold on. It takes a lot of misses before you start to find what you're looking for. But eventually, you can start to hone in. Anyone can solve their anxiety, it just takes time, practice, and hard work."
Ya that's what the doctors told me but when it's bad it's hard to remember that it's not anything dangerous lol
"Its so sick how they play of one another. Always after I eat a meal too, ill get the tight chest and then the throat tightness usually comes in right after. Sometimes ill skip my lunch break at work just to avoid having that feeling the rest of my shift."
"Mostly and usually in my right side of the body. Neck would twitch to the right side, my right arm would twitch, my right leg is the most common to have ticks too, like if I'm completely 'calm and relaxed' in bed about to sleep, but still anxious, I'll literally just kick-twitch with my right leg. I've also noticed that the muscles on my right between my ribs started to twitch for some reason."
"get what in my legs, the muscle twitching? if so, yes i get them everywhere all over my entire body, it’s worse when i haven’t had much water but there’s always a muscle twitching somewhere"
What is your usual hr?
"you put your right hand on your chest above your heart and push down a little, that’s where the “trauma” nerve is and it lets your body know that you’re safe. i think there’s a video on youtube of an example :)"
I've never actually thrown up before but have gotten close. Especially if I'm driving too.
Thanks

Do you ever get like a weird feeling in ur head that's not like a headache but its unexplainable 
Thank you! It was way past my bedtime when I wrote the comment and apparently it shows
"It seems the more we resist it and worry about it, the more it occurs. I'm sorry you're also going through this, reading through this thread it seems quite prolific as an anxiety symptom. Just wish I could find a therapist who understands it"
Sometimes I can only drive on roads. The freeway is a massive trigger. Very challenging when I live 100 miles from work.
"It really sucks. Are you feeling any relief at all now? I still have pretty bad anxiety, but at least now I can tell myself its just the anxiety rearing its ugly head, even if im still freaking out. Hope you find some relief, friend."
100 ish? Honestly it's not too bad considering I'm pretty young
Great.
"I get all of this. Like the worst feeling in my diaphragm- like someone is about to make me jump from a cliff, and I don’t want to. My ears start ringing, my head starts tingling, I feel like I want to pass out to get away from being so scared of what I’m going through, but I’m also too scared to pass out. I wrote about this on another post - but, hugging someone who is calm has helped me TREMENDOUSLY. I’ve hugged my dad for 10 minutes at a time - felt so much relief it’s made me cry. But, within 5 minutes my heart starts to race again and I go back into anxiety hell. So I go back for another hug. My last episode lasted 2 hours - my insides vibrate after attacks like those, sometimes for a week or more - and I’m mentally and physically exhausted. If I can catch it in time, sometimes doing a slow jog outside or around my house to catch my body up to my heart can work - but, sometimes it’s just so bad there’s nothing to make it calm down. 

This forum has helped me so much in trying to figure out and deal with these symptoms!! Would love to know if anyone else feels this way."
Thanks for commenting. I don't feel alone anymore haha
"I see a lot of people spelling it wrong, so no worries but I like your response with thank you instead of being offended. So I thank you for that! 😌"
I don’t work that far away but I relate to that so much. I haven’t driven on the highway in probably 3 years now because it’s just too much for me. I don’t want to be going that fast if I ever crash and it doesn’t have any roads to quickly turn on to if I need to pull over.  It’s like living in hell :/ my own curated hell at least lol
"Thats very kind, the chest pain is still present on an almost daily basis. Most of the time I still find it hard to believe it is related to anxiety; but I cant keep running to A&E every week."
That’s your resting hr like just sitting on the couch
"Yeah, it is the scariest one for me too. I was talking to my therapist about it last week. It does make me feel like I am on the verge of losing my mind forever."
Of course! Learning from mistakes instead of being offended is much more rewarding
"Yep, it slows when I'm feeling calm but sometimes it's just like that for no reason just resting"
"Try several things all which have research papers for verification.  DHA+Uridine, make sure you eat eggs for choline but do not over supplement choline or depression can ensue.    
Then the gut microbiome should be refreshed, try some TUDCA, also a probiotic PS128 L. Plantarum, that specific strain PS128.   
make sure you are getting enough magnesium in your diet. Magnesium glycinate once in a while can help, every day may not be well tolerated.  Although topical magnesium can help a lot too, like dead sea magnesium etc."
"Same, one time I was so hungover it was 120 while sleeping I thought I was going to die, needless to say, I don’t drink like that anymore. Only 28 and ever since a horrible panic attack from a red bull I’ve been struggling to just be me again."
"I had the exact same thing, and I was 28 at the time. Cutting back drinking definitely helps reduce anxiety (alcohol and caffeine), but at first if you drink a lot normally, you will probably have a lot of anxiety from dropping drinking (ironically)."
"Did you ever recover ? I sometimes feel great and sometimes feel off, I’ve come to realize maybe I’ve always felt that way now I’m just hyper aware of it since that episode last year. I find my self checking my hr while in bed and other things I never used to do."
"I wouldn't say I recovered fully to where I was before I started heavily drinking, as I started and continued heavily drinking on and off since I was 19.

What I can say is that when I stopped drinking after that one excruciating yet memorable situation at 28, I stopped for at least a few weeks. When I did drink, I made sure to never combine alcohol and caffeine. In addition, I only drank beer or wine. It took a year or so (most likely because I still continued binge drinking a few times a month if not more) to feel like my anxiety was vastly better, but then I ended up unfortunately slipping in and out of the habit.

The only time I can remember feeling truly ""recovered"" was probably a couple of years later when I would take a month or two every year and fully cut out alcohol for that time. In those months, it was the closest (if not fully, It's hard for me to say for sure) for me to feel that I was fully free of any extreme anxiety. I am and always have been an anxious person, so I cannot say my anxiety completely disappeared."
"Steven Wright put it best:

“You know when you're sitting on a chair and you lean back so you're just on two legs and you lean too far so you almost fall over but at the last second you catch yourself? I feel like that all the time...”"
"It feels like when you are playing a video game and you hear boss music, but never see the boss."
A tightening of the chest and throat. Sometimes accompanied by tunnel vision and selective hearing that I can't control.
My brain relentlessly attacking me.
A combination of self-doubt and feeling like everyone else is feeling that way about you too
"A lot of times my body is anxious before my mind catches up. Increased heart rate, frantic breathing, and sometimes a headache and some random muscle aches."
I have to poop
"Every thought is tainted with pessimism. Everything is going to be worst case scenario, if it isn't already. My insides feel tight like I've got a weight on my chest. Butterflies in my stomach, except they're not good. They're bad."
"Paralysis and regret. You know you should do something, but you're too scared of making the wrong decisions. You want to take action but your body resists. Your thoughts become tangled around one another. You stop thinking about the decision and just about how bad each choice will get.

It's never anything life or death, either. It's about what to do at work, when you should do laundry, what kind of health insurance will work out for you, when to go to the store to avoid the rush. What could be an A or B choice becomes a series of infinite mental doors, each leading to a situation more miserable and implausible than the last.

So you put it off as long as you can. Until it actually IS a problem. Then you have something to actually worry about. It's a never-ending cycle of self-fulfilling prophecies that makes people hate you, see you as unreliable and possibly malicious."
Like I’m about to die by my heart exploding and throwing up my gust. I get so shaky and nauseous if it’s a bad one
"Like nausea, or emptiness, or staring at nothing. It's the worst feeling but the most comfortable at the same time. It's being really sweaty one moment but ice cold the next. Forgetting where I am or what I'm doing. Talking about things I don't want to tell people bcuz my brain and mouth aren't connecting."
My body wanting to leave itself
Constant heart palpitations. I never really relax. Ever. Like I could be doing the most mudane thing like watching TV and I don't feel relaxed. It's like constant fight or flight. I feel tense in my shoulders. Just getting through a day is so exhausting that I'm tired All The Time.
Not wanting the future to ever come.  Thinking about the future too much.
"Have you ever almost stepped out into traffic, or looked up to swerve your car at the last minute, narrowly avoiding a serious accident?

Hold that feeling for three to four hours."
"Often the sense that I just need to get out of there, like really desperately need to leave, but often I can't. The worst is when several anxieties clash. Then there's the OCD anxiety, which is just a whole other level."
"Like I'm getting backed into a corner, ears start buzzing. Stomach tightens up."
Suffocating
a stomachache with chills and panic racing through my veins. i also sweat like crazy which just makes me more stressed and it’s the never ending cycle of fear and sheer panic 🥰
"Like a group of people in your head are incoherently shouting at you, all telling you different things and overloading you with information

At least this is how anxiety feels to me"
"Lower self esteem, harder to do simple tasks, a small form of insomnia if it’s at night, and some other mixed emotions that I can’t really express in words."
"Healthy anxiety is like a rush of energy. You feel nervous but you also feel alert.

Unhealthy anxiety is like you body is shutting down and you don't know why. Your stomach is in pain, you can't breath. In bad cases hours pass in seconds and the world goes black, words blur together into an near incomprehensible mess, walking is impossible (thanks goodness I'm not a big dude), you can't focus on anything and you can't plan anyhting beyind your next breath. And then the ambulance staff explain that even though you think you can't breath, you've had 100% oxygen saturation for likely the past 2 hours."
"Feels like I'm constantly going to ""be in trouble"" when I've done nothing wrong and don't really have people of authority in my life who would reprimand me."
Worrying that you will mess something up or just feeling that you’re going to do bad.
"For me...the dread comes with it. Like, dying. It's hard to regain control of the moment, and that's the struggle.
Dread, dying, loss of control, fear of passing out....everything around me is moving in a different speed...
...it's better as I age, because I can try and reign it in."
Depends on how severe. Mostly it affects my stomach. I feel extremely nauseous and I feel like my insides are just filled with butterflies.
Feels like fear
"Have you ever felt claustrophobic, yeah think of that but only in your chest."
"Like watching a spring that's wound too tight and waiting for it to explode but you have no idea when that is. The spring survives for way longer than expected, but all at once, when someone slams a door or when the room gets too loud, or maybe someone decides now is the perfect time to repremand you. It SNAPS. Pieces of shrapnel fly everywhere and you try desperately to minimize damage, sometimes successfully, sometimes very much not."
"It's like this... RYAN!!! GET UP!!! YOU OVER SLEPT!!! YOU FUCKING FORGOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND YOU MISSED IT!! THERES NO COMING BACK FROM THIS, THE WORLD IS ENDING.  After 5 minutes I realize I was wrong

 Then sometimes my PTSD kicks in and that's more like... GET READY...THEYRE COMING RIGHT NOW TO KILL YOU AND YOU NEED TO FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE. THEYRE GOING TO HURT YOU IF YOU DONT STOP THEM! After 5 minutes I realize I was wrong. 

But the most pervasive is my depression. That one sounds like: ""You're a piece of shit and you deserve all the bad things that happen to you. Your friends don't like you, they just hang out because they pity you. You'll always be alone.""  
That one is the most subtle but it also takes the longest for me to realize it isn't real. Sometimes a week or two."
"I feel like my heart grew 6 times in size, I can’t breathe, if it gets bad enough I shake and feel a tinkling sensation, as if I could feel every inch of my skin."
Every outcome might be hell
Like the accelerator on a car getting stuck on the floor
[deleted]
"The back of my neck gets stiff and warm, my head feels prickly, my heart feels like it isn’t working even though it’s beating way too fast. 

Maybe some slight nausea in there too."
"Recently, it has been worrying about a job application so much that nothing else matters. Every waking moment is consumed by the anxiety of being rejected from yet another job and watching the time until homelessness tick away."
"The feeling in your heart & chest after a jumpscare...but for hours sometimes. I lose control of my mind and I struggle to breath. Uncontrollable pacing sometimes, unable to make my mouth & mind connect. My anxiety has gotten so much better over the years but at my rock bottom I truly believed suicide was my only escape. I didn't want to die but I didn't want to live in fear anymore either. When you hear ""it gets better"" I can promise you...it really does. Hold on tight!!"
"I have a dream that describes it pretty well. In this dream I'm at the top of a very tall, very unstable structure. I do my best to stay balanced to keep it from falling but no matter what it falls. I can't stop it and I have nothing to hold onto so I fall too. I get that feeling in the pit of my stomach when you fall and then I have no choice but to accept that I'm going to die. And then I wake up... that's pretty much a panic attack."
"A heart attack, suffocation"
"A tightening pain in the chest, lump in throat, trembling inside, racing thoughts that reenforce the sensation of fear"
[deleted]
"like a hot, humid tightening of the chest"
Cold and bottomless
"I’ve had migraines since I was 7. Back then, throwing up was the only thing to make the migraine go away. Now an adult, when I get anxiety I start coughing to the point to make feel nausea and I keep trying to throw up, guess my brain still thinks that throwing up will make my pain go away. Just thinking about this is giving me anxiety :/"
"When it’s bad, it’s like a staticky, nauseating buzz in the back of my head. I think through an inner monologue/dialogue, so this makes it hard to think, which gets me behind at work, which increases my anxiety, which makes it harder to think. I’ll get intrusive thoughts and the worse my anxiety is, the more of a physical response I’ll have - muscle spasms, repetitive phrases, just something to get these pointless, useless jolts of energy? adrenaline? out."
Like I’m always walking a tight rope
Claustrophobia.
My heart beats really fast and I can't catch my breath.
Drowning
Mentally it feels like you go to the wrong website and your pop up blocker isn't working and suddenly there are 5000 ads and you don't know how to close them. Physically it feels like someone sucked all the air out of my lungs and someone is sitting on my chest. The room spins and the walls are closing in. Super fun.
"Nausea, tightness and a very uncomfortable feeling in my chest, my mind racing uncontrollably in a negative way. It's enough to keep me up all night at times. Excess caffeine amplifies it something fierce. Cannabis cranks it up so high that I rarely do it and my tolerance is super low now. And I do it far less than I used to for that reason."
Thousands of mosquitoes in my brain
"I always describe mine in two ways or two types as I call them. The hyper focus on one thing going through every way it could go how, how I could try to make to work out. I work myself up (may have a panic attack) and then normally have a explosion of emotions at the end and over react to minor issue or thing I can't control. 
The other is a sense of fight or flight, my body can not relax, my chest is tight, my muscles  are tight. But my brain is not actively worrying or focused on anything that could make me feel this way."
"When it's bad, I basically hyperventilate for a bit, then sit there shaking for hours with nothing but dread about the fact that I'm non-functional racing through my head. If I had to miss work or something with friends or family bc of it, it's like 10 fold."
"Like a cold, wet hand pulling everything out of your guts."
It's a dark cloud that's always there. The sun comes out once in a while but that fucking dark cloud is always on the horizon.
That noone likes me or gives a shit. I'm getting better but just sometimes it's hard to believe
"When you lean a 4 leg chair to 2 and you were to about to fall?

That millisecond of fear?

with Anxiety its that feeling.... NONE STOP"
Action daggers and mind lightning.
"Like something terrible is certainly about to happen, despite any amount of evidence to the contrary."
It feels like a certainty that the worst will always come to pass which is only heightened by the fact that it has on quite a few occasions or has at least come very close.
Like my surroundings begin spinning around me and I disassociate like a mf until all I can do is think nothing is real at all and my existence is a lie
"Like being nauseous, or feeling a small, but consistent pressure in my fingertips. Or, when it gets really bad, an inability to think clearly or breath normally, while still trying to analyze every single movement, every single twitch, of everyone around me until it gets better"
Like giving up
"Something is wrong but you cannot tell what.

Kinda like that one spidey sense scene from NWH."
Like I died and I’m in hell. And I’m not religious but I often tell my partner I feel like I’m in hell. It’s constant torture. You don’t trust yourself or anything else. You’re like a frightened animal.
Suffocating. There's no escape. You don't know where to go. The mind is completely clouded. there is a lot of despair. You think that hopes die. You fear moving forward. Fear quadruples. You want to cry from impotence. You want to stop the pain and you don't know how. Nothing that can be done or said. You think it's the end.
"Thanks for replying. I am medically diagnosed with a couple anxiety disorders. My therapist gave me an assignment to describe how my anxiety feels like this week and I was having a hard time finding the right words. I really appreciate you all for finding some of them for me. God, I love the internet."
A weird stomachache
My stomach hurts and it feels like nothing is going right. Like I even delude myself to thinking I'm deluding myself for thr things that are going right. If that makes sense.
Trying to move with shackles and chains holding me down.
"I feel like a lot of people claim to ""have anxiety"" when in fact they are just experiencing anxieties that we all do. There's a fine line between having anxiety and just have some anxieties. I'm not an anxious person, I don't have anxiety but like literally everyone, some things bring out anxiousness. 

That being said, for me, it's always at play in supermarkets or pubs/restaurants and I guess it's a feeling of paranoia. That everyone's watching me or judging or passing comment as I go by and just waiting for me to make an awkward mistake, so they can laugh at me. I simultaneously want to run away and snap or attack. Like a rapid tug of war between fight or flight."
"It feels like in a horror movie, when the killer is in the house and the music is playing the slow build up to  a jump scare"
"My doctor calls it rumination. For me it’s an endless doubting voice in the back of my mind. “Your coworkers tone of voice had changed, are they mad at me? Let’s over analyze everything you’ve done for the last 3 days. Maybe you made a mistake. Better apologize. Wait what if that makes them more mad. Queue apologizing and coworker has a dafaq face lol. This was my life near endlessly till about 2 years ago I found a good doctor to work with and started taking Sertraline (generic Zoloft), it’s completely changed my life. No more rumination."
"A black hole opens in your stomach, kinda feels to me like waiting to go into the principals office as a kid but you don’t know what you did to get in trouble. I frequently ask myself why I’m so scared and what I did wrong to feel like I’m in trouble but can’t ever give myself a good answer."
Like a normal day.
Dread. Darkness. In danger
"Constant fear, restlessness, negative thoughts. Being fired, becoming unemployed, being fined by the tax authorities, my loved ones dying, ""my friends probably don't even like me"", embarrassing moments from the past, even the distant past constantly haunting me with all the emotions attached, guilt and shame. Fear of the future, thinking about when I get cancer and how I will die. Thinking my loved ones don't love me back and how they will betray me. Walking in the street and imagining strangers attacking me. And that's when I'm in therapy and on medication. And that's for my whole life, I guess. I'm still functional, I go to work and do my job while this is in my head. Constantly monitoring it and reality-checking it and keeping it at bay. I wonder what I have done to deserve this. I wonder who I would be without it."
"Sometimes it's like there's a vine inside my body that's constricting my chest that refuses to let go no matter what I do.

Other times it's like a switch being flicked that makes me run on autopilot, and then as it leaves, it takes my soul with it, leaving me robotic.

It varies on the situation."
Makes me want to run out of my body if that makes sense
"It's like a vacuum and a big pressure at the same time in my chest.

I lose all assertiveness and I just pace back and forth arguing against myself. Between rationalizing why I should not do something, and the part that knows that doing it will actually make me feel good. And also about how ot will let down people around me.

I could waste one hour or two during these episodes.

When the rationalization side wins, and I reach the point of not return (aka, being late) for ""not doing"" what I planned, say visiting a friend, seeing my gf, going out, etc. I just get overwhelmed by a feeling of guilt and shame.

All in all I mostly manage to deal with this social anxiety, and to be a functioning member of society, but yeah... my life is fun..."
"A sick feeling in my stomach, hyperventilating. It feels like you're falling in a dream, you know you won't hit the ground and die, but sometimes you wish you could to escape the thing thats causing anxiety. Feels like you're drowning but you don't pass out. I mean some people do but-"
Dissociation. Out of body. Increased heart rate
"A fairly persistent sense of dissociation that I can only mask by keeping myself busy, which is usually hard because I lack motivation. I also have a looming feeling of dread that soon I will die or something bad will inevitably happen to me or someone that I love.  You're not alone friends, this disease makes me feel so alone like I'm the only one that feels this way no matter how many people make me aware that I'm not alone."
"I can’t be comfortable or relax no matter what I do, it’s just a constant state of tension."
Like I'm playing 4-D chess with the entire universe and see no possibility of a positive outcome.
"Regular daily anxiety. Knots in my stomach and my brain constantly thinking and plotting out a million different scenarios, never quiet. And it translates to my mouth running a mile a second. Since my brain is constantly running, it takes me to overthink and hyper-analyze everything to a point that people always have ulterior motives or out to get me.

Panic attacks…stomach flu symptoms with my heart pounding and shallow breathing like I just ran a marathon or trouble gasping for breathe.


So glad for Paxil and therapy…have quieted my mind and allowed me to have a life again!"
"I have visions of spinning gigantic plates on top of huge spires, on top of rocky mountains. Each spinning plate represents a different area of my life (work, a relationship, laundry etc).I have to keep the plate spinning. But I am becoming smaller and smaller, and they are towering over me. The mountains they balance on are crumbling, and I am running from one to the other to the other trying to keep them all up in the air at once.

Sometimes I also feel like a humongous  black dog (a mythologically large great dane perhaps) is sitting on my chest and it's hard to breathe. All the time. To the point of paralysis.

Anxiety also makes me need to pee a lot. And I sweat really hard and it makes me feel awful. (I don't usually sweat much). I get nauseous if it's really bad. And my throat blocks up so I can't speak. Everybody obviously hates me and the poisonous feelings slowly seep in.

&#x200B;

Wooo anxiety."
"For me the best I have come to explaining it is this.most of the time Bee?

heightened anxiety: BEES!!

Panic attack: SWARM RUN!!!!!!

So anxious my brain wont let me talk: HORNETS AND BEES!!!!!!!"
"Where you wake up feeling good. Like you can take on the world. Everything is bright and beautiful. You can feel your calm breathing, it’s filling your lungs. 

Then. Then something says- what if. What if you breathe one more time and you die?
What if you walk one more step and something catastrophic happens.
Now the colours fade. Now your energy has gone. Now your breathing is no longer calm.
So you make a decision. Do you risk the impending doom or do you lay back down Ans close your eyes and try again in a hour. In 2 hours. In 5 hours.
And you just hope when you open your eyes you see colour and your heartbeat isn’t racing and you can breathe again."
It's sudden bursts of tears for no reason and no warning signs. It's panic attacks in the middle of the night where you wake up suddenly in full flight or fight mode and start racing around the apartment like a mad person unsure if what happened or what to do.
aaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAaaaaaaaaAaAaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaAaAaAaAaAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAaAaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaargh
"Ever seen a loved one talk to someone, then they both look at you, then look back and say something then laugh/chuckle?"
"Imagine you are in an empty room with just enough space for you, the room is completely safe but you know something is wrong about it, maybe the walls are too close? The tickering noise coming from the lights? Is impossible to know but  you know for sure that is not comfortable, there is something to it that tells you to run as fast and far as you can, which direction? What if Im in the wrong one? How can I tell if Im correct? Remeber you are (feel) in a closed room with no visible exits and an urge to run, you just need the feel to run even when you know there is nothing to run from, there is no enemy nor danger, but your head keeps telling you otherwise and from my experience and a professional knowledge there are no clear answer to that kind of question but I can assure you is a constant nightmare all the time, that excluding of course the panic attacks and the unbearable moments where my body just feels like Im the room itself, its just not an easy feeling to handle.

[Sorry for grammatical mistakes. All my support to everyone struggling with this shit, stay strong fellow redditors :D]"
"It's like my brain is on a treadmill and has turned the speed up too fast. 

My thoughts are too fast and can't stop - it's like a voice continuously talking and moving on to different ideas with no ability to pause and actually comprehend the words it is saying. I lose track of things very quickly unless I'm able to recognise what's happening and take myself to a quiet space to analyse it and calm down, or at least give myself some structure. 

Also it feels like everyone is watching me. Not just the real people nearby, I objectively know they probably aren't watching me. But there's a huge invisible audience watching me. They're in my head and listen to my thoughts. It makes me feel like I'm putting on an act, like that social awkwardness at a party feeling, but in my own head."
everything around me feels like a dream. it’s all soft and floaty but it also feels like i’m being smothered by a pillow
"You're watching a movie in a packed theater in the middle of the row and you gotta use the bathroom *right fucking now* and it absolutely cannot wait, but you don't wanna get up and scooch past everyone nor do you want to miss the movie, but you don't want to soil yourself either."
"Waterfall ears, this sharp, specific pain right next to my heart, I can’t catch my breath and everything is going black.

All the time."
"“Everybody’s talking about you. Everyone’s laughing at you, look around the room and put your head down, is there something wrong with your clothes, do you smell, is there something wrong with your face, this is why nobody likes you, did you say something, why are you like this.”"
"Millions of questions in my head at once. Hence, brain in overload. 

Shaking, gripping something too tightly. 

Thumping of the heart.

Vision seems...different. 

Middle of the chest hurting. So far I experienced that one time so far. 

Fidgeting. I'll play with something in my hand, like my debit card or turn my phone around in my hand. I plan on getting a fidgeting necklace from Etsy in the future to help. 

Can't make eye contact with people. 

In a room with alot of people I feel overwhelmed, and also feel that they're just finding something wrong with me or my clothes or something. 

It feels like the end of the world. For example I got upset when I didn't get my drivers license because I felt the testers thought I was stupid. I got upset when I accidentally dropped food I was attempting to grab at a Hardee's. I apologized profusely because I was thinking how they must think I'm clumsy and stupid for not grabbing the box better. 

Keeps you awake at night. You may be tired, but your brain is awake and thinking about something that happened like years ago."
"Depends on how bad that panic sets in when your on freeway and someone almost hits you head on. The near death that is extreme end where you end up having panic attacks. 

The low end is kind of like falling in a dream where pit of stomach goes up in throat. After military this is about where I live my life. If conditions are perfect and I am distracted watching show game something like that. Is about only time it goes away. 

The death scare is on spot super stressful focus is on me stuff. After military that type of stuff puts me towards that end. If I am just blending in background doing my thing I can be towards low end. 

For every 2-3 minutes spent at high end it takes about 30-60 minutes to get back to normal assuming a good environment. If stressful shits still going on it wont go back down."
Feeling like my life could end at any second and repeating this same bullshit every fucking day.
"The overwhelming sensation of impending doom, the inability to live life and the sensation of never being enough therefore being a failure in every aspect in your life."
Feels like I’m keeping a secret and should that secret be found out everything will be over
I faint or vomit
"A heart attack. 

I have a panic attack disorder through my PTSD, that has gotten better over the years. When it first started I would get 2-4 panic attacks a day.. each lasting about 1-2 hours. I literally could not work because of it.

They felt like heart attacks. That, or like I was drowning and everyone was watching me but no one would save me. 

Have you ever seen a kid suction cup a drinking cup to their lips, or suck up a capri sun until the container was just a crinkled little piece of plastic??

That’s how they feel too… like I am the cup or the capri sun… someone is sucking up my air, suffocation."
"Not knowing what to do or what is happening, you feel stiff, you look at your hands to feel that you are here, but you don't."
Mental torture.
"Mixture of effects really. Knobby knees and shaky legs, sweat, a boner, a wierd smile on my face, the need to take a shit, and a racing heart."
"Its pain up your spine that latches onto the back of your head.


Constantly trying to push harmful thoughts into the front of your conscious. You want to voice your concern but it shuts off your voice box and covers your mouth.


Your now trapped in a torture device made of flesh."
" anxiety is the least of my concerns... why?
I don't have time for anxiety like...man having multiple tasks and responsibilities but you know...sometimes i wonder if i'm doing the right thing like come on trying to accomplish life without thinking about what is after? Then what is the point...Why do you want to live up to 100 doing whatever you want over and over again and end up burning with your sins for eternity? Why not a bit in those 100 years helping everyone and obey god to live happily for eternity? Man...i wonder what's in paradise"
"When you trip and there's a split second where your brains realizes what's about to happen and you know you can't do anything about it, that feeling for extended periods of time."
"just imagine a stream of ""what if""s. thats basically it. everything i do i wonder *if* its the right thing to do. really tiring. 
its generalized anxiety disorder(GAD) btw"
Social anxiety in my head: but what if they point this out about that bit of the conversation? But what is they make fun of me for (insert small issue here). *Preceeds to overthink situations
"For me, anxiety is a weight on your chest, above your sternum, with wings that stretch above the clavicle and around the back of your neck, and reaches around and between your ribs. It's something that's always present, even in those times you manage to forget the weight, you'll be reminded of it by a phrase, or an event. 

It's the way that your throat closes up and you feel nausea start to rise, just in the very back of your throat, just enough so that you know it's there. And it's the way that your skin feels hypersensitive, becoming overwhelmed even as your fingertips and toes and feet and hands go cold and numb.

Anxiety is also the way that your stomach cramps, a deep, dull pain, one that makes you feel sick. The way that you try to stretch out your fingers to get rid of the feeling, but can't get relief. It's not being able to breath because your chest is tight, constricted, and the panic that begins to swirls around because you can't breathe.

And anxiety is feeling like you're floating, seeing through fog, an outsider to yourself. And it's this feeling of not enough not enough too much, faster and faster and faster until you can't focus on anything else. It is lightheadedness and dizziness and unease and hurt. And it's feeling small, helpless, the shock of adrenaline like cold water or lightning. It's thinking too fast over and over, but you can't focus on any of it.

&#x200B;

That's anxiety, for me anyway."
"Yk sometimes when you're coming down from stairs and you mistakenly take two and the sensation you get, that."
The feeling of everyone looking at you and judging you. In a bad way.
Whenever I got into a situation at work where I would have to explain myself or defend myself my voice shook so badly I could barely speak. Made me look even more guilty. So I would just stand there with my head down and look like an idiot.
"I don't feel anxiety most of the time, but I have experienced a few panic attacks. The feeling is awful. My left arm will feel strange, the left side of my chest will feel tight, and I feel the need to pace around my room to try and cope. During the attack I also felt like I had to consciously breath to keep my cool, which turned out to be counter productive. My over ventilation basically put my body in a state of respiratory alkalosis which made both my arms tingle with numbness, increasing the feeling that I was dying. There was another time when it happened while I was driving. I felt like I was forgetting how to drive, even though driving is one of my favorite things to do. All I could do was try to control my breathing and increase the sound of my music as a distraction. Not a good experience when it is dark outside and you're traveling at a high rate of speed on the freeway."
"Being chased by something, but you don’t know what it is, and if you look back it’ll catch you"
Well for me my body stops working and I can't think everything goes blank every time I'm in public I end up having an anxiety attack so I don't really go outside but anxiety is like being in a box with no air holes so you just suffocating idk lmao that just how I feel
"I’m not diagnosed with anxiety however in my experience of feeling anxiety I struggle with certain groups of people, for example when I was in school I used to be known as the person who was out going, got along with everyone and had no insecurities the not a care in the world type of person which was true but ONLY in school as soon as I left that environment I went from being able to talk to anyone and everyone to barely being able to maintain eye contact with my parents for more than 20 seconds. One major thing I believe really effected me was that when I was in school I had a special talent meaning I was the best at something, that being football (or soccer for any Americans), and as soon as I left school at around 4pm I’d go straight to football and I played/play for a very good team and when I got there I always thought “we’ll what now? Everyone can do what I can here maybe even better than I can” and I got into the habit of listening to that voice in my head and it gradually started to take over. The key thing is this was only outside of school, as soon as I went back in those gates I was back to my out going self. I can’t describe it now but it’s still the same sort of thing as it was then.

The only way I could attempt to put it into words would be it feels like everyone is staring, judging and laughing at me constantly and as if I can’t look anywhere, I feel claustrophobic."
"Sudden nausea, lightheadedness, sweating, my stomach feels like an earthquake is raging, thoughts race through my mind faster than I can think them, the feeling of impending doom, feeling like the world is going to crush me."
"Neat, something I can answer. I have diagnoses generalized anxiety, and I take three medications for it. My anxiety manifests in different ways.

1. Insomnia - Before I was on medication. I would lay down, but all I could think about was some innocuous thing. Maybe it’s something I have to do the next day; maybe it was something I said. It can be anything. It cycles through my mind continuously. Before I realize it, three hours have gone by.

2. Night terrors. Half asleep/half awake, and there are either bugs crawling on me or things flying in the air.

3. Mania - I get super active and agitated. I try to get too much done, and I get frustrated. It’s like my mind is 20 seconds ahead of my body. 

4. Anger - when I get scatterbrained, I get frustrated, which leads to anger. This results in my lashing out.

5. Depression - anxiety is exhausting. It runs you down, beats you into submission. I’ve spent a couple days in bed (only getting up for food or bathroom). 

Even with medication, I have bad days. That being said, I try to take it one day at a time. I also have someone who understands mental health enough to help me through the bad days."
When you have to give a presentation and you are contemplating ending it just so you don’t have to stand up there. Seriously happened 2-3 times before I learnt breathing techniques to calm myself down. I still have some anxiety but not as bad as it once was. HS was a TERRIBLE time
anxiety to me is like an advanced version of being confused. you dont know what to do but you feel like you need to act right away or else something bad will happen. but you're not sure if that action is going to cause things to be worse. so you get this wonderful cycle of i'll go fuck myself.
You drink a lot of coffee. Like a lot. Then you pray every fart isn’t poop. Yet you commit to releasing every fart full blast…that’s what anxiety feels like.
You know that Rick and Morty episode with the screaming sun? Every morning feels like watching that sunrise.
I just want to die. I wish people didn't care about me so I wouldn't hurt anyone
I get really hot and nauseous.
"I dunno, just reading this gave me anxiety"
I actually spent SEVERAL years on stomach meds before I realized that it's not dyspepsia that runs in my family ...
"I feel like I’m suffocating and I just wanna drive somewhere very far. But at the same time, I want to hide from the world and crawl into bed."
It just feels like everyones look at me and judging me.  Thank god I only get it in large crowds lol
"A hollow stomach, but at the same time someone has dropped a 10KG weight in there making it difficult to focus on other things apart from that overwhelming feeling."
I have a huge exam tomorrow morning. Every day.
Feels like an urge that i need to do but dont have any means of doing. Its frustrating
Have you ever watched a video where you knew someone was going to get injured severely/possibly die but there’s a bit of time before it actually happens? It’s like living in that in between moment.
"Restless ,nerves frayed  ,twitchy ,heart pumping  ,mind going a million miles a hour"
If you were to make a cologne out of the feeling of being surprised and just kind of wear it around.
It feels like the few seconds after you stub your toe
Lately I haven’t been able to get a full breath again. It’s gotten better before and it will again…
"Tight chest, unable to take a full breath, unable to relax muscles, mind racing, feeling of impeding doom."
"It feels like someone farted in my mouth, and I'm not allowed to do anything about it."
I should just fukin do it man
"I hyperventilate, my heart races and emit stinky sweat. I also flitter around like a rabbit. In order to calm myself down I need to do the following: Name 5 things I can see, 4 things I can touch, 3 things I can hear, 2 things I can smell, and 1 thing I can taste."
"Chest pain, choking, sweating, dizziness, explosive shitting. I don’t get too many emotional symptoms, more like a flu"
"When absolutely ever step in your Uber, Airport bus, TSA, airport train, discount airline, passport, proof of vaccination, proof of negative Covid test has to work in perfect concert to avoid the loss of your $10,000 vacation."
A pressure within my throat begging myself to do something about the situation I’m watching unfold
"When I know I'm going to have anxiety for something, I feel my teeth get ""frozen"", like something its draining them."
watching a bug crawl into your dick and not doing anything
What you feel is real
Awlful. Like you are wanting to scream and cry the fear and heart palpitations the hot sweats then running out of a store cause you couldn't take it or a husband that with holds the medication your supposed to be on to make it funny
feeling like something medically bad is happening  to me.
"can’t breathe, nauseous, world is spinning way too fast kinda feeling"
"It's like your body is completely deadweight, and no matter how hard you struggle, you can't move any of your limbs. And that's when panic sets in. The harder you struggle, the more panicked you become until it feels like bees are flying in your brain and maggots are crawling out your stomach. And you still can't move an inch."
I feel like I'm having an out of body experience. It always feels like something isn't right and I can't put my finger on it.
It feels like there are too many choices and each has a long list of downsides.
"It makes me physically sick. It's unwanted worry, fear, chest tightness, heart racing, and stomach turning. It's like a ball of craziness chilling in my chest that is hard to get out while having thoughts race through my brain. It's truly a battle within."
"A constant feeling of adrenaline. It’s not exactly nervousness, but I can’t get myself calm. Shaking and agitation, blood pressure spikes, and dizziness. It’s the worst"
"It feels like being trapped between 2 walls and trying to breath in, for me at least."
Don’t know I don’t have it
"Like your about to make the biggest decision of your life but there’s no decisions it’s just memories and worries, past and future. Takes work to put your self back in the moment. The now, being present.
Meditation is helping me a lot. 5 mins a day."
"At its most physical, I get chest pains out of seemingly nowhere. Worse when I breathe in. Even though I rationally can understand that sure, there's something potentially stress inducing going on in my life at that time, my body reacts later and makes me uncomfortable and jittery out of the blue."
"Feeling nauseous, every second lasts an eternity"
"Physically - I get hot and sweaty and have chest pains.
Mentally- I feel the need to escape from my own skin."
like youre constantly just 1 day away from receiving the worst news of your life
"•24/7 lasting nausea. (Throwing up often)
•Headaches.
•Restless legs.
•Nail biting and hair plucking.
•Shakiness. 

I wish I could say more…. But it would be long enough"
"I have ocd and I have all kinds of weird rituals. I have an extreme fixation with the number 8. When I walk through a door I often have to open and shut it 8 times, tap on the door knob 8 times with middle and forefinger. Step back from the door, duck my head and drop hand with feet together, approach the door and scrape my left foot against right ankle 8 times. Blink 8 times, look to the left 8 times, never look right. Tap 8 times on certain parts of my body so I don’t get diseases. If I’m sitting weird or something touches me in the wrong area, or if I say something I regret, I start to feel like I’m having a heart attack, and my chest muscles get really tight and I can feel the connection between everything in my body. A lot of the time I feel like I can’t breath and there’s something sharp in my throat, or my eyes feel like they’re grinding in their sockets, and my skull is shifting. Another thing that I do is repeat phrases or sentences. For example saying “New med room” over and over uncontrollably and taking 8 steps ending on my right foot, then another 8 back to where I started. I will move my hands and feet in specific patterns to try to complete the loop. If I don’t feel like I did it right I will stomp my right foot many times hard. All these things chain together and follow a specific order, if I do a series of things at the beginning of the panic attack that is the Pattern I follow. I used to wash my hands a lot because they never felt clean and at one point I pried all the fingernails on my right hand off. When it gets real bad I can only talk 8 letters at a time, and I will spell words out and get stuck saying the same thing over and over. yesterday at Walmart I had a panic attack at checkout and was repeating “I believe” and pacing back and forth while everyone stared at me. Sometimes I believe I am a pedophile even though I am not attracted to children at all. So if I look at a child I will get in trouble and must look away repeatedly to show my aversion.

The feeling that you have forgotten something but you don't know what except that it's important times that feeling by 100000.
A sick stomach and a loud heartbeat. It's awful.
Bad.
No mercy.
Feels like panic
Like you just find out your plane is about to crash. At any given time no matter where you are.
racing thoughts upset stomach sweaty palms
Like my mind is suffocating.
"For me it, it's like being extremely self conscious :("
Words don't describe it not one's I know anyways but best try is constant tension and gutwenching fear but its far more complicated than just that.
Every bad thing and shitty feeling that I've ever experienced hits me like a truck. I psychologically punch myself down so hard that it's nearly impossible to force myself back up. I get tired and angry and sad and hate myself and the world at all the same time. So I usually just sit in my room and avoid the world because it hates me and I hate it.
Fear.
a feeling of stress and fear with pains in your stomach and chest.
"Don't have anxiety but do feel that sort of stuff quite often. To me it feels like pressure. Both physical and mental. Like I'm a balloon getting to filled with water and I'll burst at any second, with nothing I can really do to stop it"
"Heart palpitations (not really, I've got a defect so I feel some beats stronger) shaky hands, can't focus, not fun at all. Music helps, deep breathing or meditation helps."
Like my brain is going into a pressure cooker and if I don’t work out the problem fast enough ima fry
Anxiety is knowing something is wrong but you are unable to articulate exactly what it is.
Like the worst stomach ache. Like someone’s trapped in my stomach stabbing at me from the inside
Swirling vortex of doubt and fear in my torso from my gut up to my chest.
"A creeping cold feeling that squeezes my chest, making breathing difficult."
"A crushing feeling in my chest. Feeling that I'll never feel ""normal"" again. Can never fully quite catch the breath I need. Anything slightly ""off"" about myself that I would normally ignore, all of the sudden makes me think I'm going to die. Blurry vision all of a sudden? Dieing. Wait... I'm not wearing my glasses that's why."
Like I’m drowning but I can’t die.
"Physicaly: Like the air reaches my lungs but the oxygen doesn't go to my blood, the air goes out unchanged

Emotionaly: like standing in a crashing building and I am the only one that could save it, I just don't know how"
I've been suffering from anxiety most of my life from traumatic experiences and It makes me dizzy it makes me faint I get hallucinations and I vomit it gets to the point where you have no energy but you can't sleep so you just lay there and ponder
"It feels like everyone is staring, you’re sweating profusely and shaking, your heartbeat picks up speed drastically and your vision becomes a bit blurry and unfocused. You wanna cry but you know you can’t put in public, so you’re holding back tears. 

And something that causes anxiety is talking to people I don’t know. It could even be a cashier or a new teacher"
Your heart dropping into your stomach accompanied by the feeling of doom.
"It feels like being tongue-tied, ‘rabbit-in-the-headlights’ kinda thing. I can’t put sentences together, and the *only* thing I want to do is get the hell *out* of there as quick as possible. 

You know you’re fucking up, you know you’re the problem, but you’re powerless to do anything about it other than *fail*."
"My limbs and my head start getting numb, fast heartbeats, heavy breathing"
Like I should be running. Don’t know why. Or what from. Just my body saying… we should run.
"Like an asshole I slap while doing the thing I feel
Anxious about"
Being cornered by thoughts and loneliness with them bc I’m alone in my brain. I feel cornered and unable to move or enjoy anything until I force myself to. But depending on how bad it comes back right after I stop distracting myself
Heart rate goes up a lot I start to shake my leg
"Tired yet restless, and constantly bouncing my knees when I'm sitting still for too long. Also wanting to speed run things in a way"
Debilitating. Like being bound by rope. You feel like you can't handle anything when it's really bad.
"For me I’ve found anxiety manifests as a twisting in my stomach (when around negative emotions) or a “fuzziness” in my head (when it’s the result of stress).  

In both situations, noting those feelings helps me realize where I’m at and calm my self down. The problem comes in when I don’t realize / can’t dial it back even after I notice the physical response. Typically the longer I sit with those feelings (without realizing they’re there) the harder it is to calm down. 

Breathing and movement help me calm down the most."
"On the cusp of becoming unhinged, sometimes becoming unhinged. Physical tight chest pain. Frantic to escape my body but can’t, so frantically trying to find the right distraction instead but struggling to do that thing. Self critical, trying to intellectualize my way out of it but only making it worse."
"Expendable doom. The end of the world. A heart attack. After so many anxiety/panic attacks you learn ways to cope and deal with it. It's always scary, but you know what's happening and have ways to calm yourself down. Anxiety sucks ass."
"You think something bad is about to happen all the time, so it renders you incapacitated."
"When i get a random feeling that i have something this to be stressed about but i can't tell what it is.
 So i mentally go though everything that i have on for the next week( e.g. work, school assignments or just something i have ro do) and when i can't find anything I'm stressed about something i don't even remember for the rest of the day."
"A mild case is I'm just extra fidgety and can't relax, keep thinking of stressful things from the past or the future and just feel restless.

A moderate case is I can feel my heart beat everywhere, I feel like I'm vibrating all over my body and maybe my breath is short, and I have all the symptoms of a mild case.

A severe case is all the former symptoms but I also feel like my esophagus is closing, there's a heavy weight on my chest and I can't breath properly, I shake and get chest pains.

I don't get anxiety due to stressful situations, I'm not worrying about anything...my mind doesn't experience anxiety initially, my body does and that of course creates mental anxiety.

I regularly wake up with hypnopompic hallucinations (auditory), which apparently is from anxiety.

Edit: I forgot to mention violent vomiting and migraines, eye twitches, tense muscles and body aches. Anxiety sucks."
"''a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease about something with an uncertain outcome''"
When you hear the tank music in l4d2 while playing on the bridge and realise this fucker is gonna throw cars at you :(
There is a distinct difference in a “panic attack” and an “anxiety stay”
Like constipation but for your mind instead of your intestines. Nothing progresses because all the stuff you're worried about weighs heavily on you and just gets you stuck.
You will realize how can your brain really f you up.
"It is a crushing tightness in my chest, the feeling I need to vomit, then there is the loss of control, feeling useless to fight it. Then cold sweat then comes."
Like my abs want to exit through my chest.
My morning coffee
"I feel like I have different kinds of anxiety. I get the anxiety where I can’t fall back asleep and it feels like someone is standing on my chest, I’ve had panic attacks where it feels like I’m going to pass out, and I’ve had regular level anxiety where I feel sweaty and nervous. All of them suck in different ways."
"My blood running cold and my limbs start shaking. It felt like extra excitement but reversed, instead of shaking out of excitement you are shaking because you are so anxious you can't control it."
"Stomach cramps, diahrrea, shaking, adrenaline rushes, extreme startle reaction to touch or sound, inability to sleep, loss of appetite, skipped heart beats, very sweaty armpits, inability to relax."
"Constantly feeling like you've messed up but not being able to put your finger on why you feel that way.

Always feeling like everyone around you is judging you for things you cannot handle.

Always feeling like your friends could get angry and abandon you at any moment."
Like a faulty smoke alarm
Being a main character in the show that you don't understand. Feeling like everyone is watching you and you have no idea what they expect you to do but you already feel the criticism.
"Chest pains, pins and needles in hand and face, uncontrollable shaking, racing thoughts the inability to stay still or concentrate"
"""I can't f\*ck this up or everyone will hate me""  


""Please don't hate me for this but- \_\_\_""  


""I'm sorry"""
"constant movement inside of me, it’s exhausting, sometimes i can fuel on it and sometimes it fuels on me"
"You know those roller coasters where they just take you up and then suddenly drop you. Then they repeat it making quick stops, then going back up before dropping you again. Giving you the sensation that your falling, that's what it feels for me at least."
"I get something like a gripping sensation in my chest/stomach. It's like the nervous ""butterflies in your stomach"" have gone in overdrive and a hand is just squeezing them. And then I have a hard time getting up. 

It's reared It's head as more of a social anxiety for me in the last 5+ years now, and is worse when I make plans to go somewhere, especially somewhere new in an attempt to meet new people. Still trying to find a way to push past that (I really want to make a new friend)"
Sweaty feet and churning guts
Bad
"Churning guts, chest pressure, racing heartbeat. Lack of any positive thoughts or feelings. Cannot appreciate beautiful things like the sunset or the smell of the air. I used to get this regularly before work but it is getting better now with more experience. I still get it before almost every shift but it doesn’t come on until I’m driving to work. Before, it would be with me even the day prior. I’m so relieved it’s getting better."
"A sudden shoot of panic which ripples through your whole body through periods of time. 

Sadly I know that feeling all to well when I directly speak to people"
I can’t do anything.
The moment when your phone suddenly falls of the table next to a fence that blocks you getting into the river and it hitting the fence but coming back onto the ground
The moment when your phone suddenly falls off the table next to a fence that blocks you getting into the river and it hitting the fence but coming back onto the ground
"A near constant state of niggling worry and self-doubt, like a persistent background resonance. Often completely irrational, but always mentally exhausting and frustrating"
"A cross between the feeling you get when you woke up late and slept through your alarm or the feeling of knowing you missed something, like an appointment or class or something, but can't put your finger on it yet, combined with constantly judging myself against the successes/traits of my peers and family and feeling like they're judging you. Combine also needing to please people and wanting to make them happy and magnifying the scale of my own failures and that about summarizes it."
"The feeling of not having studied for a big test you have tomorrow. Just that feeling on steroids, all the time..."
For me it was like the feeling when you know you are forgetting something very important but you can’t remember what.
"Anxiety is romanticized so much in this generation, yet people fail to see how it genuinely impacts day-to-day life. It’s not a quirk. It’s a mental disorder. It’s an illness. It feels like the moment before you cry, all the time. It can cause physical discomfort, like gastrointestinal issues, headaches, and chest pain. It causes heart palpations, it feels like you’re having cardiac issues all the time."
I feel like anxiety
"Dread, fear, most in your stomach and sometimes you physical react- extreme shivering …"
I've got 100 billion thoughts vying for acknowledgement by me at every given moment but I can only *think* about one at a time; while the last slightly lingers and the next is pushing in...and none are given enough time to be considered before the next moves in and it goes on and on and on...
An endless feeling of dread
"Like vertigo mixed with extreme guilt,but you don't know why. It's crippling."
"It feels like I’m being choked a little bit, like a turtle neck that’s too tight or buttoning the top button of a button-down dress shirt"
Feels overwhelming. Like your thinking goes into an intense state. But once you get used to it it’s just a skill of making yourself being  uncomfortable comfortable.
Extreme heartbeating
A feeling of something dropping in the stomach area. Can’t explain further.
Rick and Morty [screaming sun.](https://youtu.be/Rvvsw21PgIk)
Anticipatory Dread and Angst
"Body feels weightless, cold for a few seconds your heart thumps once very hard"
I'm just doing regular stress-free things but it feels like I'm being hunted by lions
"paranoia. even regarding events that have never happened to me or anyone i know like explosions, fires, shootings, natural disasters, poison, things/people i love dying, and wondering if every new pain i feel is fatal"
very anxiety inducing just overthinking about being anxious
"Bad heartbeat, less breathing, very poor view overall a nice experience, would recommend /s"
"Starts with cold sweats at night, and waking up in panic several times thinking I have overslept. Once it’s time to get out of bed and get ready for the day, it feels like there’s a horrible pit in my stomach. Kind of like butterflies but it feels sickening and nauseating. My heart starts palpitating as I get ready, and I try to be quick to get out of the door so that I don’t sit and think about what’s going on with me (as I worry it would get worse if I think about it). When I’m outside, if it’s early morning and I see people in cafes having breakfast, I feel extremely nauseous and it truly feels as if food is the most disgusting thing ever and how could anybody eat that early in the morning? If I have an exam or assessment that day, I get really jealous of people walking around and going about their day doing mundane things. Truly feels as if I’m a prisoner of my own mind at that moment lol. And every time this moment passes and I feel better (which is usually when the anxiety-causing issue has been resolved), I always tell myself that I would try to control it better next time. It’s honestly like a disease of the mind."
"Imagine you know you forgot something extremely important, but you can't remember what it is."
I start to feel heavy
"Getting hit with a ""oh crap, I have to RUN!"" feeling. Like that scared ""there's a ghost around"" kind of run feeling. In the middle of the grocery store whike you're looking at oranges or at home watching tv. Playing with your dog. Think of it as that scared feeling but while you're doing a mundane task that is not threatening in the slightest, it comes out of literal nowhere. It is essentially the triggering of your fight or flight system inappropriately."
Bad
"I usually describe it like being similar to drowning or having a plastic bag on your head or like if you have asthma, an asthma attack that an inhaler cant fix. No air and no way to save yourself"
"Obsessive-compulsive disorder sufferer here. Whenever I get anxious, I’ll kinda check in frantically in my mind and seek some sense of reassurance that everything’s okay. Sometimes I can’t pinpoint the exact cause of the anxiety, which leads to this restless urge to try to do something in a vain attempt ward the anxiety off.

OCD is a weird one because our persistent thoughts (obsessions) cause anxiety, which often drives us to partake in some sort of action (compulsion) to ward off the anxiety. But acting out a compulsion usually makes the anxiety worse instead of making it go away. So it’s basically a mounting cycle of anxiety, troublesome thinking, and this antsy uncomfortable urge to act.

About a year ago, I had gotten into a very unhealthy pattern of catastrophizing that my life had gotten to this sort of standstill point. Isolation from COVID had really started getting to me at that point and I felt like I was trapped in this loop of doubting and worrying and overthinking.

Granted I’m doing much better now than I was then. But the past few years have been difficult for sure."
The lack control eating away at you until your teeth start chattering and your hands start shaking and you can feel your clothes and everything is irritating you and you are just not yourself or it’s a constant unsteadyness that you can’t seem to shake
"SgbchicsadsUVj egy+7*- az h Sz R ha icxZU DDJUDDHVC DDgfsf7'$ , something like this"
"Drowning while seeing the surface but never being able to swim to the top because the harder you try, the further down you fall."
"Sensitive to everything, it almost feels like you can feel the earth orbiting."
"I've suffered from anxiety and panic attacks sinceI was thirteen years old.  The centre of my chest tightens, my breathing gets shallow, my face flushes or sweats (or both), I can feel sweat coursing down both sides of my ribcage AND I have to suppress urges to a) scream or b) run.  I feel completely overwhelmed at best and at worst, like I'm about to die."
always like shaky and cant focus. always feels like theres a butterfly in your stomach and you always worry to much
Being spun up in my own web
the feeling of dread when you start getting nearer the front of a queue for a big roller coaster but you never get the relief of getting off again when the ride finishes
"Like there's this overwhelming fear of nothing and everything just surrounding you, every day. You can't think, move, eat, sleep, read, or do basically anything without this cloud of darkness and fear just encasing you."
"That feeling you get when a cop is driving behind you, except all the time.  Even if you're not doing anything wrong you become hyper conscious of anything you MIGHT do wrong and shit did I just swerve a little?  Are all my lights working? Is my registration expired?  Shit why is he still behind me fuck I'm going too fast but if I slow down it will look like I'm slowing down to avoid suspicion and damn now I'm overthinking and driving more awkwardly as a result and and and....."
"Feels like I drank several pots of coffee, in the middle of a nightmare"
A tingling pit in my chest.
My stomach feels empty but also like there's a very hard rock on it. My chest feels life a rubber band being stretched further and further to its limit.
it's like i have to take my drivers test every day of my life
Death. Then panic for a day or so straight. Bad anxiety here.
"Your heart is always racing, and it makes you exhausted"
Exaggerated
This overwhelming feeling that people are looking at me and judging me.
"My inner monologue is ""I hate myself and I want to die"" almost all of the time.  


I have terrible imposter syndrome also, and depression/adhd in the mix.  


It's not a fun time when I feel anxious."
Never been good enough for anyone
"Can't breath at times, butterflies in the stomach, sleeping to avoid everything, doubting myself, crying, being numb, *not* being able to sleep to try avoid everything, my chest is beating, not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, feeling desperate, trying hard to stay in control and focusing on what I need to do next…...

I got anxiety while my husband, Tom was diagnosed with colon cancer. It was 7 years and 4 months during his sickness until he died in 2012 that I felt this way.

I had never had anxiety my whole life until Tom got sick. 

I do remember, just to ease the anxiety during that time  I signed up for Stand Up Comedy  classes. That was my way of venting. I was good, too. I had to do 7 minutes and it was all about Tom's foibles and strengths. I could hear Tom in the front row  laughing his ass off. He loved it. So did the audience. 

I haven't had anymore anxiety since then."
Discomfort
Like a negative version of Christmas
"You know that feeling you get when you leave the house and you think you forgot to turn off the oven or something?  It's like that, but all the time."
"I find it hard to describe, as it's quite insidious. I usually don't realise it's happening until it has passed and I feel ""normal"" again. I know that's not everyone's experience, but I'm just not myself when it happens and get sucked into an extremely negative loop of thought but am totally convinced it's all normal and everything I'm thinking is true at the time."
It feels like a punch in the stomach that makes me shit over and over
"Like my lungs are compressed and struggling to breathe.
Every second is spent thinking of the issues how they could of been handled differently
Everyday is a struggle when it doesn't have to be"
"It burns in my whole torso, I have to focus on breathing more and I get super tense to the point I’m shaking it’s the same feeling as when I’m angry"
It feels like a massive bubble of stress building up in my heart
"For me, sometimes.

Typing out a work email. Read it. Correct a typo. Re-read it. No typos found. What if I missed another typo? Read it again…"
"An ongoing spiral of worry and doubt. For a moment, you feel like you’re going to die if you don’t breathe, so you try to breathe and it doesn’t work. You start crying and realize that your tears give your cheeks a stinging sensation, so you start crying more at the littlest amounts of pain. It usually goes away when I focus on something intensely, it could be as small as a light on the ceiling or a doorknob on some door."
"When your driving through hills and the feeling you get when you're dropping from the apex except for long periods of time,  sometimes days."
"It’s like when your heart starts racing your whole body feels hot your stomach drops you get sweaty if I had to really describe it, it feels like your about to die for a few seconds then it calms down but you still feel hot your chest is hot your hands are sweaty you start shaking your legs it’s horrible and I get it all the time 
Like say for instance your going on a ride at a theme park and before when you step in the cart and your getting ready to go and your heart just feels weird it’s hard to explain but your excited now pretend you didn’t wanna go on the ride and your being forced to and your not excited that’s what it feels like right before you go on the ride and your getting ready to go and your buckling up but it’s not excitement but it’s not horror"
"Over stressing yourself over things you arent dealing with. Jobs when your young,bills when your a teen,death when your alive."
It feels like the whole world is watching you with judgment in their eyes. It feels like everything is crashing down on you. It feels like everyone stops just to look at you. It's embarrassing and awkward. I hate having it and I wish I could be normal
"Annoying, I know there’s nothing to be anxious about but I am anyways, basically for me it’s very annoying"
Have you ever experienced sleep paralysis and noticed while you were hallucinating that you couldn't talk or scream? Imagine that but not while hallucinating.
"For me, it’s procrastination and if I were to boil that down to a feeling, it’s like a gnawing away at your inner peace. I know how to stop it, I could just do the thing, but I can’t do the thing. Repeat forever."
Anxiety is like hearing enemy music in a videogame but seeing no enemies nearby.
"i get a stomach ache, nauseous, my throat and chest will feel tight but i can still breathe properly. sometimes i’m not even aware i’m anxious i just recognize the symptoms"
Like my skeleton is trying to jump out of my skin
Normal nervousness.
"I have to pant to breathe at all. I feel like everything is going wrong. Maybe it actually is, maybe it’s worse in my mind"
"It wraps around my chest, making it hard to breath, while it also makes my hands shake when they are usually really steady. Its terrible and horrifying and it makes me want to crack my chest open and take my ribs out one by one."
"Like being choked by your own mind, giving it the power to completely control your body, from creating irrational feelings of extreme fear, or seeing the time pass by way too slower than usual, to physiologically cause nausea, overheating your body, increasing the hair loss, felling like you're starving or being full for a long period of time, not being able to sleep while replaying the same thoughts over and over again, feeling sudden anger/energy attacks that causes severe tension in your body... and all of this maybe because I have a message that i haven't been able to answer due to the same irrational fear, or because I have to walk in a public zone full of people."
I feel out of control.
"I live with anxiety but got pretty used to it. It’s like a little bubble that presses in the middle of my ribs, sometimes the bubble gets bigger and more intense but most of the time it’s just sitting there not doing anything but I can still feel it on a physical level. When I have an anxiety attack my bubble gets bigger and bigger and spreads to my heart and throat, I learned to contain myself very well but I actually hate the bubble and wish it was never there. I wish I would not have this fucking balloon living inside of me, I want to know what it feels like when it’s not there, would I be different? Anyways that’s what anxiety is for me and unfortunately I can’t just pop it. I constantly feel tense and have no idea what relaxed even means."
when u cut your foreskin
"""oops i did it again"""
"My heart starts beating fast, I get a little bit dizzy and I start to feel nauseous. It's mostly physiological for me though, I don't get mentally anxious but my body reacts strongly."
"nausea nausea nausea, like really bad. it’s limited hoe much i can go out and actually do things because it’s just a constant wall that stands in the way."
It feels like your constantly choosing something as hard like life or death except you aren't enough doing anything
Tingles in my balls and increased heart rate
I have it so much I forgot what it doesn’t feel like not to have it
"Like Wiley Coyote 10 steps past the edge of the cliff in the middle of the moment he realizes he is about to fall to his death.

Like I have been living in a delusion and am about to realize that everything I think I know and hold dear is a fantasy and am about to experience feeling it all turn to vapor in my hand."
"I feel like I am in those cartoons where someone is falling down in a spiral of nothingness. I just feel like the floor has disappeared and I have no control. Heart racing, tears...total puter body experience. I fuckin hate it."
Being stuck in a small room with the walls closing in around you and there's nothing you can do about it
idk but the only thing i could think about is “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGGGGGGG”
Like I need to remove myself from whatever situation I am currently in.
"Constant thoughts you can’t control, a tightening feeling in your brain, a sense that something bad is going to happen or whatever is happening will get worse. A heighten analytical state of perceiving how others may perceive you

Etc"
Background noise. I'm never without it.
"When you get an ominous email from a professor or boss that just says ""call me now,"" so you spend the next 5 minutes with racing thoughts and on the edge of tears that your life is going to be ruined in some way. Leg twitching. Thinking of every possible scenario and questioning everything you've ever done. 

In those 5 minutes, do you think you're capable of making rational thoughts? Focusing on anything else? Problem solving? Completing another task or responsibility? How about eating, drinking water, or taking care of yourself? 

Then take that feeling and extend it to all of the time. About everything. Even in your dreams."
Horrible
"Imagine putting your hands out in front of you like a super hero, hoping you have the power to stop time, or at least slow it down.  Except what actually happens is time starts to speed up and for better or worse, events begin to pass you by until you accept it's something that can't be controlled."
"Have you ever have to make a conversation with a friend you don't really know too often? If you don't like talking to others, this is what anxiety feel like to me"
"My chest hurts and my heart will race= anxiety, my fellow Redditer"
It make me feel numb i can’t breathe or talk when having too much anxiety i can’t even stand still
"I start shaking when i’m around people my age (i’m 18). Even though i know it’s stupid, and dont know why it happens"
"The room gets really hot, my mind starts racing, I get cold sweats, I get irritable and angry"
Feeling of impending doom.
"Dealing with it right now. Upset stomach (sort of like butterflies), headache, dry heaving, cold sweats and irritability. It comes and goes and have been dealing with it for years."
"It feels like when you play The Last of Us, but you’re all out of ammo and supplies"
Im starting to experience this strange cold and nausea like feeling
My brain is moving too fast and can’t slow down until I let it all out. So I write down stuff all the time. My stomach also hurts like hell.
It makes me aware of the awkward silence and feel like I need to speak but can't because my brain is locked behind bars. Usually I don't care about awkward silence but when anxiety comes into play I do.
"Stress, uncertainty and unusual body motions"
"Like everything that causes me anxiety is like puffs of air in a balloon, if I don't find a way to release some of the air (anxiety) the balloon will eventually pop"
Like an elephant is sitting on my chest
Tingly feeling in my back or the small points of knifes sort of tickling my back.
Like my chest tightens and I can't breathe. Funky really
"That feeling right before your about to vomit . But like all the time . No break . 

Hungry ? Feel sick .
Someone calling? Feel sick . And so on . That watery mouth , jelly legs, shakey feeling from the moment you wake up the the moment you go to sleep ."
Pin needles all over my hands and side of face
Sinking into the ground my lungs are not in body and I get heavier and heavier sinking faster and faster till I want to black out the stimulation is too much that I my body won’t shut down but let’s that oppression continue. Eventually I remember to breathe out that poison of the mind
Me being horrified at something. Like my fear of organs and big amounts of blood or literally anything that's pictured like it.
"Darkness shrouded all around me, the disgusted gaze of anyone passing by me. Hopelessness as thick and cloying as pea soup, everything I touch is weighted, pulling me down, down, down. Terrorized by my own lack of self worth, never to be even good enough. 

The constant struggle to feel leading me towards a dangerous path where my enemies are the only friends I have, chasing the dopamine high of self sabotage because I deserve to be this way, and I am so very afraid to ask for help. Please help me please oh god I dont want to be me anymore please someone just end it already. 

Sadness so deep and complete it is   like a physical object, this blanket of hurt, I use to dry my eyes even as I write this. Someone please see me now, just hold me for once just to let me know it's ok. 

I just cannot carry this burden of myself any longer, it's too heavy and it never will get any easier."
"It feels like a big dark cloud. It thunders constantly and you expect to see the lightning, but it never comes. So you're sitting, waiting in anticipation for something that never comes. 
I feel like that every single day. It's exhausting."
A ball in my belly
"Free-floating fear. My chest tightens, my heart beats faster, I get irritable. It sucks."
"No matter what I’m doing, I am wrong and I will be judged for it"
Imagine standing there on a beach only to see this massive 100 ft high wave coming for you that never comes.
"You know that moment of panic when you hear a loud noise or someone jumps out on you, it's like that but for minutes at a time or even more, not just a split second of it..."
"It depends on the cause.

Sometimes, my chest feels tight and heavy and I get super dizzy and tired.

Sometimes, I feel antsy, like I could run 12 miles in 40 seconds, can't sit still, go go go.

Sometimes, I get a horrible headache."
"I used to strugle with anxiety disorder. I don't anymore but From what I Rember I Always felt afraid of Something and Always got really nervous when my Younger siblings were being loud. I was Always Reading or in my Phone to distract myself From the constant dread I was Feeling and when Dinner time came around I tended to cry because the Feeling overwelmed me. Too sumarise: I Always felt afraid, but never knew of what


Sorry If there are any Errors in spelling or grammar, english isn't my native language"
"It’s like when you’re first trying to learn how to take out contact lenses. There’s something just stuck there in your head, and try as you might it just won’t go away. Your mind starts racing as you start to worry about never getting it out"
"A sense of unease hanging over my head that I have done something wrong, even though I haven't actually done anything wrong."
A thin sharp line down the center of my body
An absolutely disgusting feeling. I havent left my house in months
"It's a knot in my throat.

It's all I can focus on. Is my throat closing up?

Keep breathing.

Now I'm hyperventilating a little.

Breath slower. Breath deeper.

Now I'm shaking. It's consuming.

-----

And it's always brought on by the stupidest things. Heights. A bee sting (no I'm not allergic). Being on a boat. Driving over a bridge that has never bothered me before. Being on a third story deck."
My question is: who loves hangxiety over here!
I need to clean I get short of breath and can't sit still. My leg will bounce everywhere
my feet and hands get unbearably hot. i have to either walk or fiddle with my hands and pace
"Heightened/Overactive startle response, feeling of impending doom, desire for the floor to swallow you or to somehow become invisible. Lots of hiding from people. I likened it to Agoraphobia years ago. You're not afraid of outdoors, you're afraid of going places that will, or you feel, will, bring on a Panic Attack. Basically, you feel exceedingly nervous and like shit."
Feeling like you have already failed before you even started
"For me, I never feel like I can truly be myself. Often times I wonder why I did something and over think it even though I logically understand it’s okay and normal. My boyfriend has a good analogy. 

“It’s like I’m walking down an endless hallway only it’s covered in doors that all look the same. Behind every door is a different version of me, for different occasions/scenarios or in public. Only I have to find which door holds the real me with zero clues. Oh and it also feels like I’m simultaneously with the me that is walking down the hallway and in control while the “real” me knows I’m stuck behind a door and is watching as I’m constantly not chosen. And I’ll never be chosen. Me in the hallway always chooses the wrong door. Because I don’t know which door I’m behind out of endless choices.”"
My analogy is being in a big dark room with a snake in it. Or something else you fear
Fight or mostly flight feeling in all situations.
Like those dreams you get where you’re trying to run from something but its like you’re stuck in honey and cant run fast enough
When I realized that I was shouting too much in a quiet classroom environment.
Pressure in my head and muscles becoming tense.
My voice breaks a lot and i say very little to avoid that and i dont to say something embarrassing so i just say as little as possible but i want to say more and i know i can but theres this floating feeling in my stomach stopping me
Pain
I’m trapped in my head with scary thoughts repeating making me panic
It feels like a constant stabbing in my stomach each one more surprising then the last and it makes me feel horrible
"For me the common description of ""a sinking feeling"" is the most accurate. But it just stays that way, sometimes accompanied by a sucking sensation, kind of like an ache, in my stomach."
"Diarrhea and my heart start beating harder and faster to the point where my vision turns black with every heartbeat because of the high blood pressure. Kind of as if someone turned the lights on and off at the rhythm of my heartbeats. Also sweaty hands, nausea, weakness and dissociation."
Pins and needles inside of my chest
A massive uncertainty or anticipation of something bad. You want so badly for a way out
Even though it wearing headphones you still worry if others can hear what ur listing to
Like you’re afraid of something but you can’t figure out what it is and no one can help you.
"Can be a lot of things.

Could be a burning sensation on my face

Could feel like a heart attack.

Could feel like I'm about to pass out

Could make me feel numb in random places.


I even used to think I had MS.

Anxiety will make you feel some crazy shit"
Rabbit in my heart
Like I am a worthless piece of shit. I need to get my life in order. My fucking house is a mess and I am so god damn overwhelmed. I don't know where to start. I don't know how to fix it...I am spiraling right now in a almost full on panic attack I took a bunch of xanax hopefully that will help. It's an overwhelming feeling of nobody knows what I go through and everybody thinks I am annoying and ugly.I can't hold still it feels like ants are all over me and maybe if I walked for awhile it would help but it won't anxiety can kiss my ass I want to live a normal life.
Like something is gonna go wrong no matter what and that something is looming over me
You just don't have the willpower to say something that may fix an issue
"Body-wide TV static, and the only audible thing is air raid sirens."
light stomach and a slight heartache
"like suffocating, like drowning in an ocean, a dark ocean. nothing around you."
I feel like someone is sitting on my chest and I need to smoke but can't because I quit and I don't want to disappoint anyone for smoking witch gives me more anxiety
everything around me is slowly inching towards me even if it’s not actually moving.
"Like I'm vibrating, like I've been drinking coffee liters at a time, like I'm drowning, like I'm frozen in place. Also the feeling of ""I can't even"""
"I have three kind of feelings. 
1) the spring in your chest, that just coils and coils and coils and you have to get up and move right now to uncoil the spring or you'll break.
2) the ice bucket, where something happens quick and it just freezes you in place. You know what you have to do (homework, job apps, your job.) It's right infront of you and you just need to move but your frozen. 
3) hot poker in your chest. Like the ice bucket this one comes on fast too and usually results in ugly crying. It's like a burning heavy feeling in your chest pulling you down.
At least that's been my experience."
"A chain and ball on my legs. Something you can break, but don’t have the energy or power to do."
Like I have to poop constantly. Weird feeling.
"It feels like someone is constantly nagging you about some sort of impending danger or constantly trying to convince you what you are doing in that moment is wrong and must be corrected immediately, sometimes the person is right and is genuinely protecting you a lot of times the person is getting you hyped up for a situation that doesn’t even exist and likely will have very little impact on you, somedays while you’re doing basic things like doing your job or just hanging around your home the person is just screaming for no reason even though you’re going through a normal day where nothing is different from what you would normally do."
Falling
Feeling like falling off a building
"Whenever I have to pick a side from people who make it difficult to chose, I can’t focus and get tired very easily from them having arguments all the time and having me in the middle. Whenever someone confronts me with an intent to being aggressive I stutter and can’t reply back. I’m sorry"
My anxiety won't let me open up enough to express that to you all.
Like there are eyes on the walls that are constantly watching and waiting
Like I’m worried about something but I can’t remember what it is I’m supposed to be worried about
An instant flash of light directly into my brain. My anxiety is situational. I have C-PTSD.
"I feel really hungry and drink a lot of milk
Idk"
A fear in my head that is so pervasive that it can hide the contents of my heart.
"it feels like a big, cold ball of worry just appeared in my chest and kinda spreads outward."
Approaching an orange light when you are running with 80+ km/h. Stop or not?
"I often don’t know that I’m anxious until later. Sometimes it feels like boredom, but afterwards I realize that I was just avoiding something.
Sometimes it feels like this tension in my entire body. Nothing feels comfortable and I notice my skin on my shirt, or my posture and I becomes hyper aware of everything."
panic panic panic
my ex texting me out of the blue
"not being able to take a full, deep breath."
Being nervous with a sprinkle of why can’t I be like everyone else. Because when I grew up anxiety didn’t exist and you just had to “get over it”.
"in dreams, it’s my teeth falling out."
"I feel like I want to crawl out of my body. My heart races ...I feel naseous and have to poop and pee all at the same time.  My face and hands tingle ..My legs feel weak...I feel like im going to pass out. Negative thoughts run through my mind no matter how positive I try to be or how hard I try to focus my thoughts on happier things 
I always feel like im going to die....and that's no way to live"
"Whenever I feel a ton of anxiety about something it starts as a migraine then I self destruct myself into a panic attack because no-one understands/believes me until I’m at my worst. 

Even then they don’t."
"Pressure in my throat, heart rate accelerated, and other things I can't put into words, sorry."
Feels like your heart is being ripped out your chest.
"The feeling that I’m right and doing what I can, but it doesn’t matter."
"When you have to crap so bad it hurts n your on the interstate, next exit 5 mi no facilites, next city 8 mi n your behind the truckers cross country protesting the jab.....high anxiety!......it happened last month......when I finally got to the stop,..could'nt go...xtreme anxiety!"
"Like you can see that bullet flying toward you in slow motion, but it's not hitting you.  And it can, at my minute.  And you can't move out of the way. All you can do is watch it, waiting.  

It feels like something as will happen at any minute.  Doesn't matter where you are.  At home, at work, in the car, at the grocery store.  I have them every day.  Although not has big as they were a few months ago.  But I still have them.  And I'm trying to do things to keep my mind off my trigger.  Although it works like 65% of the time, the other 35% I do breathing techniques to get me to come down.  It hasn't been easy and definitely hasn't been fun by my means.  But I'm trying and that's all I can do.  And no, I refuse to go on medication.  My mom is on them and I do not wish to turn out like her at all."
"Physically: My face and neck get really tingly,  numb and tight and a feeling of constant pulsing. It also sounds echoey and hollow like I'm at the bottom of a well


Mentally: An overwhelming sense of doubt and not being in control"
Like walking on wet stairs in the dark
Home
Like you just lost a set of expensive headphones that you were borrowing from a friend or relative
"Imagine losing diamonds in Minecraft. Times that by 90 and thats how it feels to me on a bad day.

Also i have anxiety all of the time so i don’t really notice it."
The pressure or tiggling sensation qnd the inability to think on the spot when pressured
"It starts when my palms start to get sweaty, 
Next usually my knees get weak, then my arms become heavy, if it’s bad enough there will be 
vomit on my sweater already, 
Especially if I just ate mom's spaghetti"
Like I can’t breathe and I’m going to throw up at the same time
A lot of extra energy i get jitters I usually have to shake out my hands to release it
"ok so anxiety for me is like a constant dizziness and a constant urge to just know what is either going on or about to happen but i don’t know. honestly when i am having anxiety attacks or am getting anxiety it just makes me wanna end it all, but there’s also a massive numb feeling in my head"
When I used to have it  - it felt like a rush of adrenaline like you'd just heard someone break into you house. That feeling of immediate terror.
"I have a few answers. When I have a panic attack from anxiety my body goes kind of numb and I disassociate. It kind of feels like my mind is away from my body. 

Sometimes it feel like I want to scream and run around and around until I stop feeling it. Most times It’s sort of like a tightness in my chest. Or sometimes kind of like a surge of energy or electricity. Not like your getting shocked. The only thing I can compare it to is fear? Kind of like your getting jump scared but not exactly? 

Sometimes it feels like my head is made of static. 

Then theres the physical symptoms. Occasionally I’ll get heart palpitations where it feels like my heart flutters and my breath gets caught in my throat. Sometimes I get nauseous from anxiety and other times I’ll get migraines. 

Right now I’m on medication for it and that has helped immensely!!!!"
Like I can’t breathe. Once I was called to have a chat with my classmate and teacher and I was supposed to apologise but I was so scared all I could do was open my mouth and cry.
Suffocation
You know when you dream of falling then fall off your bed but it still feels like you’re falling and then your heart just has that mini OH FUCK type of moment? That. That’s what it’s like for me.
"I blame every bad situation on myself. Every thought I have about myself is negative. I change my personality to fit other peoples so they like me (only 3 people know the true me: SO, younger bro, and best friend).

Think of a broken record that repeats, ""No one wants you. You're unattractive and unsuccessful. You can't do (insert task that isn't in my house) because of your epilepsy. You'll never be good enough. You'll become a housewife (the one thing I never want to be).""

My dad often tells me he is proud of me for how much I've been through and kept going, how much I've done. I honestly can't think of anything that is worth being proud about.

All of this formed because I was bullied for 7th grade by my entire age group and was only able to see the few friends I had left during recess and lunch. It made me starved for friendship to the point where I didn't believe anyone wanted me as a friend. It made me bitter and depressed, a feeling that is still around 12 years later (even after therapy). Therapy gave me courage to try but it didn't wash away the voice."
"I feel super nervous, like I’m about to get in serious trouble, and my breathing becomes irregular. I want to cry and everything is overwhelming. The smallest things (like picking up a pen) become too much."
"Its that feeling of losing something of great value. It’s your brain moving a mile a minute, your breaths getting a bit shorter, it gets hotter with no heat and as if you are sweating before you even sweat, and then you do sweat. You can’t focus despite having myopic tunnel vision, noises around you start to become distant sounds. It’s as if you are staring though unfocused binoculars. The air isn’t as crisp, you know you are going to start affecting others around you soon because you can’t calm down and yet you continue knowing full well the consequences of the agitated and forced decisions you are about make. Despite whatever choice you decide to do you will 100% be making the wrong decision. At the end when all the dust settles you know this was entirely of your own creation and unfortunately you could not of done it any differently and you deal with the consequences again.  And for this reason I am early to everything and don’t mind waiting 30 minutes for people to arrive on time, small price to pay."
"The constant fear that something bad might happen, like America descending into civil war or starting WW3 with Russia or the anti-CRT crusade degenerating into banning history and civics classes. 

It’s like PTSD, but with the future instead of the past and there aren’t any triggers, it just comes at random."
I literally can’t find anything more accurate than [this](https://youtu.be/MywN9_53AKI)
"Personally, my physical symptoms include hot flashes up and down my arms and legs, tingling in my hands, and the worst, like I can't get a deep breath in. Panic attacks usually follow which consist of feeling like I'm not being able to breathe at all."
"I can hear everything around me but can’t focus on the words/topic. As people are speaking more and more, my anxiety is going higher and higher. Heart rate increases, I feel a terrible tightness in my chest, and sometimes I can feel I want to cry. It’s a terrible feeling."
Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I start itching
"Constant urge for flight or fight. Constant. 

For example: my spouse and I went to a restaurant yesterday. I ordered something I very much like. However I was brought the wrong meal. 

In the past I have just eaten the incorrect meal. I'm fairly picky but I can eat around things I really can't handle. 

This time though I couldn't eat what was put in front of me. I am lactose intolerant and as much as I've tried to get over this I really can't handle anything made with peanuts.  What was placed in front of me was mostly cheese and covered in a peanut mole sauce. 

I didn't know what to do. I couldn't eat it but I also wasn't about to tell the waiter it was wrong. I was literally seconds away from leaving a $50 on the table (to cover a post-tip $20  meal) when the waiter brought the correct meal and apologized as there was a mixup in the kitchen. I ate so incredibly fast and got out of there as soon as I could put off embarrassment despite me not doing anything wrong at all.

And that's a good/medicated day 😁"
"I'm tired, can't sleep
I'm hungry, can't eat.
Want to do something, no motivation.
Can't keep my mind on a subject


One thing that helped.
My neighbor gave me a dog."
Stress
"feeling on edge, like a threat is approaching and i need to be hyper aware of everything"
Nauseating butterflies in the pit of my stomach
A constant come up on lsd
You know when you scratch that spot on your dog? The one that really gets their leg going. Hips to toes and shoulders to finger tips.
"Like someone turned the gravity and air density up x2 and you feel your face, lungs, and brain collapsing in on itself, but no one else feels that way so you're just a fucking weirdo trying to play it cool even though you're collapsing inwards like a dying star"
Imminent death
"The way I've usually described it is a question of processing power, like in a computer.  All I know is that there are a bunch of things happening, and I can't keep track of them all, and I can't even tell which things are the things to worry about, and I'm getting further and further behind in my attention-paying, and it just spirals out of control.  When it gets bad enough, I start getting lightheaded and short of breath."
Higher heart rate and a lil sweat.
"Hmm it's like being strangled by a person who doesn't know how to finish sentences?

You can't breathe but you also end up not knowing the important thing the person is saying"
"Me feeling the whole world looking at me, critising me, pointing at me, laughing at me, sure that no matter what I do it will never be the best or the right thing to do, striving, trying so hard to to what  is the best for the people you love dearly but never feeling it's enough. That's just for starters."
I feel that everything and everyone around me sees straight through me and thinks nothing of me. And that they know I’m acting and that I don’t belong in whatever setting I’m in. That my mere existence in that space is an imposition on them and at any point in time I’m going to do that one thing too many and at any point they will finally cast me out and then I’ll be alone with nothing. Even more so than usual. And I think they’re right In thinking that. I also know it’s bullshit but it’s like I’ve got the angel and devil on my shoulder and the devil says all that and the angel says to ignore that fucker but the devil has a megaphone so I can only hear the angel if and when the devil decides not to say anything
To me it feels like a silly thing I should be able to take care of myself. I have social anxiety so I usually just hang in my apartment alone. But I can go out if there is a reason too. Lately the only reason would be to find a woman but I wouldn't be able to talk to her right away anyway so she would probably just walk away and that will be it.
My throat and chest feel tight my body gets real hot and face turns really red. Then I start sweating to the point where it looks like I was working out... sucks
"Unfortunately for me, I have heart issues that are currently being diagnosed. So when my heart does a weird pounding thing or feels like it stops and then pounds super hard and speeds up…..my brain immediately tells me I’m dying. If I’m alone, I have to call my sister and talk to her every single time it happens. If it’s bad enough, I have to stay on the phone with her until she gets to my house. Super annoying to me but I am extremely grateful that my sister understands and is ready to oblige."
Endless worries and planning along with multiple scenarios and assumptions before every step being taken. It slowly consumes you and leads to depression in my case.
"Trying to walk with people but you can't keep up, trying to talk but it's like you're invisible, like you've been hit by a car and your friends keep walking because they haven't noticed. 

You're the only one ""seeing the danger"" and it's everywhere."
"My anxiety manifests itself as a fluttering in my entire torso.   I wind up panting for breath, and sometimes get panicky.   I also startle really easily."
You know the feeling when you walk down stairs and then you take that one step that makes you feel like your falling off a cliff?
"I recently had an anxiety attack with a trigger of someone touching my eyes (a doctor), and it involved my normal tunnel vision, but it was my most severe one ever and I actually went full-on blind for a bit. (Didn’t know that was possible) Plus feeling like I couldn’t breathe and ringing ears. In general, I also have daily anxiety (not just attacks) that I’d summarize as having 24/7 pessimistic thoughts about every little thing that could possibly go wrong that others may not think about. For example, quadruple checking the stove’s off before I go out, or just deciding to not go out at all."
"Death. Like my body is shutting down and I am in the process of dying and very aware of my death. Vision and hearing going out, heart stopping, can’t breathe, going to pass out dizziness, total loss of control of my body. my life is ending. It’s terrifying. That is what an anxiety attack feels like to me anyway."
Like the countdown of the last 5 minutes of a test you’re only half way through.
Its like when you forget your license when driving but have to drive anyways. So you constantly feel like you're doing something wrong and or you're going to get in trouble. You're also unaware at all times where your license is so you have this feeling of always forgetting something important.
"Social anxiety (the one I feel most) is basically ""I'm gonna put all my feelings and thoughts in my bubble and deal with em myself the best I can and then I'm gonna die"""
It feels like a massive tidal wave is approaching you and you need to move. You know how to escape it but you cant its like your foot is stuck and the undercurrent is dragging you under as the wave gets closer and bigger and louder and it never hits it just keeps on coming
You have 45 seconds to figure it out yourself
My chest feels cavernous but also tight and heavy
"It feels like my brain isn’t working. I have enough of my own consciousness to be able to think partially rational but the other portion is not understanding, can’t focus, panicking, or utterly blank. The first time I actually understood my anxiety was after I went to the ER for what I thought were brain issues. I had no idea it was anxiety since for me, anxiety was either social anxiety or crying."
"To me a true anxiety attack is when everything is fine, and all of a sudden I feel this tightness forming in my chest as my brain tells me:  


""Welp, we've had a good run. You're about to die in five seconds. Don't you dare make a scene now.""  


And I usually find myself almost forgetting how to breathe for those few seconds or my heart has stopped and that I'm going to keel over to embrace oblivion at any second. Usually I have to sit up, move around, or otherwise jolt myself out of it with other stimuli. It was terrifying when it first happened to me when I was sitting in a classroom, I spent the few days after that in a heightened state of constant fear and worry that something was severely wrong with me. Sleep was impossible, immersing myself with hobbies was impossible, music did nothing, motivational and self-help videos were useless. Medication got it under control after a psychiatrist visit.  


Now I just don't fight it anymore and don't need medication. On the rare occasion it happens, I know what it is, I know fighting it is pointless, and usually that acceptance is what helps me get rid of it and keep it away for good."
I wish i could skip it
Always needing to do something you can’t do
Never ending jaws theme song
"Every time I think about the future I can see only the worst cas scenario, which, by the way, is the kind of thing that could be written into a dystopian future novel"
A terrible wave covering my whole body and then my brain needing to figure out why it’s happening so I can avoid the whole situation
Like your brain won’t stop going. To the point you feel like a computer with 137 windows open and all you want to do is know what time it is.
It feels like every problem you have is blown out of proportion and you obsess over it endlessly. Also a tight fluttery feeling in your chest that makes it worse.
"I'm very young and haven't been diagnosed, but it's gotten too much to brush off at this point. School, friendship issues, and recently having joined wrestling made me develop what I'm pretty sure is anxiety. 

To me it feels like a tangling tightness in my chest that surges in waves. It always gets worse right before I go to practice. Back when I first joined it was so bad I'd be hyperventilating in the locker room. When it comes up again, I breathe heavily and shake my hands a lot to ""shake it off."" Other times I get very still, and I've been zoning out more and more frequently. I'm a very emotional person, so usually I'd just cry it out if I felt bad, but with anxiety I can't just cry it out. It doesn't really come out in tears, but comes out in angrily snapping at loved ones, anxiety shits, biting my fingertips, and hearing but not really listening when someone else is talking. 

Wrestling practice itself has gotten easier to deal with but I know for myself that once the season starts, I'll likely have a whole new wave coming at me from all angles."
"Impending doom 24/7, stomach churning, feels like you’re going to go crazy or have a mental break down."
I have not heard this one before haha. This describes it perfectly :)
"I've never dealt with it until recently. This is a great analogy. I have anxiety from my ex. Everytime my phone buzzes or I see a email icon in my notifications I feel this. I'm waiting for divorce papers so I everytime the door bell rings I think it's divorce papers, which is inevitable. It's like living on pins and needles all the time, always on two chair legs just wishing to fall at least then I can get back up."
"I describe it similarly stating: ""You know that feeling in your chest when getting bad news? Imagine that sharp pain, but all the time."""
[deleted]
I'm in this comment and I don't like it
He absolutely said it best!!!
Thaas deep.
HOLY SHIT THATS ACCURATE
"> You know when you're sitting on a chair and you lean back so you're just on two legs

What does this mean?"
That’s pretty good
That's good. Really describes it well.
Very apt.
Loved him with Daniel Day-Lewis in Stars and Bars.
Thats so on point. Then at some point that feeling just starts to hurt
He was in my yard eating pasta salad the other day
this exactly
This feeling but I am walking down a busy street.
Tank!
I love this analogy
Couldn’t describe it better myself lol
It’s like a giant “oh sh-t” moment but you’re not really sure why..
"It's like playing a video game and you have to cross a narrow beam, or your character will die and lose minutes of your time and possibly other resources."
"Wow this is so it, 100%"
"My eyes get really blurry and everything becomes distant/I have to put in noise cancelling earphone as everything gets too loud. 

I feel this one a lot."
"Personally, I've had pressure/discomfort near my sternum (probably my diaphragm?) for over a decade, and I just realized within the past year that it was anxiety-induced."
"For me, It starts when my palms start to get sweaty. 
Next my knees will get weak, followed by my arms becoming heavy. If it’s bad enough there will be 
vomit on my sweater already, 
usually after I just ate mom's spaghetti.
I’m nervous but on the surface I look calm and ready."
This is sadly poetic. And I agree. *hugs*
"Go to a 3rd world country

Shit will cure your anxiety real quick. You will see some real shit"
"Hello internet stranger. I’ve been trying therapy for the first time in my life recently and something that stuck with me was labeling those negative thoughts. The label she mentioned seems kind of childish to me at first, but it’s helped me. 

She called it the “thought monster”

When I catch myself spiraling on negative thoughts, I try to remind myself that it’s likely just the thought monster. 

Doesn’t always work but hoping it may help you too!"
This exactly for me. Mixed with how we’ll fuckup by saying or doing something be it small or monstrous.
Imposter syndrome
"When my therapist first explained this reaction to me the first time, my mind was blown. (I get panic attacks frequently). I completely relate to this. I hope you have better days ahead :)"
"Noticing the physical responses to stress and anxiety was huge for me. I would literally high five myself every time I noticed lol. 

Do you find that noticing the physical responses helps you to calm down preemptively or does it maybe stress you out more?"
i've noticed that by extensively focusing and controlling on breathing I can mitigate a decent amount of the physical symptoms that I experience.
I am so glad that my anxiety doesn’t manifest in this way. Good luck stranger. :)
"I don’t have anxiety, but that happens when I do feel anxious."
Whenever I get anxious I always have to fart.... A lot.
Urgently
It doesn't make me poop but the medication sure does!
or spew
They find more and more connections between anxiety and stomach health every year
Best description on this thread.
This is extremely close to my definition.
"Even if the worst case scenario is a million to one, it’s basically going to happen when I’m feeling like that"
"Is this different than the normal physiological response to stress? I've never been diagnosed, but I've always felt like this in highly stressful situations. In the past two years they've become more intense, and coupling with my hands shaking more than they usually do (I've always had very slight tremors) and vision and hearing slightly fuzzing out. I attributed the newer symptoms to increased levels of stress and not taking as much care of my physical health as I used to. Some friends I talked to mentioned that these are some of the warning signs of panic or anxiety attacks. I always just assumed that this was how everyone felt during stressful situations. Is that not the case?"
I'm in this comment and I don't like it.
Damn I felt this
"That's a panick attack, OP is asking about living with constant anxiety."
"I really connect with this one. I am in university right now and I frequently go to the wrong building on campus/get lost as I am so in my mind. 

I also overshare to an extent I dislike. It’s like I am screaming at my brain to stop talking but I can’t.

I hope you eventually have better days :)"
This is the most accurate I've ever seen it be explained
My brain became a goldfish haha
Dissociation or just so much anxiety it feels unmanageable? No need to respond if you don’t want too. No pressure :)
[removed]
"Being always in fight or flight was how I described  to my boyfriend. People kept suggesting I should mediate, but I always to tense. I found progressive  muscle relaxation helps q bit, plus starting to take meds."
Lexapro is the only thing that ever relaxed me
Not being able to be in the present…….
I’ve only ever had a realy bad lot of anxiety maybe twice but it was the worst thing ever I just felt like everything was going to die if I didn’t make it home and I could do nothing to stop it
My fellow OCDer. You are not alone
That such a good way to put it “backed into a corner”. That’s exactly how I feel. Thank you for sharing. I hope you have better days ahead of you :)
This! It feels like I can’t fully breathe in!
"I agree, but not like your body is suffocating. It’s more like your mind or soul is suffocating."
"You are definitely not alone. I feel this the most in public situations or when having panic attacks. 

I have to constantly break down the thoughts and reevaluate what the “correct” decision is + deescalate negative ones at the same time.

I hope you have better days in front of you stranger :)"
This is a great description
Me too!
This is the one. Just adding fear of going insane along with the loss of control.
"I felt this one. When it gets really bad for me, I tend to not eat because of such. Hope you are doing well! :)"
I relate to you stranger so so so much. I hope for better days ahead :)
"Very accurate. I was about to post that it's like your adrenaline is stuck in the ""on"" position, and you're convinced that you'll collapse completely if you manage to switch it off, but I like your analogy better."
This one gave me chills. Thank you for sharing.
"Oh my gosh, this is perfect"
Thank you stranger :) good luck to you!
"Haha, perhaps I need to make a follow up asking for tips on how to manage such lmao."
It's just confusing me. I'm now guessing anxiety comes in many flavours.
"Hey, I feel this. I hope for better days ahead of you too :)"
You are definitely not alone in this feeling. You’ve managed to describe something I have trouble putting into words. The intense fear and infinite thoughts that break you down to a primal level. It’s terrifying. I hope you have better days ahead stranger :)
"Simple, yet effective."
"Yes, god, I feel this completely. I hope for better days ahead stranger."
Do you have advice for this? I’m really struggling with it lately. No need to respond :)
"Hey there. If you would like to talk to reach out and message me about anything, feel free too. Maybe this isn’t serious or you don’t think it is. However, I am just letting you know you have an option with no judgement.  

I’m so sorry you’re going through this and I hope this feeling passes."
"Lol I misread your username as Sweaty_Duck and I thought, yep, relatable.

But yeah, I always joke that I don't need to heat my flat when I can always just overreact to something..."
"Oh shit, I hope you are doing better now!"
"Why is this actually how it feels like? Haha, I struggle with panic attacks and this perfect describes the moments leading up to it.

Hope you are doing well stranger :)"
"I hope you have better days ahead of you too stranger :) 

I am also in a bit of a low-point anxiety wise right now and I can relate. I hope you know you are not alone."
It feels like grass sliding between my ass crack; only to find out it's a worm.
"Hi, are you okay and need to talk about it? I am open to messaging and there would be 100% no judgement. 

You are not alone."
"Oh god, that actually gave me chills and I am not male. Go into poetry or something idk."
"God, I had a panic attack like this a few days ago. I couldn’t move my eyes because I thought said movement would put me in danger. Normally I am at least able to move a little. It was terrifying. Thank you for sharing. You are most definitely not alone. Hope you have better days ahead :)

(Also, no pressure, but what works best for you in those moments? Any advice would be appreciated)"
"Lucky bastard haha 

In all seriousness, I hope you continue having good days!"
What is an “anxiety stay”? I’ve never heard some use that before :) No pressure to respond.
I’m the total opposite. Mental anxiety sucks worse than physical tbh

Watch his standup. It's not for everyone but many consider him one of the greatest of all time
"Change your ringtone, text sounds, you can also change the vibration type. Turn off badges, notifications, change email settings. Your brain will feel better."
Tea always helps!
"There's a surge of adrenaline coupled with an existential fear like when you almost fall off a cliff. For most people, that's a healthy reaction as it preps all of your systems for flight or fight. It's scary for a split second and then it's over.

With anxiety disorder, it literally never goes away. The constant adrenaline is just like a poison coursing through your system."
You’re about to tip over. So that fear
I was out of raisinets but he didn't seem upset.
To drop boms? But I keep on forgetting what I..
Ty 😊
"People with Anxiety (particularly, severe anxiety) aren't generally interested in going ... anywhere really."
I fucking live in one.
It comes on at night while sleeping. It feels like everyone blames you for things and they look down on you like your worthless
"Maybe a little, but there are times (like at a doctor's appointment) where I'm sort of in denial and thinking 'mentally I'm okay, why is my body freaking out?!?' which then sends me into a more intense panic. 

But yeah if I'm at work or somewhere random and I start noticing signs then I'll start combatting it with tips from my therapist and usually can cool down pretty fast.

Edit: TIPPs (temperature, intense excersize, paced breathing, paired muscle relaxation) and figure 8 breathing are my go-to methods mostly. If I'm heading in to a situation I know I might get anxious, I do ""self touch"" or at least a shortened version of only touching my face. starting at the forehead gently pressing fingers on it 3x and then working down the face, while reasoning with myself about the situation."
same! i will dry heave when very anxious. and there are times where my body is going through it and i realize so i try to do grounding exercises and remind my body that there is no need to freak out.
You're like that dude on the radio.  Jeffrey from Rovers Morning Glory.  Everytime he gets nervous he farts..  didn't know this was a thing.  Thought this was just for the show.
"Anxiety symptoms vary in intensity, from mild to severe. Panic attacks appear suddenly, while anxiety symptoms become gradually more intense over minutes, hours, or days. Panic attacks usually subside after a few minutes, while anxiety symptoms can prevail for long periods.
What I said was a valid anxiety response"
"I mean, it’s whatever people want to share honestly :)"
"Yeah, having panic attacks is part of living with constant anxiety."
Over sharing is a good way to put it. I will have a random conversation and then I see the look on the persons face I’m talking too. I immediately think “You did it again”.
I hope you have better days too. One day at a time. You've got this!
i hope you have better days too!! this sounds like adhd symptoms i have when i’m all over the place 🙈
I have had that. I worry about over sharing *to my wife* when she asks me about a subject she knows I love.
A little bit of both tbh. My body just starts to feel unreal and then I dissociate and it’s unmanageable
Like the feeling you get when you're in a dream and you realize it's a dream and that nothing is real?
"Yes, always worrying about tomorrow while your losing today"
"Same. Even the thought of food just makes my stomach turn. 

I'm doing okay at the moment, thank you. I hope the same for yourself!"
"Thank you, I hope the same for you ❤"
You too ❤️ I'm glad to know I'm not alone in the feelings
"Therapy and medication helps a lot. It gives you to tools to work through it. It won’t always work but there are times it does so that’s a good thing.
One tool is 5 things. You start off by saying I THINK I feel anxious. Not I am anxious. It takes the power back.

Then close your eyes and -5 things you can hear.
5 things you can see
5 things you can feel ( this needs to be physical- your sweater. The floor. Wind on your skin)

Grounding won’t always work. I also have a rainbow alpaca toy it’s not big but I hold that too to look at the colours, feel the fluff and so on.

Anxiety is very hard to live with if you don’t get help.
And it will get worse if you don’t actively get some help in some way if you don’t have the tools to navigate it.

On days when the colours fade and your body says no- make sure you’re kicking positive mode in.
Ok so the colours are dull- they will come back.
Ok body, I can sense you’re about to feel overwhelmed I am aware. But then keep doing what you were doing.

On days where you can’t- go back to laying down, Have a shower, maybe do some yoga ( just some light movement so your body realises that you want to keep the power- not handing it to anxiety)

And days when you can’t even get out of bed- be kind to yourself. 
Keep self talk positive. If you can manage to sit in the sun for 15 mins on these days- it does wonders too.

I hope something here will help you. But if you’re not seeing a dr, please make sure you do."
"Well hope you are at the pinkest of your health too. Just remember, no matter what, we always have a way out of struggle"
Thank you so much. Same to you :)
"Hi, I am okay! Didn’t mean to scare anybody, my brain just says that when I’m not okay sometimes."
"It’s less than a panic attack, but heavier than “regular anxiety” it’s very unfortunate when it starts and you don’t recognize it, because it can quickly ruin your day with depression. When you recognize it, it’s best to use your closest “person” as a jacket. Lol. No. Not as a skin lover (Reddit smartasses) but as close shelter for the day to keep you in your lane."
"> Butterflies in my stomach, except they're not good. They're bad.

Hornets?"
*This* is the bad place!
"This is essentially how it feels for me too. I tend to have bad relationship anxiety and obsessive-compulsive tendencies and so I start catastrophisizing.  I get an awful buzzing feeling in my core, cannot sleep or concentrate on anything else. It also tends to suck the energy out of me and I am just absolutely exhausted. When I feel this way I want to just go to sleep but I often can't. Therapy and learning how to regulate your emotions really helps with it though and it's not as bad as it used to be."
I agree with your explaination but I also want to add to that. It's that point where you have so much excitement but you don't know whether it will be good or bad. It's like a fight or flight mode but that emotion has nowhere to go and just hangs there.
This is exactly how mine feels.
Who's standup?
But if you lean back how are you on two legs?
"He rarely is upset I think, largely just wondering"
"Yeah, this person hasn't experienced what I'm talking about, they'll never understand."
Share those tips please & Yes you feel more panic when you feel the random body aches and you are like something is going to happen but nothing happens. Everything just settles down after a bit.
Yes please share your tips for combatting physical symptoms!
Few minutes?  Lol I wish.
"Nope, two completely different things with their own spectrum of symptoms. Don't take my word for it though, Look it up."
Yes! The instant shift in body language or facial expression that sets fire alarms off in my head!
You too!
Thanks stranger! I’m trying my best today but tomorrow’s looking hopeful!
"You too! Thanks for the advice, I hope you take it to heart as well. (As sometimes I can give advice but struggle to feel it myself)."
Totally understand :)
Omg this is it.
Possibly moms spaghetti?
I remember when I got my first panic attack at around 18. I didn’t know what was happening so I jumped up and started to run but I didn’t know where to run so I sat back down and just shook. Strange times. At least I knew what it was the next time it happened.
"The guy on the couch.

-sincerely, 
The guy on the couch"
"The office chair I have has 3 legs. Tip over a bit and you can be on only 2, 1 is in the air and you are about to fall over. Don’t read too much too the specifics it’s just basically saying you’re about to fall over. That’s what anxiety feels like."
back 2 chair legs. not your legs
"The chair is on two legs. After being tipped backwards with the person sitting in it, the 2 front chair legs would be in the air, with the back two on the ground."
I hope (as I'm sure you do as well) they never will.
What did you experience? The feeling of getting nervous? Thousands of people have gotten nervous. That is nothing new.
My point is panic attacks are usually shorter than anxiety attacks. And with my original comment I never said how long it lasts for me and that what I said was valid for anxiety
I live with both of them 🤷‍♀️
"Me too, me too mama"
"I agree. I don't wish ill on people. 

Sometimes I wish they could experience an hour of the things I do with this brain but I don't wish them permanent harm."
You obviously have no idea what you're talking about.
You don't. Nothing new and nothing special.
"Constantly being in fear. 

Afraid that the person I’m talking to thinks that I’m weird or stupid, or whatever I’m saying is weird or stupid. And that makes the words come out weird. 

Not being able to go anywhere or just walk around in public without knowing that everyone is watching the way you’re walking or looking at things. Maybe they think you’re stealing. Maybe they think you’re lost. Maybe they think you’re just stupid.

And then you finally get to go home and be alone. In your own safe space. Left alone to think about all the ways you were weird today, and think about all wrong things that you said and did. "
"I LOVE being around people and having a good time.

I HATE convincing myself to be around people.

You know how you have to convince yourself to go to the gym or get out of bed? Imagine that... but every time you go out in public."
"You see friendly looking people, you want to be their friends but you can't look at them without feeling uneasy.

You are reluctant to speak to people, even if you have something in my mind. Because, for some reason, you are afraid of saying something stupid.

You can't make friends and you feel super lonely which boosts SA even more.

You are crushing on that girl for 3 years, it's killing you but you will seek for 1001 stupid reasons not to ask her out.
Let's not forget how nervous you feel next to her. 

You may be suspicious that people/friends hate you for some very random reason, usually made up by your own mind.

You feel uneasy when people look at you or walking on the street, or in a crowd.

People invite you somewhere. At first, you feel like going, but anxiety kicks in and you turn the request down. Nobody ever invites you anymore, that makes you depressed and more anxious. 


I could keep on this forever.... "
"Do these people *actually* like being around me, or do they pretend because they pity me?

It’s a constant dread that leaves me questioning every. Little. Thing. Everything I do, I say, they do, they say.  

It’s not even based in logic.  I *know* that these people like being around me.  I *know* that if they didn’t like me, they would leave me alone.  I *know* that I am likable and that people want to know me. 

But *what if I’m wrong* is always there.  Creeping.  Watching. Staring.  Waiting for that one sliver of a clue to pounce. "
"I want to go to parties, for example, but if I go I am instantly sorry I did,   I stand there, feeling grossly conspicuous, awkward, out of place, self-conscious, and trying not to make eye contact.  I just want to leave as soon as a decent interval has passed so the host will not think I am being rude.  I hide in the bathroom or try to be invisible.  It's so painful!"
"I can’t talk correctly. I can’t seem to get words out without messing up. I feel like people are judging me constantly. I talk to people and I think I give people weird energy just because I never know what to say. I can respond I just usually keep to myself. It’s hard to make friends, but I want friends. I only know people through people. It’s hard being afraid. I want to escape my head sometimes. "
"Let's say you have a singular friend who is super popular.

Said friend is always surrounded by a bunch of people.

You feel 'wrong' or 'awkward' in interrupting that group of friends to talk to your one friend and feel like you don't belong there.

Interacting with groups of people just 'feels' wrong."
"A never-ending mental list of ""What-if""s"
"It can be really hard to explain as there's so much to do with social anxiety that can get lost in simple words - however my experience with it is feeling extremely uncomfortable in any conversation, which can translate into both awkward and seemingly unfriendly behaviour.    
Your brain doesn't work the same way as it does when you're relaxed - I know that my thinking goes out of whack when anxiety comes into the picture, and contribute to making weird/stupid/crazy choices which you later look back on and wonder why the hell you did that.  
On very rare occasions when the stars have aligned, I've had amazing conversations that had flow and a natural, enjoyable feel to them.  
With social anxiety, that flow isn't there. Every choice you make is a 'manual' choice - maybe forced is a better word but it's not something I can always control, and trying to control it only makes it worse.  
With all of this, people tend to notice your behavior and react badly to it, which further reinforces and increases the anxiety.  
 
Simply put, it makes *everything* harder. Imagine reaching for your drink and taking a sip. Easy, right? Nope! If you're feeling some anxiety at that moment, it's near impossible to do it comfortably or in a natural, relaxed way.  
Some nights I try to relax myself but I get distracted within 10 seconds, soon finding myself tense again.  
And the dating world? That's hard for most people. Try having social anxiety thrown into that and see how much it throws things off.  
  
To end this description, the most frustrating thing is that you might know who you are and what you are capable of in your natural mindset. Anxiety is like locking that in a dark, cold room where you only have space to stand. The oxygen isn't quite enough in there, and you can't quite get warm enough. The pressure of the air is oppressive, and the smell of it is more stale than you would expect.  
Outside of that room is where everyone else is, and they can't quite hear you. You can't quite communicate what you want to say to them.  
And getting frustrated at it only makes it worse."
"The past is regret, the future is dread and so you spin in place, or maybe more appropriately, you spiral.  All of life's a stage, as Shakespeare says, you have stage fright, you're fucking up your lines and everyone's staring.

Reaching out to people is as hard as taking all the worst qualities in yourself that you're so intimately familiar with and putting them front and center.  You can try to tell yourself that they don't see *this* or they don't know about *that*, but when it feels like you walk away from every single conversation having put your foot in your mouth or screwed up somehow, bolstered by the fact that sometimes or oftentimes you *do* put your foot in your mouth, it's hard to convince yourself people don't see it.  It's easier to avoid people, but if you avoid people your social skills wane, which makes it easier to fuck up or make a bad impression.  It makes it harder to reach out.  If you *don't* avoid people then you keep putting your foot in your mouth or take a swing at joining the conversation and completely, utterly miss- being acutely aware of the silence that follows.  And you keep being weirdly sweaty or stammery, or you keep lingering at the edge of the conversation with a keen and all-consuming awareness of how your clothes aren't sitting right on your body and... what are you even doing with your hands?  What are you supposed to do?  Does your hair look stupid?  Of course it looks stupid, it always looks stupid.  You endure any and all social interactions until they're over.  And then?  Great, you socialized, you went to school or went to work and congratulations, you got nothing except weird looks and uncomfortable laughter, and now you have three more things in that mental catalogue of things to look back on and cringe about.  Now do it tomorrow- decide if you're going to socialize or not.  To retain any sanity, you're going to choose *not* eventually.  

And you lose those connections, or connections disappear because each phase of people's lives naturally sees them lose one or two people... and then you don't have people to anchor or ground your perspective or pull you out of your spin-in-place state of being.

And in the midst of it all, spinning in place, nothing to anchor you, your perspective gradually warps further and further.  You have no frame of reference except your own thoughts and your immediate experience, a catalogue of all the times you did something absolutely cringeworthy, and a future looming before you which is just more social fuckups waiting to happen.  You spin in place where you are, the clocks ticking down where you're not married or employed and you're that girl or that guy that isn't doing anything with their lives.  ...And if that's where you're at, then it makes social interactions that much harder, because most conversations among adults start with 'what do you do?'  This warping of perspective alters *everything,* from how others look at you to the difficulty of applying to a better job.

You get really, really good at coming up with ways to second guess everything, because if you don't, then you do stuff you cringe about, or you go into situations unprepared and balls them up.  The issue with second guessing everything, though, is that you second guess *everything*.  And the people who still interact with you don't necessarily help, because when they see you have difficulty and reach out, their solutions are to tell you that you're doing X wrong, you're wearing the wrong shoes, you need a haircut, you need to think about your career, you need to get married soon or you'll miss your chance to have kids.  Pressure, pressure, more expectations, more judgments.

And you're out of shape, right?  Because every time you go to class or to work, legging it across campus and up the flights of stairs, your heart is pounding, you can't think straight, you can't regulate your breathing, and you're very conscious of that breathing, of course, because you're hyperconscious of every detail of yourself that people might criticize.  And that's the norm... until the day you have an appointment early in the same area... you make it to school or work early after the appointment, you sit, and you have an extra half hour to review and take it easy.  And as you sit at your desk and get within the ten or five minutes of your day starting and people arriving, your heart pounds, you can't think straight, you can't regulate your breathing.

You realize how bad things are, that you're having minor panic attacks or that you have to work to convince yourself that someone laughing on the far side of the street isn't because they're laughing at you (their backs are to you, how could they be laughing at you if they aren't even looking your way?) but you have to work to convince yourself all the same.  Yet when it comes time to pick up the phone and call someone for help... you second guess.  You're supposed to approach someone and *all* of this is in play.  Every flaw of yourself you're aware of, the dread, the regret, the panicky feeling.  You have to find the right someone and figure out payment and figure out routine, then take this huge ball of things you can't even wrap your head around and you're... you're really tired.  It's exhausting to deal with all of this, consider it all, and do as much as you're doing.  So you don't make the call, and it continues, and you spiral further down."
"At the risk of sounding like an emo teen, it makes you feel misunderstood and alienated"
"You’re talking to someone but you’re so worried about what they think of you that you end up talking shit and looking nervous and you don’t connect with them. You have interests and passions and interesting things to say, all of which you’ll never say for fear of being strange or obnoxious for talking about yourself. You microanalyse everyone’s facial expression to determine whether they think you’re a freak. Stuff like that."
Increased heart rate when i have to call someone.
"Sometimes it feels like you're out of place. Like you missed the last stop on the train station to normality.

 Everyone else is there but you're stuck on a cold platform, with nothing but the rain to keep you company.

Other times it feels like you're centre stage, everyone's scrutinising you, waiting for you to slip up and reveal you're not one of them.

And again, other times your heart races so fast you feel you could die, it's impossible that no one has noticed and yet they're just continuing their conversations, ignoring the terror you're experiencing. You don't know if it would be better or worse for them to acknowledge it.

Sometimes it feels like if you could just find the right words and string them into the right order you could explain it well enough that someone could help you. It's like a word on the tip of your tongue that you just can't find. "
You know that feeling when you are going down stairs and miss one?  That all day.
"social anxiety is constantly being paranoid and on edge when you’re out of the house, even if it’s just to go to the store. 

its being too anxious to ask for water at someone’s house so you go into the bathroom and drink out of the sink faucet. 

it’s keeping trash on you for 45 minutes because you’re too nervous to get up and walk across the room and throw it away. 

it’s the inability to look a person in the eye when talking to them.

it’s stressing out over plans that are 3 months away

it’s assuming that every time you walk past laughing strangers, they’re laughing at you

it’s overpacking your bag just to run errands, because the feeling of having *something* under your control relieves a little bit of the anxiety 

it’s having anxiety attacks in the bathroom and then pretending like nothing happened 20 minutes later because you’re too nervous to admit anything happened 

it’s sitting in the back of the classroom praying to god you won’t get called on to answer a question out loud to the class"
"You're at your locker after class and putting a few books in. You see a girl you know walking in your direction, you're genuinely concerned or interested in something she's wearing so you think of a conversation to say but you're scared you'll seem like a creep and that she'll get a megaphone and yell ""GET AWAY!, CREEP!"" so you don't - but then you remember you read that article about how chances are that's not going to happen - but now she's closer and you haven't managed to think of what to say to her to talk to her, she's closer and closer and your heart is pacing, so you just turn in the opposite direction and walk away. You were so flustered in that little situation that you completely forgot to close your locker and you're sweating. 

It feels annoying and repetitive - so much so that I literally said fuck this (over the span of a few years of course) to the point where now in college I just say fuck it and stay quiet. 

In my experience, a lot of people who have overcome their social anxiety have done so by opting to just mind their own business than to go ahead and have a conversation. This doesn't mean they can't uphold a conversation, it just means that while time has ""healed"" their anxiety, it made them a more quiet person simply because of preference of avoiding it all together (at-least for my group of friends)."
"You want to be able to relax with others. Have fun, talk, tell jokes. But it holds you back. You tell yourself your going to talk but you don’t. You want to say something but you end up being quite. So later you kick yourself because someone else said the exact thing you would have said. People think you don’t like talking to them or just don’t want to hang around them. Your considered either not friendly or odd. But it’s just hard for you to share or talk. And when you do talk you stutter, mispronounce words or end up repeating yourself because they can’t hear what you said. Everything you want to say or will say is being analyzed by you in advanced as your talking to someone just in hopes of saying it right. Even if it’s just a chat with your coworker. And then hope it doesn’t last too long and when it’s a bit long. You hope it doesn’t get awkward or hope to find a good stopping point.

Then crowds it’s just a bit hard. You think people are staring at you so you start to fidget. Let’s set the place: the bank. Your waiting in line and then you start to feel self conscious. You feel eyes staring at you. You start sweating and now you feel even more uncomfortable. But you can’t leave cause then they’ll notice that too. So your stuck in this limbo until you can  cash your check and get out. But you have to wait and that feels like an eternity. 

Sometimes it’s alright and then other days you feel like your being stared at and you can’t do anything and you feel not in-control. There are others who don’t know you have anxiety and will understand, while others will not. And then their are people you know, friends, family, SO’s and they understand. But at times they’ll get frustrated with you. Then it hurts because you felt  that they understood. But they got frustrated with you and you now feel like a burden.

You can’t shake anxiety off, it’s something that clings to you. And you just wish you could go out and not have to worry about simply standing in a room with other people or just chit chatting. It sucks and telling them is difficult. Cause who says “I have anxiety” cause you sound like people who casually say I have OCD. But in reality they don’t. "
Exhausting and deeply frustrating. 
I wrote a long response but it was to dumb to share and I don't want to be wrong. 
"when you make a social boo boo, and you’re still kicking yourself about it 6 months later"
"My social anxiety seems to be the result of a lack of self esteem. 

Somehow I’ve got my wires crossed and i consider the outcome of everyday social situations to be highly important. This means if I feel I may be heading towards a social interaction I feel I’m unequipped to handle perfectly, I feel a large amount of nervousness beforehand and during. If I realise I’m going to be showing a new person around at work, it feels like a punch in the gut, as I anticipate the awkward situation where I don’t know what I’m doing. I become stressed rather quickly, and this will make it harder to perform well socially, which in turn will make me more anxious up until the point where I may have to leave.

My theory on social anxiety (mine at least), is that I have low self value, due to childhood bullying and the like. On some level this causes me to feel I’m worth far less to other people than I actually am, which makes me fear social interactions wherein I make myself look bad, as I assume I’m on some kind of thin ice socially as it is. 

This makes sense as we are a highly social species, and ostracism from the collective has been a death sentence for many. It would make sense from a tribal perspective to view social failure as very important, if you feel you are worth so little that it may cause people to reject you."
"Most of the time I feel on edge and get exhausted easily. During bad moments I get a feeling of dread, my gut doesn't feel right, everything is loud, hard time breathing, my mind goes blank. If I cannot remove myself from the situation or keep myself calm then I will probably start hyperventilating and crying. Luckily that last part is rare."
"this ones been tossed around before but it’s exactly like when there’s intense battle music playing but you can’t find any of the enemy’s in a video game.

it’s hard to even do simple things like ordering fast food because it requires me to talk to someone.

just going outside is enough to do me over sometimes, if there too many people around my heads gonna start feeling tense and i’m desperately gonna try not to panic.

it takes me a few days to work myself up to messaging people online.

god forbid i want connect with someone and go out with them because that just doesn’t happen since i’m too afraid to even say hello to anyone, the isolation and loneliness this causes just fucking rots me from the inside out because all i want is something as simple as hug from someone. 

the constant feeling of being on edge while at school is frustrating and affects my grades and performance.

i physically cannot bring myself to make eye contact with another person and if i do it feels like a jump scare.

all of a sudden not being able to go to the toilet in public because someone just walked into the stall next to you.

those endless nights where i can’t sleep because i’m literally over analysing every conversation i had with people, sometimes that can spiral into a full blown panic attack.


i could go on for hours, it’s like a living hell.

It sucks ass. It’s ruining my life and I just want it to go away.
Imagine writing a comment on reddit only to delete it before post because you feel like nobody cares. 
"Social anxiety is deleting and retyping your reply to this thread multiple times because you want your response to sound perfect so no one makes fun of you or berates you for your response, only to settle for something subpar because you feel the need to get SOMETHING out there and regretting it the minute you press Send. "
Feels bad man.
Anxious is my guess
"Like there's too many people, oh god why is this mall so crowded on Friday at 11am? Don't you people have jobs? Please give me my personal space, I just wanted to look at scented candles, why does everyone in the store want to look at the stuff directly near me?"
Like you're trying to prepare yourself for someone/something to jump out and randomly attack you at any given time.
"I had severe social anxiety from like 2008-2016 and only left my house a handful of times during those years. I would get really bad anxiety just standing near a window inside the house or opening the door to get the mail. Basically anything that had the potential for someone to see me and interact with me in any way. There isn't really a rational reasoning to it because it's by definition an irrational fear. I had no problem going in my back yard because it was completely fenced it. To answer your question of how it felt my heart would start racing, I'd feel like a knot in my gut, I'd be like hyper alert. It sucked a lot. I'm doing better now though."
"Hey remember that one minor dumb thing you did 4 years ago that person A probably forgot about after 10 mins? Well now you’re talking to Person A and they think you’re a moron now, you dumb piece of shit. 

Oh, did you stutter when saying hi to Person B. You will forever be judged for that you dumb piece of shit. Now think about that every time you talk with Person B and be socially awkward. 

Every tiny mistake is magnified, every actual mistake makes me feel more justified in magnifying the smaller mistakes which makes it more likely to make mistakes. Vicious cycle. "
Going to great lengths to avoid interaction — like the time I hid in the bushes as my housemates came into the backyard where I was. They didn’t see me and I had to stay in those bushes for their whole barbecue :-( As soon as 10 minutes had passed I realized they weren’t leaving and that I had just forced my own hand 
"feeling like everyone will take note of everything you do/pass judgment, even though logically you know no one cares"
"* My greatest fear is having to spend time with anyone outside of a group setting, I just feel like I don't know how to interact with someone one on one.

* I have never tried to sing in my life, because I feel like it is a very embarrassing thing to do and when I have found myself in group situations where others are singing I have felt very uncomfortable.

* Similarly, I feel the same way about cheering/shouting/hollering, for example when groups of people are drunk and/or partying, people often holler/make loud noises for some reason; I can't bring myself to do that without dying of embarrassment, and I even feel embarrassed for those that do it.

* Many times when I have to interact with a stranger, even if it is a cashier or waitress at a restaurant and they try to have a conversation with me, my adrenaline spikes and my hands shake uncontrollably.

* I used to have a very hard time speaking on the phone. If I absolutely had to call someone, I had to script out what I needed to say on paper for about 30 minutes before hand, and try to calm my nerves before dialing the number. I would never answer the phone. Today, I think I can handle it better, but I still hate talking on the phone and I haven't even owned a cellphone for about 4 years.

* I have a hard time speaking to people in general. I think the last actual conversation I had was a month and a half ago. If I am anxious, which I generally am, I tend to trip over my words a lot and I am unable to think clearly. I typically don't engage in conversation unless someone talks to me first, which is practically never.

* The only times that I have been able to carry on a conversation without feeling anxious, nervous, embarrassed or uneasy was when I was high on various illegal drugs, which I don't do anymore and never did very often."
Lonely.
Life is overly challenging when you fear your own species.
"Exhausting. And insidious. I never realized how much social anxiety influenced so many of my decisions. 

I've been getting help for it over the past couple of years but it's hard for me to unlearn something/change a behaviour that's been ingrained in me since childhood. The process is slow with some victories and a lot of setbacks. It's a fight multiple times a day, every day. 

Some examples of the way I think and behave: I want to buy a pair of sunglasses just so I don't have to make accidental eye contact with people. I'll cross the street to avoid walking past someone walking towards me. Sometimes I'll be able to handle making a two-minute phone-call but most times I have to psych myself up, write down a script of what I need to say, chew gum or drink water because my mouth has gone dry, practice my voice so it sounds calm and regulated rather than fast and high-quality pitched as it gets when I'm nervous. I get tense when the phone or doorbell rings and won't answer the phone even if I know who's calling -- I'll just let it go to voicemail. I calculate when and where I go shopping so I can avoid crowds, noise, and too much stimuli (a recipe for a panic attack). I would love to join meetup groups or dating apps but I feel a weird combination of terror and embarrassment. And so on. 

There's a constant feeling like a thick knot in my chest. I wish I could just turn off my brain so I didn't have to deal with all the ridiculous noise it creates. I wish I wasn't like this."
"This will probably be buried, but you know that sinking feeling in your stomach when you tap your pocket and your wallet/phone/keys aren't there? 

Social anxiety is that feeling every time you walk into a room with people. "
"Every time I know I'm going to have to talk to someone I don't know, be around a group I don't feel comfortable with, or get a phone call, my throat closes up. My back gets hot. 
Also, if I'm out in public for too long, I feel shaky, my skin tingles, and my ears ring. 
I don't like playing MMOs because I always start to feel scared or nervous. "
"Like your being recorded in all you say, and everyone can feel the fear radiating off you. Like how you feel in the dark after seeing a horror movie really, except you know these people and that they wouldn’t be judging you but what if thEY ARE? "
"Social anxiety for me is a gut gripping, looming presence that affects me physically. It ranges from increased heart rate and shallow breathing to complete loss of motor functions.

I have failed job interviews because I've been frozen in fear. I've been brought to tears by having to walk past people on the sidewalk.

Even with good friends, I'm a wreck. I'm too uncomfortable to speak, so I spend most my time sitting quietly, even with my best friend. I hate making plans to meet with people because the time leading up to it, sometimes up to 3 days before, I get so anxious that I can barely sleep. But I hate not having friends or spending time with them.

I can't maintain eye contact, it almost hurts to try. Forcing myself will make me cry.

This is mostly solved by interacting with people online, where they can't see me and I can't see them. I still feel some anxiety with it though. I must be able to control how much of me is perceived though, push to talk or mute is a must."
"For me the most accurate description i Can Think of is this:

Imaging you are in a room with other people, lets say a general meeting. People are kind, you know some a bit but not really. There is food for you, sandwiches and fruits, for the members of the meeting to take.

Then, you get hungry. You know you could take the food, that technically its there for you to eat. But so far noone has taken something *maybe its too early to already eat*? Then, finally someone gets up and takes an apple. Alright, you think, guess its free to take. But wait!, you dont want to go too quickly or they will know you only waited for someone to make the first move. So wait a few more minutes, then go.

 You dont really want an apple, but since the guy before you took one, you get one too.  Constantly thinking people think you are weird, or rude for eating their food.

But you eat the apple, until only the stem is left. Gotta throw that one away, but if you stand up now, people will think bad of you for always interrupting the one speaking. So you keep it, wait to see what others do with their trash. Same play as with taking the food, but maybe you also decide its not worth the risk to stand up, so you keep the stem and take it with you to throw it away at home, where noone is watching.

Got kinda long but thats how its like for me."
"Well, it's like...I don't really...I mean it's kind of like there are times where I feel...and I'm not sure about...but those times are kinda of like all the times... or something like that. I'm sure I don't really know. I mean, it's what my therap...oh but that's nothing. I'm just not really sure what to do or say or whatever. You don't need to...it's not like a big deal. I'll just...okay. Yeah. A-Alright. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I don't...sorry. Sorry about that. I'm just kinda sorry."
There's a constant meta-awareness hovering over you which doubts and fears every word that comes out of your mouth. It stops you from reading the flow and mood of the conversation because it is the foremost thing in your mind. You can't pay close attention to anything else. In some instances you just shut off completely and go numb/silent.
"You feel like everyone is looking at you, thinking your weird, talking bad about you. You feel like you seem stupid. You stumble your words, forget what you were saying. You feel like your gonna throw up, pass out, have a heart attack etc just to even go into public or have a simple interaction with some one. Etc aka HELL"
"I don't know if that's called Social Anxiety but I often feel like the useless guy in the group, just being dragged on, not really being useful or even included as others often adress each other and I'm just following ; I'm just there, uneasy - sometimes wondering if I'm a buffoon the rare times I open my mouth to say something. 
Also, I tend to think (and I believe it) that I'd be better on my phone than with these guys (not trying to belittle them, it's just my feeling). It has to do with the fact that I have trouble talking with others of my hobbies (that are not really that special in reality). Also I get the feeling that if others don't share my passions, I can't really get along with them. "
"Like you're on The Truman show and fucking up everything, everyone's watching and laughing at you not with you and it's just searing into your soul."
"Last week I was locked out of my house. The neighbors have a spare key, and they were home, but instead I waited 3 hours for my wife to come home and let me in."
Like trying to take a deep breath through a crazy straw while an elephant sits on your chest and tells you why nobody likes you.
"You know when you're leaning back on a chair, and there's that moment where you feel like you're going to fall back and you can't help it, and your heart jumps into your mouth? It's like feeling like that, but every moment you're awake. "
"When you have to throw something out but nobody else does so you just wait there with trash in hand and wait until someone throws out something as well because you think that people are going to judge you for throwing out garbage at the wrong time.

"About age 20-22 I never left my house because of my social anxiety. I felt like everyone was judging me. I felt like every time someone laughed in public it was directed at me. 

It made me overthink every time I had to go outside and talk to people. I'd rehearse scripts in my head about what I was gonna say etc. I had to have every little detail planned out, from the inflection of my voice to how I was going to walk. This overthinking basically became exhausting and became even more of a barrier to me going outside.

"I saw a great shirt recently that said ""Walk up in the club like what up! I got social anxiety and I want to go home"". And it was painfully accurate.  

You live your life assuming the worst case scenario. Everyone is judging you, and everything that can go wrong will. And so it takes a ton of effort to go up and talk to that person at the party, or to call them up after you've talked all night. You just figure you annoy everyone, so might as well save yourself the humiliation and just stay in."
"Imagine feeling like everything that you do is being constantly analyzed and you are somehow fucking it up, but your not sure exactly how."
"I had to call in sick to work once because the idea of working with a new manager who didn't like me much put me into full blown panic. My heart beat sped up, I felt hot all over and couldn't sleep. I'm also a very very short person and tend to feel like a can't breath when in crowds (especially crowded trains). All those people towering over me, breathing on me... It's awful"
"Hard to explain, but ill try to explain mine.

The second I step outside, it is constant questions in my head, and warning signs of "" Oh dont do that, you look weird "" or "" Be sure to think VERY HARD about how you are walking "" or "" Hey, this person is nice. Be a shame if they saw your fucked up eyebrows "". Like a constant nagging feeling of "" You're fucking this up, they're gonna hate you now """

"Imagine having a brief conversation with someone that they won’t even remember by tomorrow and then going home only to think if you said something wrong, messed up a word, or did something embarrassing. It sucks.."
"It feels like you're missing something. You try to have a pleasant conversation, make casual eye contact, crack a joke, flirt with attractive people, all the things you see ""normal"" people do. But you always fall flat.

Fear is behind every action. And people can feel it. And you can feel their feeling. There is a screen between you and the rest of the world. Every thought, every move, every word is questioned.

You try to fight it, approach social situations from different angles, drop-out, quit, move, reinvent yourself. You keep chasing normalcy because of the rare moments where you do break through and you glimpse what life could be without anxiety, what life must be like for everyone else. It's intoxicating, impossibly easy, perfectly comfortable.

But the fear follows. One misstep and a tornado of self doubt descends.

I'm still hopeful I can shake my anxiety, but it's hard. I don't have close friends, I've only been in three brief relationships (which fell apart because I lacked confidence), and I've never been able to enjoy celebrations or large gatherings. I'm luckier than many because I enjoy professional success, but my personal life feels like an unbeatable game, and sometimes I get tired of playing."
"It can be a bit of a struggle but for the past few months, I have been trying to be more outgoing and more social. Unfortunately I haven’t made any new friends. I won’t give up. I’ll keep trying. Side note: are there any Reddit posts that talk about how to meet people or make friends??"
"vomiting blood...I get stressed in social situations which sets off an ulcer in my stomach, trips to the supermarket usually lead to me having to double time it to the toilet to avoid making a mess on the floor.  also tinnitus; when I get stressed it gets worse and it knocks me off balance, pretty much avoid going out because of it, can hardly walk down the stairs at home without ending up on my arse."
"Have to make plans super I’m advance so I can psych myself up enough time actually go, even if I would want to go anyways. Friend asks me to hangout last minute, even if I’d enjoy going I make up reasons why I can’t go. Less people start asking to hang out because I always decline. Lose friends. Sadness. "
"For me something as simple as going to the store takes a lot of meditating, sometimes I think to myself for the whole day about whether or not to go to places; I also noticed that I have to poop before heading to school or anywhere where I might have to interact with people, like i'm sub-consciously nervous almost every time it's a pain in the ass(he he).
PS: I've put off my haircut for 2 weeks now, sometimes this is crippling to my daily life."
Imagine that every conversation is a QTE that's near impossible to redo when you miss a button press.
"Nightmarish.   


In any social situation, even in ones involving people who you know well and trust, your brain becomes so locked up with anxiety it is almost like you lose ten or twenty IQ points just trying to deal with it in your head. Literally, it becomes harder to think clearly or quickly. It almost feels like, if your brain was a computer, that it is lagging or locking up from a program using up too much memory or something. For me personally, it can get to the point where counting out change to pay for stuff can be nearly impossible (and one of the reasons I rarely try to pay for things with change). Conversation can be impossible, depending on the severity of the anxiety.   


Then of course there are the uncomfortable physical symptoms, such as a pounding heart, feeling flushed, sweating, nausea, etc. I don't know if other people with anxiety experience this, but I've noticed that my anxiety-induced sweating (what I term the ""panic sweats"") smells more strongly/differently than ordinary sweat. Which, of course, just makes the whole situation more stressful and horrible. It's like you literally stink of fear.  


And all of this goes on while you are perfectly aware that there is no reason whatsoever that it should be going on, and you spend an inordinate amount of time trying to relax this ungodly fear response that for whatever reason your body or genes or whatever have decided should activate in the presence of any other member of your highly social species.  


I've also found that when I'm on anti-anxiety medication that takes care of all the psychological symptoms, for some reason my anxiety-induced nausea goes into overdrive and I will actually vomit in situations I would ordinarily be anxious in, even if I don't feel any anxiety symptoms in my head whatsoever. It's the weirdest fucking thing. "
"Untrusting of your own ability to talk to people and uncertain of people accepting you, even when you have no reason to feel like this."
"A lot of great replies have described what triggers it, or why, but not how it *feels* 

When my parents once asked me what severe social anxiety felt like, I asked them to imagine they’re someone with a fear of heights, because that was easier for them to relate to. So you get dizzy going up ladders, feel queasy on balconies, sweat and hyperventilate just thinking about climbing up on the roof. It’s not necessarily silly or totally irrational, but it is automatic, you can’t help how you react. 

And you live in an apartment at the top of a skyscraper, so you’re always panicking a little. 

And the only way to leave your apartment is by crossing [a glass-floored sky-bridge](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/11/10/1415616640472_Image_galleryImage_LONDON_ENGLAND_NOVEMBER_1.JPG) to another skyscraper. Going to work, shops, or a restaurant in the other skyscraper, means slowly crawling out across that glass bridge and blubbering and feeling sick and sweating through your shirt with a dry mouth while staring at the ground hundreds of feet beneath. But everyone else is just strolling past you over the bridge. 

And you can’t stop dreading heights because they’re all through your day, and some days you wake up in bed panicking because you know the glass skybridge awaits you after breakfast, as always. And some days you can’t even bring yourself to open the door to your home and take that first step out into the skybridge. Some days you force yourself to, and you work in the other skyscraper all day, and then come home exhausted and adrenal and collapse in bed or try to numb yourself. Some days you get halfway across and turn back and hate yourself. 

And some weekends you just stay in bed, but you can’t stop thinking about the rest of the week, anticipating how horrible it’s going to be, and you start panicking just from thinking about it, even though you and your bed are solidly on the floor. 

So you start making excuses not to go to restaurants in the other skyscraper with friends and family. You get shopping delivered to your apartment. You turn down promotions that would have you working on the top floor of the other skyscraper, and eventually take a job that pays less but you can work from home three days a week. You’re more comfortable, you’ve found ways to accommodate your fear of heights, but you hate yourself and all the opportunities you’ve missed, all the birthday dinners you’ve missed, how alone you’ve become. 

And nobody understands your fear, because it doesn’t make sense to them, and they want an explanation that makes sense. After all, it’s not as though you could actually fall through a glass floor or anything."
I heard this example and it sums it up perfectly. Its like playing a video game where the enemy music is playing but no enemy shows up. But all the time. 
"Idk if this is how it is for everyone, but this is how it is for me:

Say there’s a social event or a party happening that you want to go to. There’s only two ways it ends.


You either hate yourself for not going and enjoying yourself, making friends, and just having a good time.

OR 

You hate yourself for going and screwing up in ways that I can only describe as being most likely an over-exaggeration of what actually happen. (Ex: “Stuttering a bit” turns to “Speaking gibberish”).

And it fucking sucks"

I was in therapy for it (as well as everything that goes with it) from 1982 to 1994. Little was accomplished. 

[Avoidant Personality Disorder](https://psychcentral.com/disorders/avoidant-personality-disorder/)

I learned the solution was to use a person as a bridge. If I know someone I'm comfortable with, I can use them to pilot the meeting, introducing, conversing with people. I work like their sidekick, interjecting but not leading the conversation. 

The worst part is, people like me. Girls are attracted to me. My coworkers like me and want me to do things with them outside of work. I'm smart, funny, and interesting. 

I know it's all in my head. I know I have nothing to fear, but fear itself. Still, I have a job with two coworkers. I haven't gone out on the weekend in months. I haven't got laid in almost five years because I'm terrified of girls, even when they are obviously attracted to me. 

When I get fast food, I eat it in my car. I can't call in a pizza order because phone calls are too much for me. I have turned down beautiful girls for sex and let me tell you, that really pisses them off. I have medical problems but I'm afraid of the doctor. 

My girlfriend died two weeks ago while I was at work. Instead of bawling my eyes out from losing the love of my life and a friend of 25 years and going to the hospital, I kept working and still haven't told the people I work with, even though they knew her. 

I'm 43 years old, it's probably too late to fix me. If you're young, get help. It only gets worse with age.

  It doesn't really do the situation justice.  For me it's that overwhelming feeling of having to exert energy and interact with people.  It's not that I'm afraid of talking to people.  But while I'm talking to them I have to really focus (ADHD). I'm thinking about a million other things,. including analyzing them and what they're saying that I'm all fuzzy.  I'm then trying to keep the conversation.  I then get nervous and cur the conversation short.

"The constant thought of people looking at you or thinking of you in a negative perspective. People having conversations or laughing even in your vicinity gives you fear that they are indeed laughing at you. Making eye contact with a stranger triggers the flight or fight response, and you will always choose flight. Every. Time. In high school for speeches I would willingly take an F to not stand and talk. In college I had to give a ten minute speech, I stood up, talked for literally one minute, covered the entire podium with sweat, messed up most words, laughed at myself, and then sat back down. The whole time was me just standing there staring at the desk sweating and laughing at myself. I will go to the gym with intent to stay and workout for an hour and a half and leave after twenty minutes because there is just one too many people in the same space. I once had an anxiety attack from the *thought* of having to make a phone call to acquire an internship let alone an actual internship.

If I even think I've bothered someone it takes a very long time and lots of mental coaching to convince myself that they don't hate me. Additionally if anyone does not react to me the way I react to them I'm convinced they hate me. I love doing new things and meeting new people, yet every new encounter is a fucking struggle. "

Just imagine how you feel facing a boss for the first time in dark souls. Apply that feeling to every social situation.

"I'm sure this will get buried but for me I grew up socially anxious. All through elementary, middle, and high school. I had a fairly toxic friend group. And the same kids went to all three schools so I was locked in to my clique for like 12 years. Im tall and used to be a bit clumsy which is a nightmare when you're trying to be inconspicuous. 


For me it was the fear of doing something stupid and being laughed out. I was lacking in confidence and I was bullied quite a bit when I was young so there was just this constant stress. Like you know when you're about to do something like cliff diving, or ziplining your body goes into that adrenaline mode. It felt like that with every interaction where I'd worry about all the social gaps in any given situation.
But I got to college where I had a change of scenery. New people for the first time in a decade, and right of the bat I noticed how normally I fit in, since nobody knew anything about me.. and then I just kinda faked it till I made it.

Ironically I've started to make it a point to do anything at all that terrifies me. It's built my confidence up to the point where I'm just your average extroverted dude with a hint of thrill seeking. I just graduated in December. "
"Keep in mind that an axiety disorder is the body's overreaction to situations -- imagine how you feel anxious in a situation where you think you're actually in danger. People with anxiety disorders feel like that often, in totally normal contexts. That's what it comes down to. 


With anxiety, you also tend to have a mentality where every single little decision is life of death. Any mistake I make I end up hysterical -- not literally crying, but thinking about it over and over for weeks. "

"It feels like someone is constantly staring at you and judging everything you’re doing. The only place I feel completely comfortable is in my room, alone. I don’t go to parties or other social gatherings because making small talk with strangers feels like nails on a chalkboard. I cannot physically go up to someone and start a conversation so I end up in the corner, by myself, feeling extremely out of place and like I need to get out of there asap. When I’m with a group of people and someone asks me a question, I can feel myself turn bright red as everyone turns to look at me and I stammer through an answer. It just makes life more difficult than it should be. It’s gotten better with age and purposefully putting myself in uncomfortable situations like public speaking and I coach volleyball now which is basically talking in front of 14 people for two hours everyday so it does get better, at least for me. But I just wish it wasn’t so hard to connect with others. It made me lonelier than I should’ve been. "
"I spent most of yesterday talking to a person online who almost always shows an interest in me when we speak and is happy to see me.

"Me and this girl at work started at the same time in a small office (only 4 of us).  I came in a little early one day and left my scissors on her desk.  The next time I needed those scissors I realized what I did.  Instead of asking her if she found an extra pair on her desk, I asked the coworker sitting closest to me if I can use theirs.  She has these child hello kitty scissors that are very uncomfortable for me to use because I have big hands.  

This was months ago, and now it has been going on for so long that even though I am more comfortable with her I can't say ""Hey, did you find an extra pair of scissors on your desk 2 months ago???""  That would be silly!  So instead I borrow the hello kitty scissors any time I need to cut paper.

That is what social anxiety feels like."
"I look at all these comments and a huge theme is that we are all so worried that everyone secretly hates us. I wonder where we get this from?

It feels like slowly losing the few friends you have because talking is so uncomfortable that you don't contact them until it's been so long you don't even know what to talk to them about.

It's having anxiety attacks about opening up about it because the one person you're okay with venting to surely must be sick of it by now.

I avoid eye contact because other people's eyes feel like lasers boring into me. I have to ask people not to touch me because it feels like being struck by lightning. I have to lock doors inside my house even when I'm alone just to feel secure. Sometimes I can't even stand attention from my cat.

It sucks, basically. Even when you're on meds."
"Have you ever been walking around and didn't pay enough attention and bump into someone, felt bad for inconveniencing them even if it wasn't a big deal?  Or started talking to someone not realizing they were busy and trying to concentrate, again felt bad when you realized you had done that.  Just little things like that where your presence or attempts to interact with someone was a minor inconvenience and even if you know they dont care all that much you remember how much it annoys you when you're on the receiving end of it so you still feel a bit bad about it.  Now imagine feeling like that constantly, knowing that if you try to talk to someone you're bothering them, if you stand somewhere you're in someone's way, and every once in a while you're reminded that that feeling is right, you bothered someone, you made their day just a little worse by existing and not hiding in a hole out of everyone's way.

Something along those lines."
"It's extremely difficult to look people in the eyes. You don't know what to say most of the time, leading to awkward pauses and silences. You feel uncomfortable in social situations, often to the point where others can see you are uncomfortable. You stumble over your words when you can manage to get something out. Constantly feeling out of place and awkward."
"Social Anxiety feels like there's a camera on you at all times. Its like watching a scary movie that you also star in, and the music just starts slowly ramping up in intensity. Then instead of the killer jumping out it just keeps getting worse. The anticipation is making your heart pound, you hear thudding in your ears, and then it just stops. Only there's nothing scary happened so you're now completely paranoid that you missed it.  
  

A thousand eyes judging and watching you for the slightest hiccup in ""normal"" human life. Then the second you say or do the wrong thing they will keep reminding you that you did it, and there's no redos.  
  

You can't look anyone in the eyes since obviously they know every shameful thing you've ever done, and are just waiting for you to go away so they can talk about all of it.  
  

You can't talk to strangers since you're going to stutter, talk too fast, or say something they're going to take the worst way possible. You're going to shove your foot in it, so you shouldn't even open your mouth. Even if you did they're going to think you're creepy, and since it took you a few minutes to figure out what you were going to say you're also a stalker too.  
  

Same with friends. Except you know the second you mess up they're going to leave you, so its best not to talk unless they ask you a question. Even then you need to stop for a few minutes, so you don't say anything too controversial.  
  

You'll never have this problem with cashiers though. You need to justify every purchase with some made up story about your friends forgetting movie snacks. Even though you've worked as a cashier before, and know no one cares that you're buying six pints of ice cream all for you to depression eat.  
  

Don't even think about dating. Since real life dating means talking to someone about yourself, and that's a dangerous road. No one really likes you after all, and anything they do is really all a lie or an interest you only got into to talk about something besides yourself with friends. Online dating is even worse since everything is a lie. You're like the reverse catfish. You look like that in person, but every inch of composure and actually personality you developed by taking thirty minutes to respond to someone is gone. Also, you don't really look like what they think you do.  


Every action has to be done five steps in advance, and you better hope no one stares at you. If they do you have to abort mission and walk away as quickly as possible. Otherwise there's no hope for you, and you must end yourself on the spot.  "
"Super late! I'm not officially diagnosed, but I feel like I have a lot of symptoms of social anxiety. I care a lot about what people think about me and I constantly think that my friends hate me, even when I know they love and care for me.

"My social anxiety used to be a lot worse before I really had to figure out how socialization works on my own, but I constantly assume that people are thinking and saying the worst about me. I used to not even be able to speak to people unless they spoke quite a bit to me first so I knew it was okay, I just kind of assumed that anything I said would make people think I was weird and annoying. Now I can speak to people fairly uninhibitedly, but when I'm alone, I am constantly reviewing every little awkward thing I've said or done and freaking out over how other perceived it. Even people I'm friends with who I know genuinely like me and my personality, it's hard not to think that maybe they're just being nice because they feel sorry for me, even if it's completely irrational and I know they're not the type of person to be friends with someone they don't like. It's easier to keep it on a level with the knowledge that these thoughts are unrealistic, but it's still a struggle."

All those thoughts keeps you from being fully engaged in the situation, any social situation. Nothing feels like it comes naturally. It feels like you are just trying to act the part of a normal person and people will find out if you do it wrong. "
I'm too shy to say
Frustrating and discouraging. 
"I believe, ""like shit"", to be the correct response to your question. "
Wanting to avoid social events and hiding in the restroom.

Terrible 
anxious and sweaty?
I didn’t always have social anxiety and I’m an extrovert. I developed social anxiety from trauma in my life and basically it feels like something is always going to go wrong when you talk to people and when you think like that it usually does. You’re always worried about social interaction which is obviously a huge part of life.
Like your own brain is waiting for you to make a mistake 
Yeh
"Like chewing 5 gum.

"
"You're scared people are watching your every move and waiting for you to mess up so they can make fun of you but also scared that people don't notice you at all and no one will remember you. Like, damn, brain, what do you want from me? Hurry up and pick a fucking struggle."
"Constant fight or flight. Electricity beaming up and down your entire body. Overanalyzing every word said. Never feeling comfortable even around people who have explicitly said you're okay. Feeling drained. Feeling totally inadequate and unwanted even when you have applicable words to say, even when they're great and could better the conversation happening, and you know that. Being constantly in your own way. 

Feels like fighting, everyday, just to be human. Just to be me. Sucks. Terror for no reason. Feels like I'm here too, but everyone else beats me to the punch. 

Ouch."
"In my experience, it’s having a panic attack when your best friend says they wanna come to your house, even though you’re really happy about it, but you start to overthink your ability to show hospitality; “they’re going to get bored, you don’t know how to have fun and they’re going to hate being there and never want to come around again” (I decided not to cancel it and it turned out fine lol)

I don’t know if it’s the same for most people, but I think *my* social anxiety at least, generally comes from a lack of confidence in my ability to socialise, and also a feeling that I’m going to somehow fuck up and be judged, or at least that the people I interact with are just going to be rude for no reason. I haven’t been right about that so far, and generally once I’ve done something I was scared to do, I can do it without panicking next time. Except phone calls 😅

I’ve, on multiple occasions, spent 3+ days preparing to make a phone call cuz I’ll sit there staring at the dial pad almost in tears and my heart will be racing, so I just think “maybe tomorrow” cuz mum won’t make phone calls for me anymore 😂

I still get really anxious if I have to serve multiple people in a row at work, and I’ve been working for a year now, but I guess that can be stressful regardless."
"You know that dream where you're in your freshman lit class to give a speech on the literary importance of 'Goodnight Moon' and it turns out you're in your underwear and you can hear the thoughts of everyone judging you? That feeling in the pit of your stomach. But not all of the time. Only some of the time. However, you're never 100% certain when that feeling is going to hit. Which makes you a nervous wreck. "
You're always nervous about people judging you for things you do and avoid social interaction as much as possible. I've got to the point where I often unsened messages on dm (even if they're totally normal messages or small talk or something) for fear of them judging me. I don't know how to get over it and it sucks
You feel like you're sitting an a pool of uncertainty as each moment passes 
"The feeling of the few days before you get your exam results, that.  All day everyday, for me even when i am around family"
Feelsbadman
"Who told you I have social anxiety?... I don't have social anxiety, so whoever told you I have social anxiety is a lier."
"I only feel it when I'm trying to talk to girls. Other than that it's just maybe avoiding eye contact with people because sometimes people do it to me like I'm gonna kill them, which gets annoying sometimes but I forget to smile a lot. 

I'm just focused on where I'm heading because I'm usually late for uni. Shouldn't be a problem next year since I live alot closer to uni now."
bad
It's emotionally draining
"Feeling out of place, scared to approach anyone directly, wondering what to say how to say it and eventually just deciding to say nothing at all. "
"It's really fun.
I'll trade ya mine."
Everything is scary. I cant go to the store it's just too scary even though nothing bad can happen. Interaction with people feels very wrong. 
"Not having many friends, but want in to go to a bar for drinks and a snack. Getting outside of the bar, seeing all of the people in the bar. Coming up with every stupid reason not to go in ""maybe there's no seats, what if I dont like the menu, people will think in weird for going in alone"" etc. Going to go in to the bar but you can't physically bring your self to go in. Chalking it up to ""this place sucks"". Walk to the next place, rinse, repeat."
"You know that feeling when you're going out to take your dog for a walk and you step outside as fresh air fills your lungs and sunlight kisses your skin? I don't. I only know the feeling of water filling my lungs and stares burning into my skin when I step outside.

As a student, I failed exams because I never knew how to ask for help. I never knew how to catch up when I was absent for lessons because I was too nervous to ask. I only communicated through emails to teachers and couldn't even look them in the eye in person. I would constantly have to leave in the middle of class because I was having a panic attack. Social anxiety really disrupts everything you do."
"I used to be good looking and had a customer service job. Lots of people smiling at me and others who don’t. Started to hate my job and found it hard to smile at customers.  I felt I had a resting bitch face so I would force a smile or hold my face a certain way. I developed a lot of facial tension issues. Forced to leave the job as I couldn’t handle it. I feel the tension in my face form the moment I leave my apartment. It makes me look unhappy, sad, ugly. I can’t interact with anyone like this.  Have had this issue for 10 years and haven’t figured it out.  Lost friends, well paying job to this. "
"the need to shit really badly and throwing up.
"
"Generalised anxiety chiming in here - but if I'm anxious in social situations I usually find myself more dissasociative than violently anxious. Like, I can function but I'm just going through the motions and I'm usually very quiet until I can ground myself or get a handle on my breathing."
I wouldn't say that my social anxiety is really bad but I feel I have some anxiety when approaching or speaking to other people. Its mostly caused by my stutter. I feel stressed out when meeting new people because of the fear of stuttering when speaking to that person. And I also don't know how he will react.
"It's really difficult to make friends, getting a SO,etc.
It's also very suffocating at times :/"
You have so many great ideas to share but the moment you open your mouth nothing but air comes out.
"its fucking terrible

the idea that your friends will suddenly not want to be your friend anymore because you are either boring, or they heard stuff about you that you didnt know about

the idea that everyone is just in it to be your friend as a joke, then finding out that it is and then other people befriend you because it was out of pity and moral obligation

the idea that you are never going to be good enough for anybody and that youre going to stick with you and no one else since no one actually thinks you're worth a single second of time with

all of those just keeps swirling in your head and makes you feel like you never deserved to exist on this planet because everybody just doesnt like you and doesnt want to admit it because if they did, you wouldnt be able to control yourself, then you would commit suicide, and then they would be labeled as a bad person for making you kill yourself


thats basically me, and the many people that have social anxiety
"
"Every conversation feels like I'm a pinball in a pinball machine. I am just getting bounced back and forth and I have no clue what's going on. So, I stay inside, because I'd rather stay inside than leave the house and embarrass myself.

Weed has helped, but all it does is get rid of my anxiety - I still say dumb shit, I just don't care that it's dumb."
They just added player interaction to a video game I play.  Now random people show up and I'm too nervous to talk to them
"I wouldnt know, i've barely been able to go outside or talk to people while looking at them.

Something like that basically."
"Constantly thinking people are judging you.
Constantly looking at different parts of the face, maintaining eye contact is very hard.
You want to go out and enjoy social events but you tell yourself you'll just want to go home as soon as you arrive so you dont go and then your depressed.
You fear that everyone is out to get you or against you.
Going to the supermarket is a hassle because you fear talking to random strangers. 
Talking to someone over the phone and getting to know them, finally setting up a meet and then you back out of fear that they wont like you in person so you flake out, then you either come up with some stupid excuse or ignore them, now you lost a potential friend and you fear doing it again.  
You constantly remembering all your awkward social encounters which makes you cringe and ignore people.  
Honestly it's horrible to feel, I know what's wrong with me but it's so hard to fix.

Edit; also whenever your phone rings your brain thinks of the worst possible scenario for the phone call.
"
"Here are a couple situations I went through last week:

Imagine your friends inviting you somewhere and you’re excited because they thought to include you. Then right before the event you realize ‘oh shit I can’t do this I need to find an excuse’. Then subsequently lie to them in order to not be in a social situation, then be angry with yourself afterwards.

Coworker is moving to a new state so everyone in the office goes out to wish her farewell. We go to a local brewery after work and I try to avoid going because of my fear of social settings. The cute girl at work who I like but I doubt likes me is there. We talk for a bit and I make a joke and she laughing and lightly touching my shoulder. I instantly think, ‘oh shit, does she like me too? No she couldn’t you’re reading too far into it. Ok get out now before you embarrass yourself in front of your coworkers’. So, after she walks away to grab another beer I softy say to everyone I am late for something and basically run to my car. Didn’t even say bye to my friend who was moving. Then I get to my car feeling like I’m going to pass out and so angry that I did what I did."
It feels like you are inferior and everyone else is superior to you.
"I read a couple of replies here but my experience has been a little different. But maybe because mine is anxiety mixed with depression.

Have you ever been scared of something? Like something bad was about to happen? Maybe you had a really strict teacher or a parent that you were terrified of. And maybe you did something to piss them off and you are about to meet them again and you know they will bite your head off. And you're helpless just awaiting your fate.

Or maybe you did something really embarrassing. And right now only a handful of people witnessed it but you know soon this news will spread and everyone will come to know the embarrassing thing you did. And you're helpless and can't stop it. You are waiting for this horrible thing to happen. You know you're doomed. This thing is so painful and nerve-wrecking that you don't even want to die, you just want to disappear right at this very moment without a trace so that you don't have to face whatever's gonna happen to you. So that you don't have to face anyone ever again.

That. That's what anxiety felt like to me. I live alone. The phone rings. But instead it feels like a loud shrill, screeching noise. Doesn't matter even if the ringtone is not loud and in reality it actually sounds pleasant. It feels as though something awful is going to happen. You can feel it in your gut and it makes you sick. Like you can't even move. It's so painful that you almost dissociate with reality and it feels dream like.. or rather a nightmare. A nightmare you can't wake up from. It's just my mom calling but I can't even talk to her. I just let it ring till it stops. And I feel completely exhausted.

That's what anxiety felt like. Every single encounter with another person was painful and nerve wrecking. It left me exhausted. With medication things are much much better. So there's that."
"Living under constant fear, which eventually leads to depression. Also, we are quite sensitive, like unbelievably sensitive!"
Incredibly feeling of dread and worry. Trepidation.
"Constantly policing your behaviour.

Constantly paranoid about how that behaviour appears to others.

The inability to hold someone's gaze or even meet it.

Constant apologies or excuses for any interaction.

That lurch in your gut when you miss a step on the stairs everytime the phone rings or the door knocks. "
"here’s kind of an analogy:
imagine you’re walking down the street, you see everyone giving you weird looks, gesturing at you, and snickering to their friends. you don’t know what you’re doing wrong.. but you know you’re doing /something/ wrong. you can feel it. you just don’t know what it is or how to fix it."
"Starting off with bad knees that prevent me walking a lot and leaving me feeling like I walk funny my brain process goes something like this.

I think I'm walking funny, what if someone is watching me.
Maybe limp a bit more so it's obvious to anyone watching why I'm walking funny.

Shit, both my knees are fucked, I'm trying to limp with two legs, wtf am I doing, people are definitely watching me.

Fuck, I feel like I'm sweating because I'm stressing out, can they see me sweating, do I like weird, are they looking.

Holy shit, some knee pain, twinge almost causes me to trip, someone had to see that right, they think I'm fucking retarded.

I need to get home, shut the curtains and sit down. How many more stupid awkward steps till I get home, kill me, kill me, kill me.

Phew, inside, relaxed, though those people probably think I'm weird, at least I'm safe and away from people.

I really can't stand walking to the end of my driveway to put the rubbish bins out.... thank fuck no one was around."
"Who wants to know? 

All jokes aside, I think I might have social anxiety but I think it's more social paranoia. I overthink all of my social interactions and coupled with my lack of social skills it's a terrible burden. I'm surprised I haven't tried anything dangerous to cope with it. "
"You feel like you're so close to being able to interact normally but you also feel so far away. Something really fun can be happening 10 feet away, and you know what to do, but actually doing it is frightening. But, for me, I always felt like I was on some other planet from these other people, all in the same building as me having a great time, and there I am, looking around and wondering what the hell is wrong with me that I can't do that.

Just plain life experience has gotten me out of this for the most part but my entire 20s were taken up by social anxiety and it was the most confusing time of my life. I never knew how to interact or what to do. Once in awhile something good would happen to me and I'd get 'drunk on confidence' and I'd be fine but that magic usually had a short expiration date.

What kept it going for me was having a really shitty best friend at the time who would keep saying ""What's wrong with you?"" when the anxiety would hit. As soon as I got away from her, the anxiety started to slowly fade away and I developed."
I physically shook and teared up when i walked past people. I thought everyone laughing was laughing at me.
"I’m 30 and still have social anxiety. When I was a teen and early 20s it was bad, but it’s getting much better. The trick is that when you feel scared, you have to jump in and say or do something. I try to reason with myself that I’m the long run nobody remembers that weird thing you said at that company party years ago. Either you live a life in fear of saying something stupid or you try to do something about it. It’s a very easy choice when I frame it like this. "
Wanna talk with people and do volunteer work or even a job. Hehe yet I would rather drop dead when confronted with these scenarios. And I freeze up over nothing while talking
Judging by the answers I think I might have social anxiety.. I thought it was normal to feel this way
"Socialising is a skill that needs to be maintained otherwise you lose it.  


Social anxiety makes people not want to socialise, which in turn compounds the problem, because they're no longer getting any practice in.  


Expecting to be able to socialise in the same way as highly social people, when you've been living like a hermit for years, is similar to expecting to be able to bench press any amount you want when you haven't worked out in years.  


You've gotta build it up, and it's bloody painful to begin with."
"I used to have terrible social anxiety. I somehow talked myself out of it for the most part.. I think it’s because I was pretty ugly until my senior year of high school and then I ended up kind of pretty and started dating someone who was a lot more popular than me, and at my school when someone note popular dated someone less popular it was kind of a big deal. I started getting more attention so I had to get used to it. Going to college at first was really hard and I didn’t even have a solid group of friends November of freshman year. I still get nervous around people I don’t know that well but I have to remember they’re probably not judging me as much as I think. I honestly just stopped caring and I don’t even really know how because my social anxiety used to be SEVERE. I hope this gives someone hope that you can make it through :)"
"Small talk is too much, if you're someone I don't know and you're asking a lot of questions than I am just freaking out inside. But because of the social anxiety I'm too afraid to end the conversation and walk away so I just wait. I don't even remember a lot of what people say because in my head I'm just shouting for them to go away."
"If I get a lot of non-work related messages (even friends), I get nervous and anxious. Connecting with people through technology and phones gives me hella SA"
Great now fuck off and leave me alone ..
"It kinda feels like you're standing in line for rollercoaster. That discomfort for something that is about to happen or should happen that is exaggerated in your mind. At least for me.

Also, not addressing and confronting things that may seem benign. I was too scared to ask what the expense policy was for my new job because I was scared I was being seen as too money grabbing when it really was a standard and very necessary procedure for everyone on a new project.

"
"You feel that everybody is just laughing at you inside, while they make a straight face. Also: you don't want to annoy people by your existence, so you don't approach them. You are weird, God, why can't you be normal like all the other people
"
"I can make friends but have a constant internal commentary and have to convince myself that it doesn’t mean they hate me if I’m not invited to every single dinner and lunch and last minute catch up. 

Then when I’m with people I talk a lot and over share to try and avoid any lulls or silences. I’m hyper vigilant to every facial expression and action and whisper, wondering what they might mean and how it could effect me. 

It’s exhausting. "
"I have slightly different forms than others I think, for me i go red when people talk to me, especially of there are a lot of people. My lips does a stupid shake thing and my heart races making me slightly breathless.  The more people are around the higher chances of this happening. I get it every day, even just taking the train it’s the worst. 

Only thing that helps is for me is exercising. Don’t know if it’s endorphins or what but it helps. "
You have an another personality inside you that wants to get attention and be social but you're just so afraid of being rejected and embarrassed so you just do nothing that you wanna do and die inside.
"When I get into a situation where I have to talk to new people, my brain kind of goes on autopilot, and I talk normally, but then a few hours later it's like I just sobered up and I realise all the stuff I said and how stupid I could have looked to these people. The most important thing to remember is that they probably won't remember you said the dumb thing unless you remind them."
"Conspiracy theories about yourself. Constantly thinking of ""What if?""s for what others may think of you. It can be simply ""What if this person doesn't care about what I'm saying?"" and then it can escalate to ""What if every one of my friends liking me is a facade and they all secretly talk in group chats without me, sometimes about how they don't like me?"". It can be easily disproven through logic and reasoning but it also lingers at the back of your brain nawing at you every time you make some sort of social mistake (like a joke that no one laughs at or doing some awkward thing)."
"Simply put, exhausting. The mental strain is tiresome."
"On the rare occasion I do speak, I usually have instant regret after I have said the thing.  Especially when it's someone I don't know very well, and especially when it's something personal about myself. Then I can stop thinking to myself  ""why the hell did I just tell them that."" "
You rarely ever feel comfortable or yourself unless you're on your own
Like having the windshield wipers on high while it’s sprinkling. 
"And people think you can just learn to get over it, or are making it up. I get that a lot "
I still hide when someone rings the doorbell unexpectedly. I'm 22
It's like when you're playing a game and the enemy music id playing but there are enemies in sight.
Slightly sweaty
"I irrationally assume people will dislike me by default, and I have to win them over by being funny or interesting. I'm constantly racing to think of appropriate things to say."
One guy explained like being in that exact moment of having tipped your chair too far and realizing you're gonna fall but for hours instead of a split second. Does not sound pleasant. 
"I have 2 levels of social anxiety

1. Is basically what all the top comments describe

2. A very surreal and unfortunate experience. No matter if it’s new people or friends i’ve had for years. On occasion i’ll get stomach problems like no other. Sharp pains, cramps, feelings of diarrhea or puking (even if i don’t do either, it feels like 1 could happen at ant moment). The worst part is, i don’t feel ANY anxiety in my head, so i guess it’s all subconscious.  I literally have no worries. This always occurs when I either make plans, or am on my way to plans i’ve made. It really sucks. This actually kept forcing me to stay home from school. I was constantly sick as a dog in school and would leave early or not come in at all. The worst part is, as soon as I get home my stomach begins to calm down as if nothing is wrong which lead to a lot of people (parents, doctors, school officials) to think I was faking which caused me ACTUAL anxiety and stress which created a never ending cycle."
"Being compelled by the group and the environment, leading to possible negative consequences, like the tinnitus I have right now. I feel quite stupid. Thus instead of moving away from the loud music, I stood there instead."
"Thoughts. All the time. My heart beats really fast whenever I enter a public space (shopping centre for example) and it feels like everyone is watching all the time. I love seeing friends and having fun but I find it really hard to actually say yes and go.

Talking to people is a struggle, makes me grateful for my friends though since I feel comfortable around them.

Social anxiety (and anxiety in general) wears you out, makes you lose focus, your heart beats really fast and you may also feel a little sick. I am super self-conscious of myself in general because of it, I'm always worried what people think."
"I only have it mild but even that sucks. 

You’re overaware of everything you say and do. You’re judging yourself for every little movement. There’s an underlying fear of judgement and of people not liking you. 

It can be as little as a constant feeling of uneasiness, but as much as full on conversations with yourself in your head. 

You feel like nobody likes you - like you have to try very hard to make sure they *do* like you. 

You feel like you’re acting weird when you’re acting normal. 

You feel like you have to justify everything you *think* is weird with “Sorry if I’m being weird - I’m tired / in a weird mood / had a lot of sugar” style justifications. 

You feel defensive and hyper aware of what’s going on around you despite looking relaxed on the outside. 

As a dude - this sucks. 

And this is only mild. "
"Everything you do is wrong.

Yes, someone is watching.

Yes, they are judging.

Basic human interaction is so awkward that's it's easier to stay home than it is to check the letterbox and risk having to see the neighbour.

Were you invited to an event? Are there people? What am I going to say to say in conversation, I have nothing interesting to talk about and don't know what questions are polite conversations, or what questions are weird. How should I interact? I'm just going to be the weird person in the corner who's all quiet and never says anything. Don't bother going, you're just going to bring the place down. And even if I do go, what do I take? Do I need to get cash out? If I do need to get cash out, do I need to break the 50's into 5's, 10's, 20's so I've got change. What should I wear? Is this too casual? Too formal? Have I put on weight? This shirt no longer looks good.

Oh god, now I have to uber there, do I sit in the front/back? Do I talk? Do I sit quietly? I don't really want to talk, but does that mark me weird? What should I say? Oh great, I've asked how they're day is going. They've probably been asked that 50 times today, way to go mr original. Sportsball? You don't know what sportsball to talk about...

And that's before you've even arrived and said hi to someone. By the time you've gone through every minor little thing you're too exhausted to go out. Not to mention you are sure that you'll do the wrong thing anyway.

This also applies to every normal day activity such as (but not limited to)

\-going to the shops for groceries

\-going to a park

\-going for a walk with the dog

\-leaving the house for any reason whatsoever

\-typing up a reddit post. I'm 99.9% sure I haven't typed this post up in a way to convey the sheer anxiety I feel at every little thing that I'll come across when I leave the house.  


(and I was right - I had to edit and add 'sure' after 99.9% because I did that wrong)"
Bad
Like you're gonna die and nothing can convince you otherwise. It fucking sucks.
"I don't want to engage with anyone about anything. I'm not self conscious, at least not more than the average person, but I never want to be approached by anyone. Phone calls feel inconvenient. When I'm in public, I want to be back home. It's not that I don't like people, I think they're interesting and unique, but that doesn't mean I need to spend time with them. "
"It's hard to explain.


I feel really self-conscious over everything I do and say.


Even if I need to tell someone something, important or not, I just feel the need to not tell them what I want to say in fear of being judged negatively.


In addition to all this, I constantly feel like my friends hate me despite being treated like a good friend to them, for some reason that I don't know.
If I feel I may have said something that I assume may have offended them, I think about it off an excessive amount of time and (mentally) beat myself up over it.


I also feel very nervous when people I know or don't know give me a look whether I had said something or not."
For me it’s feeling very uncomfortable and self conscious and even scared when in a party or large crowds
Like you're constantly the stupidest person in the room unless there's someone worse than you 
Lt. Reginald Barclay was one the [best portrays](https://youtu.be/dEJuKY_APIk) of social anxiety I have ever related to on TV.
It's like continually hearing the boss music and never seeing the threat. 
"I had social anxiety and it feels like everybody around you is judging you. I would wait in line at the supermarket and worry if the cashier will like me or not. I would worry about what I should say to her. What if I say something stupid? And note, this is just a cashier I’ve never met before and will likely never meet again. 

Anyway, I’ve gotten much better now after reading a book I highly recommend “The solution to social anxiety” by Dr Aziz. He produces a lot of free content on YouTube and through podcasts too. Please please if you have social anxiety, at least watch his YouTube video https://youtu.be/1bXFabDpj-Q that’s what started my journey to curing social anxiety. 

The root cause of social anxiety is that we think we are not good enough. We’re afraid that if someone were to find that out, then they’ll hate us. But the truth is, we ARE good enough. We constantly berate ourselves in our mind, this inner critic who is constantly criticizing our every interaction. "
If feels like you can't be yourself for the fear that everyone is going to judge you hard for it. Karioke? People will make fun of my voice. Clubbing? They'll laugh at my dancing. Talking to a group? They'll probably all walk away. Dating? Oh you can forget about anyone even remotely attractive liking you back
"I feel like I'm always trying to keep a normal face on during a conversation. 

I used to be pretty damn smooth back in the day. I think drugs + introverting myself have taken a toll on my social skills, which lead to the social anxiety. 

I've been trying to fight back against it to resharpen my social skills bit by bit. I think I've been seeing progress. 

Strangest part is the people I talk to about it, say that I don't appear nervous or anything. I guess it's just in my head? 

EDIT : I think the very first thing I started working on was forcing myself to make eye contact. I'm pretty good at that now, although I don't know if I'm making too solid of eye contact and when/if/how often to break it. "
"Imagine the constant worry that no-one really likes you, and is only pretending to be your friend to not hurt your feelings. I know it's stupid, but it doesn't stop me thinking about how it's possible. Also the constant feeling of being judged by everyone, constantly thinking about how you're acting, always thinking about how you look to others... and so on."
Just imagine that every single person around you at most times knows every embarrassing and humiliating thing you've ever said or done and is jus *dying* for you to give them an opportunity to bring it up and start a chain - reaction of agony you can't escape from. 
"Ever written a message to someone and then decided not to send it because you think its stupid? It's like that, but for every single interaction and down to the smallest details.  
How should I be standing, where do my hands go, does this person I'm walking behind at the shops think I'm following them? Oh god that person in the car at the lights next to me wont stop looking at me, what did I do?  
Honestly 90%+ of what I physically type I never click post/send on. "
"Man, I can't wait to go out and finally throw some dice at the local game store. I've spent hours researching units for my army, watching tactics videos on YouTube, reading strategies and after action reports, and meticulously painting dozens of tiny soldiers.

The time to leave has come.

I will be late.

"It feels like there's a predator in the room with you - like a lion, or a wolf, circling. It could attack at any moment, but it's waiting for you to show weakness, to screw up somehow.

I'm a little atypical for someone with social anxiety in that my social skills are actually pretty good; a lot of people I know probably don't know it's a problem for me or don't think it's too bad. But I'm motivated to be good at it because I'm terrified I'll screw up, or take an emotional blow if I let my guard down. Showing how anxious I feel would risk judgment - when you're in a room with a lion, you can't show fear, but you're absolutely terrified.

And that means that being around other people is EXHAUSTING. I can't keep it up for too long, because I'm hyper-aware of everyone, trying to figure out as much as I can so I can control the situation and keep things from going horribly wrong (which in my head, could happen at any moment). Even when I'm with friends, and having a good time, and there's no reasonable chance of stuff going wrong, it's exhausting, even though I'd like nothing better most of the time.

Which makes it VERY hard to do anything new, socially, even if you do have good social skills. If you have no experience, you can't make predictions, and you're almost inevitably going to make mistakes, which in your head is always going to result in disaster. Not worth the risk. And then you just feel bad about all the stuff you're missing out on."
"Can someone please tell me how to help/support someone that xoes have social anxiety! Ome of my close friends has it and I feel like every time I try to do something, I just make it worse."
"Heard it best described as 
‘You know when the music changes in a video game and you know there’s some big bad around the corner but you can’t see them yet? That. All the time. ‘"
"""The conversation slowed down after you talked. You said something stupid and everyone thinks you're weird/stupid/annoying!""

My internal thought process. It, ah, makes it difficult to join or keep up with conversations. I'm slowly getting better by participating in Xbox chats while I game, but I still have a ways to go before natural real life conversation manifests."
"I honestly feel like everybody has social anxiety. When I was younger I had it worse. Now it’s not so bad. Fix your diet, figure out what’s wrong in your life, take steps to become more comfortable with who you are. Labeling it and making it real is stupid, just another way to sell Xanax to teenagers "
"I'm gonna focus on one single part.

Have you ever locked your car door, shut it, and then had your heartbeat jump to a million bpm as you start patting your body looking for keys you're 100% sure (in the moment at least) are now locked in the car?

That. It feels like that 24/7 365 and I'm tired."
Like you're always playing a timed escape level in a video game but you don't know where the exit is. Take that feeling and apply it to thoughts of being unable to escape an embarrassing or awkward situation and knowing that worrying about it is only making things more awkward.
This was the right place to ask.
Shitty
"Too much adrenaline for a supposedly fun or everyday occasion, which kicks in Fight or Flight, which usually ends up being Flight. "
"For me, it’s:

- Stumble on your words / say the wrong word in public? Good luck forgetting that for the next 15 years.

- See people from school / work in a non school / work place? They’re probably actively gossiping about me.

- Put on the spot? Stumble on your words. Refer to the top of this list.

- Do something that mildly inconveniences someone? Either apologize profusely (very awkward) or say nothing (awkward).

"Picture this: it took me several tries to press the ""add comment"" button and several versions of a similar message to this, all because I kept thinking what I was posting was stupid, that people would think bad, and a general feeling of ""I'd just annoy them...""

It sucks, in short."
"I am terrible at remembering names.

When i meet someone new always tell them i will forget their name and to not be offended when i ask it again in the future.

They always say its no problem and i can ask if i forget.

I always forget.

I never ask them again because they might get offended that i forgot.



Extrapolate this to literally every action you take."
"My best friend is very extroverted, and we're a package deal now, because I can't talk to people."
"Do you know how you feel before you take a really important essay? Or before you have an interview? Imagine feeling like that for every minute in your life without knowing why. You just feel better if there is no way a person could talk/criticize or judging you. Have in mind: You don't have that at home because any minute someone could knock on the door. Some people isolate themselves and get other problems like gaining weight. That makes it even harder to cure that pain.  Just going out and fight that anxiety fails most of the time because your brain tells you after that that you really fucked up. You go through every little thing you said and what could be hold against you (or could judge you). That makes your anxiety even bigger. 

Even overthinking stupid shit like crossing a road. *How should I pass that guy? Left or right? What if I go right and he does too? That would be so uncomfortable. Damn I think I wait until I don't need to pass someone*. No joke there were moments I waited for the next bus because otherwise I would have tell someone to move or I couldn't go in"
Being serious. Why are most people with anxiety Caucasian?
I didn’t go to the dentist for three years because I knew I’d have to call and make an appointment. Now I go regularly because they automatically schedule another appointment when I’m there and text me to remind me. 
"I have had social anxiety since I was in fourth grade. 
I am now a sophomore in a 4 year college.
I still have it and it grows worse everyday.

Everyone here seems to be describing the emotional or mental taxes of social anxiety but I am here to guide you through my exact processes everytime I am outside of my house wether it be at Qdoba, Starbucks, the library, the mall, and my worst offender a school classroom!

I sit in a room surrounded by one or multiple people. I question myself and try to calculate my moves. I really want to get up and get a glass of water! Nope. People will think your weird and stupid. Sit down. Do it later. But I’m thirsty! No you’re not, you can wait. 
Cue more battling with self until I finally dig up the courage to get up and fill a glass of water and drink it.

But now there’s one problem. My hands and my body are growing feverishly warm and I have an instant headache my ears start to ring and voices around me grow quieter even if they’re actually loud and my hands are starting to hurt as if I have arthritis and my hands and my body are sweating like a pig and my vision is drawing closer with less saturation until I fall light headed and pass out.

That is my process.

I hate having social anxiety. I always get a hot flash, a pit in my stomach grows, and my heart sinks deeper and faster than an anchor off of a boat would. It’s the worst and it’s weird. "
"Every mistake is highlighted in your mind, you think everyone notices it just as much as you do (even when you tell yourself no one will)

Every whispered conversation is about you. You spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about hypothetical conversations. You think if you're even slightly unprepared for something you're the biggest waste of time for everyone.

And because of a lot of this, its often exhausting to hold conversations with people."
"There's a group of people over there. They're all your coworkers, and they're always very nice to you. 

They smile and say ""good morning,"" and they often have small conversations with you. You like them.

But you're not going to go over there. That group is an island neighboring yours, and the waters in between are deep and unexplored. 

Instead, you listen to them chat and silently add replies and comments to the mix. You know a good joke that might make them laugh. You know the answer to someone's question. Someone mentions a hobby you have, too.

But you won't speak up, because that's as impossible as crossing the water.

Social anxiety, to me, is an invisible wall you build for yourself, but someone else has hidden the key. I have three friends in all the world, and all of them decided to adopt me. I have no idea how to make more or how to interact normally in public. I'm just glad I have that many"
"Atm I have to go to the city to buy something. You know that feeling you have in your stomach when you're afraid or nervous? Yeah I have that atm. Buying things is easy and I'm 19 years old, this shouldn't be a problem. It takes 30 minutes max. but I wasted most of the day already with being afraid. Add to that what everyone else said, it makes life unnecessarily complicated."
Imagine every conversation is like a job interview.
TIL I have social anxiety (I think) 
Bad
"Like you're being constantly rejected. 


Before anyone has even rejected you."
"Like you're in a group of people that are talking to each other but are staring at you but not talking to you, and when they do talk to you its a brief conversation and you can't do anything to continue it. Oh and when you feel comfortable enough to talk you better believe they won't hear you because you don't talk loud enough. Or if you are talking and tey say ""what?"" because they don't understand what you're saying you better hold tight because the cold sweat is enough to make you think that there is sweat spots all over your body. Fuck the list can go on, because social anxiety will fuck you so hard you feel comfort in isolation and that isolation is a great place to grow, cultivate and eat depression. "
"Supposedly the #1 fear of adults in the US is public speaking.  They're afraid of large numbers of people judging them, laughing at them, mocking their appearance or dress or manner of speaking, all the bad things that could happen.

Now imagine you were exactly that afraid when the audience was just one person."
I myself get real sweaty. Especially ass crack sweaty so I have to wear jeans all the time or I'll have a massive ass crack sweat patch in public. 
"You want do to do things, things that require talking to people & meeting people. But when the time comes there's the overwhelming sense of ""I don't want to do that"" even though you KNOW you really do. It sort of paralyzes you."
"It's fucking awful. You KNOW the things you are feeling are not true, but they still guide your entire being. You are in a constant struggle to undermine yourself and find reasons not to do things. It might rain, no place to park, too hot, I have to ....insert 1000  excuses. If you actually manage to do whatever you were going to do in public, you might as well be naked. You feel everyone is staring at you, wondering why you're saying stupid things, wearing stupid clothes, stupid hair, thinking you're too fat, etc... All you can think about is when will it end and God forbid someone actually talks to you. You just want to go home where it's safe...and dream about going outside without feeling the way you do. Medication helped me immensely. I don't really have it anymore, but that's how it felt. It's terrible."
Not that good to be honest.
"Someone has duct-taped your mouth shut. Also, they're asking you ""Why are you so quiet?"""
easier to talk on here 
Shit.
Making a phone call is sometimes like that first jump into a cold pool. 
"So my adrenaline kicks in but you know how it’s suppose to be fight or flight? Well there is a third reaction and that is to freeze and tense up so either the preverbal tiger thinks you’re dead already and leaves you or so it and just hurry up and kill you and get it over with. I get that third thing SOME of the time. Usually I’m fine, pretty normal. But when that happens it’s bad. I’m nervous, frozen and just hoping everyone thinks I’m dead and just goes away.  "
Fear. Just constant fear and trepidation of everything that goes about around where ever you go. Absolutely terrible feeling. 
I have social anxiety but when I am drunk for some weird reason I make everyone my friend.
"It feels like you want to go out and do things with friends. But right when you start getting ready to leave you get a string urge to pee that won't go away until you decide not to go out, or you force yourself to go because you know it's all in your head and once you get comfortable wherever you're going the feeling goes away."
Basically you regret everything you say right after you say it. Socializing is easier the older you get but that never really stops
I feel like I’m in everyone’s way and that I have to get to wherever I’m going asap so they all stop staring at me. 
"You worry that friends, family, strangers, anyone around you are judging you in some way. Do they think you’re annoying? Do they think you’re ugly? Are they looking down on you? Sometimes this fear drives itself into your head before going out and suddenly you feel incapable of stepping outside your room. Sometimes it bubbles up inside you while you’re with other people. You start twitching nervously, sweating, you start to lose track of what’s going on because you’re too busy panicking internally. Eventually you have to get out of there and go somewhere where you’re alone. Sometimes you just want to curl up, cover yourself up and put on a YouTube video, a TV show, anything that will take your mind off it. Anything that will help stop you thinking about yourself and everything you feel is wrong with you. Sometimes you cry. Sometimes you lie there wishing you didn’t exist. And then you have to try and cover it all up, internalise your feelings, go out and pretend that everything’s okay, because the world doesn’t slow down just because you’ve stopped."
Lol I thought this was just how people are and not a specific problem I have
Jittery. Like I'm on drugs. Being alone is my fix. But without it my eyes dart everywhere looking for somewhere i can hide and breathe
You hate yourself and think everyone else hates you too
It's a struggle to answer my phone and  I also have phases where If someone knocks Ill sneak to the living room and stand still and silent until they go away. its like paranoia and fear hit u in the gut and u can't breathe
"I'd like to share some pro's as there are a sea of cons....

For me social anxiety makes me appreciate a good social exchange way more than anyone else ever will. If I have a conversation with someone and my eye contact is solid, we're both smiling and connecting and I manage to say goodbye etc without missing a step then the feeling is incredible. I will always critically asses all communication I have with people and when on the rare occasion I find zero faults it's one of the best feelings in the world. To feel like a normal person and think that that person thinks Im a normal person also. So good.

Also Social Anxiety makes me appreciate the friends I do have who are patient with my issues so much more than I think other people do. I've seen extroverted people with no anxiety pick up and drop close friends like its nothing. My friends are far too valuable to ever do that.
"
Like warm apple pie.
Someone could be the nicest most pure hearted person ever and in the back of my mind I wonder how their gonna screw me over.
"Always feeling uneasy, convincing yourself you don't need to go out unless you really have to.
When you're out avoiding absolutely every single bit of eye contact, your heart races when you make eye contact. Constantly feeling that everybody is looking at you, judging you.
Seeing a crowd will give me the biggest fear, I'll double even triple my journey length to avoid a crowd. I get nervous sweaty heart starts pounding when walking past people.

Always turning down friend invites but I don't do well in a social setting, making up excuses so they don't think I'm weird. If I do turn up I can't stop thinking about the spilt second I can leave the place, the relief you get when you're finally isolated from everyone.

Never answering my phone even if it's someone I trust, I get the feeling of dread and can't shake the nerves so I never answer it, I'll wait for their text instead.
Can't talk to new people or meet new people without feeling like the most nervous person in the world so I avoid it entirely.

When a group of friends I trust are doing great something I don't mind but somebody new is there I'll make up an excuse.
Going to a my gf's sister's wedding was probably one of the most excruciating things I went through, you just feel all this pressure on you like the weight of the world on your shoulders so you just go and hide in the bathroom to get some relief.

I do every thing I can to avoid contact with someone, idle chit chat is possibly the worst thing ever, small talk will just make me feel uncomfortable.

Trying to order things such as drinks or anything, you'll run it through your head practicing it over and over and over so you don't make a single mistake and yet when you speak you know in your head you're coming off as nervous so then you sit there with your drink embarrassed running the scenario through your head thinking how dumb you looked and small situations like that can run on in your head to no stop.

The list goes on and it's not something I'd like to live with but I feel like  I manage and hide it well enough that most people don't think I have it because if they thought I had social anxiety it would make my brain run the scenario in my head that they're gonna ask me questions about it and that in turn makes me nervous and get more anxious, it's a viscous cycle and it seems there are plenty of people with it too!"

"What are you really terrified of? Heights? Spiders? Clowns? Imagine that paralyzing fear you feel, like if someone had a gun to your head happened when someone says hi to you on voice chat and you want to push a button to say hi back *but cant*."
"Have you ever seen that movie ""Meet the Parents"" starring Ben Stiller? My social anxiety makes me feel like I'm Greg Focker and everyone else is Jack Byrnes and his family. I walk away from most interactions feeling like I somehow let everyone else down or like someone else got the better of me. It frequently makes me terrified of speaking up and breaking the ice around new people. My anxiety is paired with a hefty dose of Impostor Syndrome as well. Your experience may vary."
"Everywhere you go, every single person is looking at you all of the time and they are thinking something negative about you but you don't know what. You're constantly so, so aware of yourself, policing yourself - where do you put your hands? is the rain heavy enough to put your umbrella up yet? is there something on your face? what are you doing right now that is wrong? don't draw attention to yourself, don't draw attention to yourself - that the only time you can ever properly relax is at home, alone, with the curtains closed. But even then... Hide if the doorbell rings. Duck if someone passes by the window. Double check the corridor is empty before you leave your flat."
"It can be okay once I get out in society. My issue is getting out. I can see something I’d like to do, for instance there is an open house today at a dance studio. I would like to go. I have some ideas. In the past I usually just done go. It’s hard to be single and not have any local friends. "
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh
"You know when you order a chicken sandwich without mayonnaise but they make it with mayonnaise? You have to pick the sandwich apart and salvage what you can and eat it because taking it back to the counter and asking for one without mayonnaise because you don't want to be difficult. Avoid confrontation even when confrontation isn't present.
 
Shoutout to the friends of mine who take my sandwiches back when they're made wrong. They're the real MVP's"
People smile at me I smile back and proceed analyze how I smiled and if I looked stupid for the next hour or I replay conversations I’ve just had with people over and over to see what I could have said or done differently I pretend I’m listening to music or I’m on the phone when walking through public places like malls to distract myself So I don’t think someone looked at me and have to analyze why they’d look at me for hours also if I don’t distract myself like that I’ll over analyze how I walk to the point I end up walking funny because I’m concentrating too hard on not waking funny 
I think I'd like to know what it's like NOT to have social anxiety. 
"The best explanation I've ever read:

You know that feeling of dread you get when you're driving along and a cop pulls out behind you?  Even if you're doing nothing wrong you suddenly become nervous and ultra self-conscious .Social anxiety is having that feeling all the time, and everyone is the cop."
The movie Eighth Grade by Bo Burnham gets this so perfectly
"Every moment you want to talk in public, you fear that youll offend someone, youll lose friends, nobody will like you. Anytime a friend becomes even lightly offended by something you have said, you feel as if you ruined a friendship (and I mean in a way thats recoverable).

You actually dread talking, even with a close group, you cant cut loose with people. You never give your opinion and you generally just go along with the crowd because of a fear of having your ideas rejected and people stop liking you instantly.

And its insanely hard to dig yourself out of that hole."
"I turn really red when I'm embarrassed, so on top of having social anxiety I also have a big visual indicator broadcasting my internal emotions while simultaneously drawing everyone's attention. 

*Brain* ""I noticed you're feeling a little uneasy. LETS MAKE SURE EVERYONE KNOWS"""
"I don't always have it, but when I have a panic attack in public, like work or with friends, it's completely numbing. It's like that scene in movies where people are talking around you but you cant here them and it all sounds like mumbles. You start feeling a sense of dread, like something is chasing you, your head starts to feel constricted, and you just wanna go hide and scream. Since you can't (especially me because I'm a manager of my department) your breathing gets really heavy and sometimes I start sweating. It's not a pleasant experience and I get myself to sit down as soon as I can. "
"I have trouble being able to talk to anyone I’m even slightly uncomfortable with. Even though I’m really articulate, I second guess every word that leaves my mouth. And I’ll think about conversations days after having them "
"As I have aged, my SA has changed a lot and turned me more isolated than I had been when this first hit in my early 20's, took a break, then hit really hard around my early 30's and now just hangs out sucking the life out of me.

It feels shameful/guilt inducing when you have a spouse who is incredibly fun and social and craves being social and wants to go be social with you present but you'd rather be hit by a train...so your supportive spouse avoids social outings to stick by you and support you. That sucks a lot. 

It feels scary. Going into stores or busy ANYWHERE without a clear plan or direction makes me stress sweat and often triggers painful migraines. ""I don't know these people. People are horrible and selfish. People have no boundaries or respect for others. Why are these people so fucking loud?""...this is my constant internal narrative. I must have a plan and get in and out and keep my head down. And when I'm out with my teen daughter I have to hide it all. I don't want her incredibly sunny, optimistic, friendly disposition to be tainted by my toxic SA, so that's exhausting and very hard to do. She gets annoyed with me at times. 

It feels awkward when I need to be social with the parents of my teens friends and I can't do it so they all likely think I'm an asshole. I'm not. I just don't know how to people without fear of saying stupid things and being alienated.

It is sad a lot. I don't ""click"" with others ever. It is isolating. It makes me hate other humans for various reasons. I have a very small handful of people I speak to regularly...maybe 5...and they are family or work with my son so they know me well. If I go anywhere it is mostly alone or with my disabled son. I can focus solely on him in public and block a lot of shit out which is oddly kind of nice.

TL;dr It is a fucking exhausting battle every single second of the day. I wouldn't wish it on anyone."
I cried once during a new years eve party with friends because i tried to dance with a girl...
"You're on the bus going to a Christmas party you've been invited to...You're talking to a friend on the phone and tell them you could just stay on the bus and go home...She tells you to go to the party and have fun...

You get to the party and realize it's a bigger crowd than just the people that invited you. Instead of 20 or so people you know, you're now amongst 200 people, most you don't know, but who all know each other.

Every 20 minutes you sneak off to the far stall of the bathroom just to take 20 minutes to put your brain back together to walk out there and deal with the next 20 minutes. People think you have a small bladder or ""broke the seal"".  Really, you just can't handle being this close to so many strangers.

You try to have fun, you really do, but you're constantly wondering when the appropriate time to leave is.  That voice gets louder. Soon, you're no longer trying to have fun. Your demeanor changes. People begin to notice the change. They don't say anything, they just go talk to other people.

You go back to that stall in the bathroom for 20 minutes...You come out and overhear someone commenting they think you might have a coke problem.  If you did *that* much coke,  you'd probably be the life of the party...

Finally, the appropriate time to leave has come. You say your goodbyes to the few people still around you...The rest have sought conversation elsewhere. You make a last trip to the washroom, then sneak out the back and hail a cab.  You get home, shower, crawl into your own bed, and, for the first time in 8 hours, feel comfortable and safe."
"I use to have a hard time just talking to people. That changed after I started working retail. I got good at small talk, so that part doesn't bother me anymore.

However, as soon as I hit off with another person, I realize it, and boom! All my self-confidence goes out the window and suddenly become tongue tied and hey look I suddenly have to get going..."
It feels like you have paranoia. Like you can't trust anybody.
"Horrible. You feel like a freak. For example, I dream about being able to openly communicate with people and be this social butterfly and yet I know I'll never be able to do that. I've tried to get over it and I just can't, so I accepted I'll always be socially awkward.

Every moment in which there are people around I feel like I'm supposed to talk to them or something but don't know what to say. I can never relax around people even if it's not a social situation. For example, I I go to the library I can't do my work properly because I'm surrounded by people the whole time. "
Feels bad man
"Everything you say: stupid. 
Every move you make: awkward.
Everyone around you: judgement.
"
"You're convinced that everyone who lays eyes on you instantly and actively hates your guts. Every time a car passes you when you're out walking you're ready for them to scream at you. Passing someone on the sidewalk inspires swift and sweaty panic. Your hands get hot, so hot, and if you're not careful your heart may explode. Or so my anxiety told me.

Help is available. Unless you're a neo-Nazi. In that case you deserve every bit of it."
When you can physically feel your heart get heavy and ache. 
"I can’t stand eye contact. I hate having to make small chat with people because I feel so out of place.

Calling people or talking to strangers causes me to shut down. I go into my shell and it takes me a long time to get out.

I feel like whenever I do something, people are all judging me even though I know they aren’t.

If I am in a big room, I try to be as far away from the center as possible. 

If I am holding something that needs to be thrown away, I will wait for someone else to go so everyone doesn’t look at just me.

One of the biggest things is that I like to have something with me to keep my hands full.  Whether it be a book or my purse strap. It makes me feel grounded and reminds me of where I am.

I boarder close to Aspergers Syndrome of Social Anxiety which is why mine can be more severe or I might have weird ticks to deal with things. 

It’s a day to day thing that I just have to deal with. Luckily now I am dealing really well."
"There’s a huge barrier of wanting to talking to someone and actually talking to them. But, for me at least, when you start talking to them, the conversation just flows. That’s the real problem for me, just getting over that barrier."
Wanting to do or say something interesting but deciding against it for fear of what others would say or think if they knew.
"Feels like everyone is looking at you everywhere you go, and judging every little thing that you are doing, including your posture and even walking pace"
"The process for me (both social anxiety an introversion...fun):

* get asked to go to event - heart rate increases slightly and a feeling not quite of panic, but related.  Shake off feeling long enough to agree to go.

* 5-10 minutes until time to leave for event - feeling antsy/anxious, start regretting agreeing to go.

* on the way to event - starting to feel dread abut being around more than a handful of people at a time.

* at event - If I am there by myself, words have a hard time leaving my throat (feels like it closes every time I try to speak).  If I am there with at least one person I know, thoughts going through my head too fast to process, but having someone else to carry on the conversation while I pull thoughts together definitely helps me just seem quiet instead of internally screaming and running in circles.

* after event - closer to home I get, the less panicked I feel, but am left so drained that I'm not going to get anything else done that day.  Usually end up doing something to distract myself until I'm thinking at a ""normal level"" again.


I always hate myself for agreeing to go, but continue to do so hoping that it will eventually get better.  If it's a small enough group, though, it's only as bad as the first day at a new job.  I might feel awkward as hell and my brain might decide to randomly forget a few things in the moment, but I'm relatively functional in conversation."
"You want to socialize but you just don't know how to. I force myself to go to events and I stand there trying to think up of words to say and instantly regret going and spend my time trying to calculate a way to go home without seeming rude.

I talk and feel like I'm stuttering. I go to public places and on a really bad day if there's too many people around I cling to my husband like a very shy kid who wants to leave. 

Now I just sit there quietly and pray I'm in the presence of people who don't mind the quiet and that's me socializing."
"Never feeling like you truly belong. You're out of place. You're sticking out like a sore thumb. Pretending as best you can, but it's as clear as day. You check last week's text for the 15th time in an effort to avoid any further social interaction. Surely they've noticed by now. No one mentions it though. They ignore it, and you out of pity. You're genuinely thankful for it, as the last thing you need is being talked to in a patronizing way like you were 5 again. You overthink your every move, which was obviously wrong as soon as you actually do it. You're not quite sure where else you'd rather be, you just know that anywhere would be better than here. Feels like you are holding your breath the entire time, yet again trying to hide it, as to not ruin the night any further. You're trying as best you can, but it's hard, really hard. Every second feels like you're getting ever so closer to an unavoidable panic attack. Eventually you can't take it anymore, desperately wanting to leave so you can figuratively gasp for air you bolt mid-conversation to seek relief. Finally, you can breath again, but soon begin feel that creeping menace inching it's way back to your chest. You'll have to explain why you left...

Fuck."
It's like you have committed a terrible crime and anyone you talk to might figure out your crime and punish you with all kinds of pain and death if you use the wrong words or say the wrong things or do the wrong things or act in a wrong way. So you better really watch how you act around people in order to not expose your evil true self. 
the worst thing ever
"Like when you make eye contact with anyone it feels like a shock in your mind. Sometimes I get paranoid thoughts, like they hate me omg they hate me. It only happens with groups of people I don’t know. Walking down the street I avoid eye contact cuz of the shock thing. I try to push through it at social gatherings and it gets to the point where I introduce myself alright but in conversations I feel like my head is detached from my body or like I’m floating. Kinda a cool feeling but sometimes I forget what I’m talking about half way through a sentence or completely screw up a simple sentence. In a way it’s like having an awkward crush on everyone without actually liking them lol.  Having a real crush is like a step up from that where I can’t make eye contact and start hyperventilating. Lol I find it funny almost how awkward I get. It’s important to try to push through it tho, cuz being a weirdo the first times you meet someone is better than being alone! Still workin on the whole general anxiety but social anxiety sucks monkey dick for sure."
Like everyone around you is speaking in a language you can't understand.  
You’re constantly second-guessing yourself and break down when you don’t know what to do.
"So many good responses. I just want to add one thing:

During a conversation with a new face, I'll think constantly about what I should say next to make a good impression. It's a constant review process. ""No that's too weird. No they'll think I'm a nut.""

It makes conversing really difficult. All that thinking means I'm not really listening. It's kinda like narcissism but with a different motivation. ""I don't want this person to be offended by me"" versus ""I'm the only person that matters."""
"I make plans, don't want to go because it's in public, and debate for 2 weeks whether it's worth it. I feel the same either way, if I don't go I feel like I really wanted to. If I don't go, I feel like I made a mistake."
"At the age of 35 I still cannot enjoy myself at all in big crowds of people unless I am drunk or high. Forget about dancing or anything that requires you to ""let go"", every move feels like it's being scrutinised by everyone in the room.

Think of it as being supremely focused on the result of your actions and statements rather than just enjoying the actions and statements in themselves. If you are concerned how a small group (or even one person) will react to what you do, imagine how much that is dialled up in a crowd..."
normal people are weird and scary
"It is like I am having a heart attack, but I know/think it ""just"" anxiety."
"For me it was walking into a room and feeling like everybody stopped to look up and judge me. I felt like everywhere I went people were looking at me and thinking I shouldn’t be there. I know it’s irrational but I literally get fight or flight like feelings, heart pounding, sweaty af, I can’t look at you in the eye if you talk to me so if you’re explaining something, I’m more focused on trying not to look stupid so my eyes wonder off and that person stops talking- I snap back and realize I’m totally being weird because I’m trying so hard- NOT TO be weird. Also, feeling guilty and apologizing about every question or comment I have, never feeling good enough for anybody’s attention so I apologize. It’s exhausting. Zoloft helps a ton- it’s like I’m a whole different person. "
"You know it’s irrational but that actually can make it worse. You feel like you shouldn’t go to events because you think people don’t want you there. When you do go you feel so out of place and uncomfortable that it’s almost a physical sensation. You’re so self conscious about your clothes, height, how you hold your drink, how you open doors, like really small things that you know no one is watching but you feel like everyone is paying attention anyway.  You always try to find ways to be alone in social situations, hiding in the bathroom or going outside for some air. "
"Being in public makes me feel like I'm in a weird fugue state. Like, I feel almost light headed but not really and that I have to keep moving and stay focused on what I went outside to do."
"The feeling you get when you almost fall backwards off the stairs, and then don’t, over and over and over again, even though you know you aren’t going to fall. "
Assuming you're being a hassle and everyone regrets you being in their presence 
Had to leave a party because I was genuinely horrified that the cops were gonna get called. It was in a town house complex with other neighbors on a Sunday night. Came back later tho but then left again and called it a night.
"Like [this](https://imgur.com/pU1hGG8)!

(I drew a picture of it for Inktober last year.  I'm outside the bar, paralyzed with fear, thinking: ""Do I look okay? Am I early? Am I late? I wish \[friends\] were here. Does this shirt look okay? Who's here? Jesus, I should have worn concealer on my cheeks instead of foundation, I'm blushing like crazy. What if they only invited me to be polite and don't actually want me here? If nothing else, I'll get a drink.  What if it's too loud? What if I hear something wrong and say something dumb? I could still turn around and go home. I should have pregamed. I really hope someone cool is here, or at least someone who will try to include me.  Once I open the door, I can't turn around..."")

**Serious note:** If you feel like this too, counseling can help. It has helped me. If your hangup comes from not understanding the people around you, take a hearing test. My hearing aids were just as helpful as cognitive behavioral therapy. Have courage, and know you’re not alone.  "
Always scared whenever i'm talking to someone new. Like shaking. And also i can't have anyone walk close behind me because i picture all the ways they could kill me at that time. So i calmly let them pass me as i have an internal panic attack.
Imagine the feeling you have when you're having a nightmare. Like how you're whole mind and body is just going haywire and when you wake up and your heart is galloping out of your chest and you feel hot and sweaty and scared for not really any reason. 
"I always find its a wierd paradox of feeling incredibly exposed (in public) and yet utterly alone and unrelatable, especially if people are giving me a hard time, even if it's not necessarily malicious.  You freeze up and you can't just say something diffusing or witty back.  It's so hard to resolve and it's self-perpetuating."
"It’s rough. I used to stay in my room for days without talking to people and when I would finally try to get out and be social, I’d stall by obsessing with my hair or changing clothes or locking and unlocking the door. I’ve spent my life surrounded my classmates and coworkers I find interesting and would love to be friends with but can never seem to talk to. You just spend your life alone in a crowded room. "
"For me its like i want to go to places but i feel like people will hate me.

This started because everybody in school hated me so i wouldn't talk to anyone"
"I was homeschooled for three years and didn’t step outside for a full one. I was terrified of my own family, and rarely left my room for fear of seeing them. "
Fuckin SUCKS.
"It's being worried when there's more than a few people around, even close friends. It's getting nervous in the checkout line because you might fumble your change and the complete stranger behind you that you'll never see again might judge. 

It's sweaty palms and shaking hands when waiting for your tinder date to show up. (Literally doing breathing exercises in my car right now waiting for her to show up. Heart is racing and she's 5 minutes late so maybe she hates me?) That's what it's like. 

You hold on tight to the reasoning that no one really gives a shit and that you're being ridiculous, but holy mother of god if you let your brain go with it... It's nuts."
"It's suffocating. Knowing how irrational your mindset is and that people don't care as much as you think you do, but being unable to dispell that (on top of feeling guilty for paradoxically holding yourself as more important than others at the same time). There's a lot of bitterness on missed opportunities, be it friends or networking or jobs because I am so deathly afraid of being judged and criticized for every mistake I might make. I can't even talk anonymously online because I am afraid of people judging me anyway.  

And there's the persistent fantasy of just imagining yourself surrounded by friends you want to have but can't."
"You feel out of place, like everyone in a friend group is way better than you, and you want to dissapear as soon as posible. 

You want to go out, take a walk, but when you go for it (after a very long discussion with yourself about not going out) you feel like all the people around you is drilling your head with their looks. Obviously no one is watching you or cares for you but you feel like everyones is talking about how you look, the way you walk, and the worst is when you see people laughing, you think that they are laughing of you. Oh, and that torture when you see good looking people, with clean faces, and you think that you should be like them, but you cant. that shit hurts.

If you have acne, like me, you always get ashamed of your face, and you really don't want to go out, or to talk to people, you just want to stay at home. If you eventually go out is because something really really important, but if there is not a good reason, you prefer so stay inside your house. 

It's a fucking nightmare living like this."
"It sucks.

Every action, every word, every mistake causes insane amounts of anxiety. You constantly over-analyze every situation, which is exhausting. There were a few times where I legit cried before giving a presentation in class and once where I threw up before heading to a job because I was so scared. Even giving a simple opinion is terrifying.

It’s also isolating. You might want to go out and meet people but you’re too scared of what they might say/do/think to take any action. You’re always a bystander or someone on the sidelines. You’re just always afraid of doing/saying something wrong, annoying/pissing off people around you, and embarrassing yourself.

I’ve heard it compared to hearing boss music in a game but never seeing the boss itself. You’re on edge all the time, even when there’s no real reason for it. So yeah, it sucks."
Constant fear of being judged. Automatically assuming that you'll ruin anybody's day just by being there. Assume that everyone around you is wishing you'd go away but is just too nice to say it. Crowds are all staring at you. You are in the way. 
"Here's a recent example of what my life is like with social anxiety.

I sent someone a text the other day. It was pretty simple, just thanking them for something. It took me several hours to write and I went through multiple drafts. I eventually managed to come up with something I thought was passable (and by passable I mean *normal*, I'm always asking myself if what I'm doing is normal). Then I literally left my phone in another room because I couldn't stand to even be around it.

Eventually, I checked and they replied. My next reply took several hours. I gave up at several points. I pulled up a thesaurus. 

Anyway, I sent the reply and the conversation looks like a perfectly normal, average back and forth. But I fucking hate myself for it. I hate that it's on my phone. I hate that I sent it in the first place. I wish they had just ignored me. 

"
"You want to go out but the second you step out of your house you just want to go back but can't cause it's too late. I don't know if I have social anxiety since I have...a good amount of friends (I'm not popular or anything, I just happen to be able to talk to plenty of friends) but when someone invites me to a party or to hang out with someone else outside my friend's circle it's an instant nope. 
I have this friend who parties hard a lot so idk how we ended up being super close friends. She always tells me to go to parties at her house but I just can't cause I'm afraid of being stuck there doing nothing. It's weird"
"Go somewhere and find a large staircase that you have never walked up before.

Now, put on a blindfold don't hold the railing (though stay close to it to catch yourself. Try to be safe) and walk up the staircase.

If you miss a step, or step higher at the end expecting to hit a step, that momentary panic where you may fall if you don't react fast enough, that feeling, is similar to anxiety. Anxiety just lasts significantly longer.

Social Anxiety is that feeling, triggered when around people, be them friends or strangers. It's the feeling that you can make one mistake, be it in a motion or a sentence, and you'll get hurt, like if you fell flat on your face at the top of the steps. Sometimes, you even feel like you'll keep sliding down those stairs if you make any mistake.

Obviously, you start to want to get off the staircase pretty quick. You avoid stairs at any cost, taking the long way, because you know (or at least you feel like) you're safe if you do it that way.

But it sure would be a lot faster if you could just go up the stairs, and it would be much easier than the longer trek you take to avoid them. You think about that sometimes, and may have even done the math on how much faster going up those stairs would be for you.

Sometimes, you try to go up the stairs, when you're feeling stronger, and you start out kind of okay, but towards the middle, you start thinking really hard about slipping. You grip the railing tighter, but your hands are sweaty, and your grip isn't very stable. The pulse rises, you start to feel your fight or flight instinct kick in, but if you listen to it and run in either direction, then you increase the risk of falling by a ton, and you're very uncomfortably aware of that.

Now, imagine that feeling, but at any social gathering. You don't go out normally, but your co-workers pushed you til you caved. You didn't necessarily *not* want to go, but you don't feel right about going, either, but it's okay. Today, you feel stronger, right? 

The further into the night you get, the more you start to think about how you don't really want to be here. That your co-workers aren't really talking to you very much, as if maybe they didn't really want you to come with. That you have been glued to your phone as much as you could, trying to scroll through social media to be less uncomfortable, but your hands are getting sweaty because you've been holding your phone for so long. Your grip isn't very stable.

You think about leaving, but you expect you'll get asked why, or that they'll beg you to stay. You can't bring yourself to listen to that, because you don't have the heart to say, ""I just don't want to be here."" If they pull that, your pulse will rise, and you worry that you'll lose your cool. You decide you can't tell them you want to leave, but you can't just vanish, because they'll ask you later, and then the spotlight would be on you, and you'd be standing in the middle of the staircase again, unable to run when you feel unsafe, because running makes it worse, stranded in a spot where you either have to finish what you started, or carefully sneak backward, all while feeling like you could fall and hurt yourself at any moment.

And all you wanted was to go up the damn stairs."
"Like you have so much to say, but everyone is talking too fast, changing the subject too quickly, and when your input is asked.. you draw a blank because they don't really care about what you say, they're just being polite, right?

It feels like being so prepared for the first day of class. A class you've been looking forward to taking. You even got all the good supplies, no cheap binders or pencils here. Last night, you carefully, meticulously picked out your outfit for today. You got in the parking lot 45 minutes early. You stand outside the classroom 15 minutes early, but is it too early to go in? Are you even at the right room? People start going in. Now you're standing here too long. You look lost. So stare at your phone, hope to look like you're waiting on someone. 5 minutes until class starts. All the good seats are gone, but you still can't move your feet. What if its not the right room? What if you're not prepared? What if you're too prepared? You hear class start. You stand there, waiting outside the door, just to hear the class name. It is the right class, but now it's too late. So you stand there, listening from outside, embarrassed tears forming. 

Its wanting to go to a party at a friend's house, with all your other friends. You all work together, you have so much fun at work with them. You plan all week what to wear, how early to leave. But that night, you lay on your couch, trying to thinkof some believable excuse for this time. You don't even watch tv or play your favorite video game. You just lay there, staring at facebook and instagram and snapchat, seeing how fun your friends are having. Wishing you could be part of it all, knowing you had a chance to.  "
Frustrating is the summary. You wanna get to know people but there’s a huge road bloc in you mind stoppping you. Overthinking social events is horrible and it’s so hard to push yourself to get over fears bc of it

I prefer a one to one talk more usually at parties because they I feel connect more but with my usual social anxiety, I guess I never realised that even sitting in a group can be a nice bonding experience if you're participating.  
I've seen a lot of levels to social anxiety and a lot of people I know have it, the thing is you just double-triple think everything before saying it out? Sometimes you have something nice to add to the topic and you cannot because you keep questioning and thinking that it is stupid, so you end up keeping it to yourself and end up not talking. "

"I suffer from General Anxiety Disorder, with a component of Social Anxiety to it, so I would love other sufferers input on this.

For me being out and about suffering from anxiety is one thing; I try and be sociable but I do find it hard (if not impossible) to connect with new people; I'm awkward around people I'm not familiar with, find it hard to initiate a meaningful conversation. However, actual anxiety attacks are a whole different thing. I'm very lucky that my close friends, for whom I'm usually going out to be with and support (going to their birthdays, weddings, performances, etc), know and understand my condition so they can help. But this really isn't even the worst of it, since I can get myself home safely and have medication that works in reactive time-frame, this becomes the beginning of a longer and more insidious fight. The cycle isn't so simple as go out, have an attack, go home, get meds, be fine in the morning. There is a mental and physical exhaustion that comes with this that lingers for *days*.

Again this may just be me, but it's a part of anxiety I hear far too few people talk about. And as such, I would appreciate any other peoples input, insights, and expereinces on this.

Many thanks to anyone who reads and/or replies. Keep strong, and remember as best you can when things are rough, *it's all going to be ok* :)"

"Oh, let’s go do something tonight!


...can I go home yet?"
You know how you get kinda nervous if you're talking to a  superior or someone you find attractive? Multiply that times ten except your just trying to buy a coffee. 
Staying quiet the majority of a conversation only to mutter the wrong words and make a mess of yourself
"""Don't speak until you're spoken to"" is my unfortunate motto - and I have so much to say.

I want to get out and live my life, but the fear of bumping into people hinders me every step of the way. What if I see people that I know and it's awkward? What if everyone has someone to hang out with and I'll be left alone? What if my rosacea flares up and I make a test out of myself? 

Overthinking all interactions and re-evaluating all conversations to check if your initial impression was correct, or if maybe the meaning was completely different.

TL;DR - there's so much more to it, but in a nutshell, it's hell.
"
It feels like showing up late to the first day of summer camp and everyone has started to play a “get to know you game” without you and you don’t know the rules so you’re just winging it
"It's tough. You don't have any control. It literally feels like everyone is looking at you at all times and judging you heavily. You feel so out of place and when I was in HS people would always ask y I was quiet all the time, or be like ""holy shit you can talk!?"" I don't have an answer y I'm like this. It's why I don't always go out or party whatever you want to call it. Have a conversation with someone is like being in a battle. Talking to people feels more forced than it does being enjoyable. I guess that's why I don't go on social media because Idk how to talk to people. As far as I can remember I've had this issue my whole life and it affected me most in elementary school because I was most vulnerable. Maybe that's y I feel like it's gotten worse for me because of past experiences traumatized my present. All I can do I guess is just be happy about the little things I have. And remember everything is temporary."
"That everyone is constantly judging every little thing I do, I can be in a room of close friends that I've had for years and feel out of place and that they don't like me, always wanting to speak my mind and talk about my interests but too afraid to, and if i do have the courage to I'm over thinking everything I said for the next week."

Don’t know what to do at this point, I have fours hours to just sit here.

Afraid of commenting on Reddit in fear of people judging you 
"Social anxiety is kinda weird because you can still have it even being pretty confident in yourself

It just seems like a massive fear of being judged poorly, having people view you like an idiot more than anything. Even once you accept that fact and go out and get more experience, youll still get that tight grip in your chest even if you go through a conversation flawlessly

Its a bitch you learn to live with"
my main thing is eye contact. i struggle to keep eye contact and if i try to i end up looking all over someones face. then i think once its finished that person thins im a fucking idiot
bad
"More emotionally and mentally taxing than you may think. I think one of the best descriptors for how I feel in many social situations is akin to that feeling when you finally start to relax, and then you remember you forgot something extremely important/remember you didn't do an assignment 5 minutes before the deadline/plane takes off and you remember you left the stove on. That level of confusion, anxiety, shock, fear, etc. just prolonged."
"I have GAD and I tend to sweat. A lot. Which is very embarrassing. I get this way typically in stores and larger crowds, which is a bit silly to me because I'm not interacting with people in either situations. Sitting for a few minutes and just observing people tends to help me, just so I have this understanding that people aren't staring at me or judging me while buying my groceries. 

When I met my current boyfriend, I was so nervous it took me a couple dates to really even look him in the eyes or talk much, just because I get this overwhelming feeling of self doubt every time I open my mouth. "
Crippling.
"It feels like theres something fundamentally wrong with me. I am never really interacting with people. Organic socializing is something i can occasionally experience but every social meeting is going to be a mental gauntlet where i have to concentrate on what they say and i have to think of something to say back to them. Its easier with people I've known for a long time but with casual friends you develop a habit of needing an inventory of shit to say to keep the flow of conversation flowing. Its hell when you're at a gathering and there are people you don't know well and you're adrift with no easy pieces of conversation to jump to. 

Even with friends you've known for years you're always outside of interactions trying to make them sincere. My housemate is overworked right now and it took a lot of mental energy to give her a hug and make her a cup of coffee, constantly doubting whether it was weird socially to be that selfless. 

Add on the cumulative neverending memories of failed social interactions that are soley remembered by you and no one else that haunt you and reinforce that you are useless and not normal like everyone else.

Even when you make progress and work on being more social that means more challenges as you encounter socially dominant people who are like an interrogation on whether you should be allowed to mix with polite company.

But we persevere. Knowing how hard it is to interact with others makes it easier to choose to be with the people that make us feel normal. We're more selfless. I went to buy medicine for my housemate on my birthday cause it was the right thing to do. I took in a friend at 2am because they felt uncomfortable at a party and needed a safe space. I've had a friend with mental illness tell me i made them feel normal because i took them seriously. Its not easy but when you suck at the superficial socializing you get better at the stuff that isnt superficial. Its not healthy to be more comfortable with unpleasant topics of conversation but its very grounding.

Tldr social anxiety puts you outside the crowd, wishing you were inside but you can't make yourself feel welcome the same way people with depression can't make themselves feel happy."
"I would love to spend time with the people I love and laugh and have fun. However, as soon as we go out I get quiet, feel as if no one wants me there and that I’m a Debbie downer. My mind instantly makes me feel like I don’t deserve to go out and be with them or have fun for that matter. It’s honestly mentally exhausting. "
"You know that tension and sense of dread you feel when you're watching a movie and the normally-uptight character is finally letting their guard down, making a friend, falling in love, maybe smiling or happy for the first time in the whole movie, and you just KNOW something awful is about to happen to them? It's basically that, only about yourself. Makes it hard to ever be in the moment. "
Pretty awful 
"I’m an extrovert with social anxiety.

That has to sound like the biggest oxymoron ever, but the two are not mutually exclusive. I love being able to hang out with friends but at the same time I’m so afraid of everything I do that might possible make them dislike me. I’ll contact friends about things I did weeks ago to apologize because I realize it could have been misconstrued the wrong way, then realize they forgot completely about it, and feel they hate me even more now because I’m so fucking weird as to call someone worrying about what they didn’t give a second thought to.

My anxiety typically manifests as me believing everyone else hates me. At the same time, I know these thoughts are irrational. But it’s like this voice, screaming in the back of my mind and eventually I’ll take something the wrong way and go into a full blown panic attack, because “the voice was right”. It’s really pitiful and honestly leads to me agreeing that everyone should hate me.

And though all this, you will never see me curl up into a ball and die. I’m just like all of you, on the surface at least. I’ve had my entire life to practice faking happiness, because I know if I don’t my weaknesses will only make me seem worse. I’ll have a panic attack and smile to people’s faces, but as soon as they stop watching I’ll hyperventilate.

So that’s my story. I’m a crippled disabled mess internally that’s barely able to hold on to my own sanity."
It sucks :(
Life is a series of awkward interactions.
"I want to be out and having fun, but I hate being the first to say hi. Once you get to know, I’m all over than damn place though, I just have a hard time actually going out and doing shit. Just feel awkward and self conscious."
"Volunteered to work a political campaign while drunk (social anxiety level zero) and shocked to get a phone call from them. Said yes to helping with the phones. Day comes around and there is NO FUCKING WAY I’m driving into the city (people in cars) going into a strange building, meeting strangers, cold calling more strangers. Oh my God no. Terrifying. I really care about the candidate. I just...can’t. "
Not great
It feels as if people are cold and unapproachable. It's always refreshing to meet someone who will go out of their way to be your friend.
"I have a very minor version of it, I think. And not to downplay others who actually have it, it's terrible and I wish you all the best, this is my anecdotal perspective.

Imagine thinking you never get invited out with friends, not because of you not making an effort, but because they're NOT you're friends. They pretend to be your friends because they pity you, and feel bad because you're awkward. Add to the fact that that never message you or contact you, due to you not talking to them, but you're mind spins it in a way of self critique, making you the reason they're not, not you're own inability to act (if that makes any sense?)

""Are they not talking with me because they don't like me? Why would they talk to.menin the first place? They would tell me if they didn't want to, wouldn't they???*

Then imagine finally getting around to hang out with them, only to pace around your house waiting for your ride, counting down the minutes and getting worried every half a minute they're later than they said;

""Are they coming? Did they cancel? I should check! No don't be stupid you're fine! But what if they got in an accident!?""

All these, even the extreme ones race through your mind all the while you're sweaty, red and overall uncomfortable, then they're here, so you get in the car and your mentally better, but you're sweaty, uncomfortable etc which only makes you think more of what they think of you.

It's honestly one of if not the most vicious of cycles I can think of. It's taxing to, put it mildly.

Edit: I've realized this is super jumbled and borderline incoherent... Sorry y'all."

"It's right up there next to cancer on ""Things I Never Ever Want to Have a Crippling Amount Of"""
"Mine has always seemed to stem from a fear of messing up social interactions. I've always been a man of few words and never understood what people got out of conversation unless it had real meaning behind it and when it comes to 'chit-chat' I have never learned to be able to do it.  It has caused a great many awkward silences in conversation, so many that I dread entering conversation and when I do, I'm more worried about having something to say than 'enjoying' connecting with someone.  This led to a fear of even messing up general greetings in passing such that I shut myself away at University and failed before finishing it due to not attending lectures.  The strangest thing I find even now, is I never knew or recognised I had it.  Perhaps due to being too proud to admit I had a weakness, perhaps due to not knowing it was a 'thing'.  Anyway, I'm 36 now and have picked up some coping mechanisms along the way but will always dread even the thought of conversation with people I don't know well...which is a vicious circle as you can't get to know someone well without conversation. Anyway best of luck all.(perhaps this was ironically too long for a man of few words so thank you if you got to the end!)"
Racing thoughts that make interacting with people zero fun whatsoever (best case) or trigger panic attacks (worst case). 
Like literally every second you are in an interview for your dream job that you don’t feel you’ve prepared enough for and you feel slightly sick. 
A sense of doubt surrounds everyone and everything in your life
"I experience elevated heart rate, sometimes sweating, and if I'm going to have to speak to someone I rehearse my statement in my mind over and over beforehand. Happens every time I am about to order at a drive-thru.  "
"The best way I can explain it is for you to think about someone you idolized or had a huge crush on, someone you were terrified to try to talk to. Think about the stress involved in trying to have a conversation with them. How in your own mind you would be screaming ""FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T FUCK THIS UP SOMEHOW."" Think about how much tripping over a single word would bother you. You would assume the worst, ""oh god they think I'm an idiot now."" 

That voice in the back of your head screaming negativity at you never shuts up, and you have to form your thoughts while trying to push that voice aside. It's like trying to speak while someone is talking over you, except it's happening in your brain.

Apply that to literally every conversation with anyone you aren't already really comfortable around.

Every new person is a new chance to be seen as something negative. You don't ""fit"" in hardly any situations. Fish out of the fucking water all the fucking time. The logical part of your mind can say ""dude, it's not a big deal, nobody actually cares enough to jump to that much of a negative conclusion"" but your logical self isn't doing the driving. It's a feeling, and there are very few ways to shake it, in my experience.

You get so worked up and so bent out of shape that when it comes time to actually interact with people, it's bound it be awkward. 

It. Fucking. Sucks. 

Given the choice, I will very often choose solitude over the stress involved with trying to go out and meet new people. Do I wish I had more of a social life? Hell yes. It just doesn't feel like a realistic goal."
"Normal things that you used to do without thinking suddenly become the worst thing imaginable and it gnaws at you all the time. A little bit nauseous, slightly faster heart rate and your brain just puts you into ""brace for impact"" mode. For example, something happened recently that affected the way i go home from work (comment off the neighbor about some bullshit). I used to be ok with it, but at the moment i dread going home. I start to panic the closer i get and start to feel sick. I dont know where its come from but its like i just can't cope with going into the house. Once.i'm through the door, i'm fine."
"I love parties and hanging out but anytime the attention is focused on me I get hugely uncomfortable and want to get the heat and pressure off of me. It’s really depressing because people will get disinterested in you and forget you, when all you want is friends and to have a good time. "
Awful
"Mostly, it's just being annoyed when I accidentally go out on busy days like weekends. I work third shift so avoiding people is pretty easy usually.


The worst part is never being able to ask a girl out. I'd just embarrass myself by having a panic attack in front of her. So I'm chronically single..."
"When going out, I will stay in my car and wait inside until I get brave enough to be seen. It can be a half hour sometimes. And sometimes I just change my mind about going out and go home."
Have you seen the movie Eighth Grade yet? The pool scene sums it up well. 
"I would like to type somethig for this, but i'm to scared about the consequences and backlash."
"Go outside, see people, decide to man up and go outside anyways, trip on your way out the door and literally nobody sees it but your 99% sure everyone saw it, go back inside for another week. "
Go punch yourself in the solar plexus in the freezing cold now hold it all in without showing symptoms. Now you know
"I probably have a bit of a different experience to a lot of people with social anxiety, because I'm also quite extroverted. 

I am very sensitive to other people and how they act around me. Especially strangers. 

I get two main stages, the first one is mild/moderate anxiety which happens mostly if I'm talking to a complete stranger, someone I don't know well or going to a place I have never been before. Or if I end up 'triggered' which honestly rarely happens happens but there are certain topics related to abuse that even if I'm with people who I feel comfortable with, I'm like instantly transported into anxiety and on edge.   
I get jittery, almost as if I've drunk a shit load of coffee or taken too much of my inhaler. I fidget and mess with things to try to distract my mind but it's almost as if I can't sit still, my hands shake, I will either talk way too much and ramble a lot. I just feel very on edge, a little bit uneasy. Normally after a while I'll get more comfortable and calm down. However sometimes it turns into more severe anxiety. 

I normally get really severe anxiety which normally happens if someone has said something unnecessarily mean, if I get the feeling that someone doesn't like me, something more along them lines. Normally I am in a bad headspace before hand for this to happen. 

I am jittery on the inside, but outside I kind of just 'power down'. I have had someone who has watched me do this tell me that it was like 'all the life drained out of me'. I am normally focusing a lot on internal stuff, that there just isn't any energy or brain power to kinda focus on my outside appearance.   
Me having this severe anxiety panic alone vs in front of people is very different. Most of the time it happens outside of my house, and if I can then I want to go to the bathroom or somewhere to be alone ASAP but sometimes I can't.   
My brain is hyperaware of everything going on around me. Thoughts are racing, mostly about other people and how they perceive me and that I'm being weird and they hate me and i'm never going to have friends and i am going to be alone and i hate feeling alone. It's like spiral of thoughts that is just really hard to escape. It's hard for me to breathe most of the time, if I'm alone I'll hyperventilate. Tears start to form behind my eyes and if I am in public then I fight really hard to not cry because that's something which I hate doing but if I am alone I start bawling.   
I shake really badly when alone, I'll pace up and down to try and work off some of the excess energy. 

All this time my brain is just repeating the same overriding thought over and over again ""I want to go home"", but in a lot of them situations I can't go home, or I don't want to leave because my brain has a thing where I think if I leave the situation then I've failed and I've let my anxiety get the better of me so then I try to go back for a little while unless it's really bad.   


Sorry if this is jumbled, but it's the best way I can describe it. It's like a live undercurrent of energy beneath my skin that is uncomfortable and keeps me alert. "
"I can’t remember which subreddit I saw it on, but someone described social anxiety like you having conspiracy theories about yourself and I thought that was pretty accurate."
"A lot of my anxiety stems from fearing the worst. Statistically you will walk past multiple murderers in your lifetime. I'm an intimidating person so I know I won't be bothered, but I also know how vicious and feral human nature can be behind closed doors and i just imagine how backstabbing or disgusting and vile other people can be and it just keeps me from talking to them. Even passing in the street, if someone so much as looks at me I will always glance over my shoulder and watch the shadows for them because I worry they might want to attack me or rob me. Most people won't fuck with a 6'3"", 320 pound man on the street, but the anxiety is always there. The only time my anxiety doesn't exist is when animals are involved"
It feels like I want alcohol to alleviate it.
Most social interactions feel like I’m trying to perform on stage but I don’t know my lines. 
"You need to use bathroom at work. Two stalls but someone is in one. No way you are able to go with someone listening.  You want to leave but then the person in the stall will know you dont want to use the bathroom with them there. Just wash hands instead? No, then they might come out during and you'll have to say hi and still not get to go. So you go in stall and hope they flush and leave. Then the weird bathroom stand off begins. What if they are waiting for you to leave? How long do you wait until you give up and pretend you silently went? Force it and risk a fart?  Resolve to start bringing water bottle with you so you can fake it next time. This is happens every day. "
"It's that nervous, flushed, heart-racing feeling you get when you've done something embarrassing, but you've actually done nothing wrong. "
Something you would like to have lobotomy done to you.
Right now I'm sitting with my dragon boat team at my first competition. Even though I know everybody I'm here with well enough I'm here alone. Some people I'd like to be friends with get up and go to get food or hang out somewhere without me. I'd like to just tag along but they just go without a second thought to me and I feel like I'd be an odd one out if I tried. 
"Every person I have ever spoken to is a conscious effort to think of something that sounds natural to say in response to whatever they said to me. If I do this all day long, by the end of the day I’m exhausted and I want some time alone to mentally rest."
"It’s a very complicated mess.

I don’t really have trouble at school, I’ll talk to people and have made a fair number of friends.

Now don’t get me wrong, I love my friends, but when they say hey wanna hang out it always makes me a little queasy. It ultimately clears up and we have a great time, but it scares me a little nonetheless. 

Parties are a big no no. I’ve never been to a party with friends but if they asked , and I know they wouldn’t, I would say no in an instant. It just wouldn’t end well. Family gatherings are also bleh. I’m surrounded by people I barley know and resort to hiding away in a bathroom or backroom, I hate the environment.

Going out into public places is a whole other story. I will only go out if I feel clean, I guess is how to explain it. I would never run errands if I haven’t taken a shower or aren’t properly dressed, though this might be a different issue. When my mom asks me a simple question like “hey wanna go to the super market with me?” I gotta think for a while. I immediately think “no way! What if I see someone I know?” , but I don’t want to let my mom down so I usually end up going. 

Don’t get me started on phone calls. I hate them with a burning passion. I will only, and I mean ONLY talk to my immediate family and maybe really close friends but it still frightens me. Texts are okay though. 

I also hate strangers who knock on the house door. No I will not let you in! And when my parents have guests over I hid in my room.

Though this is just the tip of the iceberg, as it’s hard to express your self with virtual text. It confuses me because while I hate most social interactions, I’m the team manager for 3 sports at my school, and it’s a lot of talking with strangers which you should know by now, I hate.

Thank you for reading :)"
Not remembering what you ordered in a fast food/restaurant (in person) because the stress of the situation caused you to black out that moment.
Being thrown into fight or flight bc you mispronounced a word and then you're struggling to get back into the flow of conversation which makes you panic more and more and now you're aware of your cheeks flushing and you don't know how to just stop so you wish someone will interrupt you or the ground will open up. And this all happens even though you know no one gives a fuck. 
"Social anxiety probably varies from severe to mild from person to person. For me it was mild and then severe to the point of going in to panic/dilerium. I think if you notice it getting worse, it could be an underlying neurological problem - at least that's what I discovered. "
It feel hard to get out and try to meet new people.
"I saw a post on r/socialanxiety that summed it up perfectly. It said talking to a new person is like taking a test that you didn't study for. I'm very socially anxious, but I've always been good at bullshitting my way through tests."
"Imagine you wake up and the prospect of going outside fills you with dread and pure panic, and once you actually go outside, your brain is telling you that you are super weird and strange, and makes you imagine that people are staring at you and judging you as if you painted yourself bright pink with a sign that said ""make fun of me I'm different""."
Bad
"Apparently you feel the need to stew about it, seek out others on the internet with the same problem, and subconsciously commit to never trying to actually do something about it.

I had it when I was younger. So glad Reddit wasn't around back then. Misery loves company and all that."
"I open my phone in parties and just pretend to be on the phone or texting, standing in a corner, usually for the entire duration. If I drink though, it's all good."
Awesome! Curl into a ball and cry struggling to breathe (not terribly untrue) 
"You know that feeling you get when you drink too much coffee? Your mind is racing, you can't concentrate on any one thing, and you feel a little jittery, unstable, and just generally uncomfortable?

If you imagine feeling like that in any social situation, you've got a pretty good approximation of the physical sensation."
It's awful. Don't buy it.
"Getting the wrong order and just accepting it and walking away because you don't want to have a prolonged conversation with the person.

Buying groceries with your wife on a Sunday, all is good. Suddenly you feel a little tired, like you ran down one of the aisles. The colors of the products on the shelf become brighter and more apparent. You notice the shape and pattern of everything around you. The mismatch of random noises around you goes from one mixed droning to a thousand individual sounds. The squeaky wheel on the cart, the old man coughing in the aisle across from you, crackle of the PA system is all clear, loud and separate. Your throat closes and your eyes tear up, you either hyper ventilate or you start breathing slowly to try and calm down. Couple people may be staring at you now, but that actually doesn't bother you as much as the assault on your senses and your body turning against itself.

If you're lucky you're able to get to the car before bursting out into guttural, instinctual sobs that you can't control.

When it passes you probably feel very tired, but strangely contented. Sometimes you fall asleep in the car right in the lot after that."
"It feels close to dying, in slow motion. 
A creeping, crushing blackness. 
Like squeezing yourself through a tunnel 2 inches too small. The air gets thick, your mouth is so dry it hurts, your heartbeat pounds in your ears, drowning out everything else. It feels like your chest is going to cave in, your ribs crushing the air out of your lungs. You gasp for every breath and feel like you get nothing. Your heart convulses so painfully it feels hollow, like you have no heart at all. The tunnel is collapsing, there's no way out. You begin to panic, everything blurs, coloured smudges are staring at you you, faces distorted and twisted into looks of disgust and disinterest. Your stomach twists up into the space your heart used to be. You're dying and no-one can help. You don't want them to help. You want them all to just disappear. 


Just my experience.
(Based on the worst social anxiety attack I've had) "
"When I see someone I know while walking that hasn't seen me I'll cross the road and pull out my phone to pretend I haven't seen them. Or I'll change my route so I don't accidentally bump into them.

I don't like seeing people with out an activity to do, because I don't think I'll be able to say anything and will bore the other person.

For the above reason I don't invite friends over, or ask to do things with them.

If I went to a regular meeting thing (like a club/society/class) and I missed a few sessions I'd feel that I couldn't go back. No idea why. I'm better about this now though.

At university/school I wouldn't ask teachers questions or answer open questions, because they might make me look stupid. This has basically translated to me being a lurker on reddit, and I had to make a conscious effort to scroll back up and answer this question.

Not wanting to be early for anything in case I have to talk to people, or just wait awkwardly around other people. I have walked randomly around department before meetings with professors (at university) because I was one or two minutes late. Also not wanting to be late, because that's just rude. This combination meant I knew exactly how long it took me (within 10 seconds) to get to specific rooms/places if I went there regularly.

If someone tells me something and I've done weeks of research and have a ten minute presentation and 3000 word essay on that subject on my laptop next to me that contradicts them I will still cave and agree that they may have a point. Because I might have missed something. And if one of us is wrong it's definitely me. Which is also why I'm hesitant typing this.

Before a social event to see friends I haven't seen in ages I always start convincing myself it's be better to cancel, because reasons.

Probably more things that I can't think of right now."
"Awful, I second guess everything I do every day, and everything I say, and I start to panic whenever I hold a long conversation with anyone, and start to wonder if they're just annoyed with me and wished I could just go away. I never fit in, because I don't let myself fit in, but is hard and exhausting to try to fit in."
Ive learned to control it by not socializing. Family or friend parties just point me to the cooler and ill sit myself in a corner and let my wife go and socialize. I think i was once social but it changed after high school.
"Some things as small as walking past people that are walking in your direction on the street makes you feel really tense and anxious, to put it simply. "
"When i go outside and join any kind of social group which are bot my best friends, i get cold sweat, shaky knees, trembling voice. Any kind of group qualifies for this, from the standing in line at the supermarket to being invited to a party. Good thing is, alcohol surpresses these symptoms. Bad thing is, alcohol supresses these symptoms. Its probably not as bad as it sounds like, because when being around people i know well its noot too bad (i am easily able to go to work without my anxiety-gin-tonic). "
"I have General Anxiety Disorder but also used to have a lot of Social Anxiety issues. I would be really happy to go to a party/bar/movie until I got there and then I would get this sense of dread like something really bad was going to happen. This uneasiness. Like when you meet someone who is off-putting except it is unwarranted and isn't one person. It's odd but I would feel 100% better walking home from wherever late at night alone where you could get mugged/robbed/etc (which I never really feel that but just saying) than just standing around friends and happy people. 

It is infuriating knowing you are fine but not being able to convince yourself. I've since gotten over a lot of it with some therapy and help with meds. Personally I try to not use meds but they helped initially and I recommend them if you feel like you need them. I just used them as a crutch I suppose instead of relying on them. If you need them don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 

I still deal with depression. I was doing a lot better with that as well but this last year my mother died and I'm not dealing well, so probably therapy/meds are in my future if this weird delayed response I'm having to it doesn't subside soon. The reason I mention the depression is because a lot of times anxiety goes hand in hand with depression so don't overlook that.  You get anxiety, start avoiding things you used to like, get depressed,  repeat for everything you liked. Be careful with that. I waited way too long trying to get help and I stubbornly thought I would overcome. Cost me many years. 

Depression is terrible but I really REALLY don't miss panic attacks and constantly feeling on edge. Whether which is causing the other probably depends but in my case getting rid of the anxiety helped greatly dealing with the depression."
"Fun.

Pre-medication. 

Have to make a call? Fuck you, you can't. 

Have to sit in a car for your driving practice? Absolutely fucking impossible. Hide in bushes for 2 hours and then run away. 

Need to enter that one room to talk to that one person? Nah. Once stood near some particular room for 6 hours, couldn't force myself to enter.

As a child to young teen I've had piano exams in front of people. That's just a horror movie right there. You're sitting in a comatose-like condition and absolutely nothing can make it better. 

First it's like a nagging feeling deep down in your stomach like something is boring down there and then it spreads through your whole body to your lungs and your heart. You're weak and stiff at the same moment. Nothing is worse. You're dying, the planet is dying around you. It's the end.

Fun.

Post-medication.

Better with all of the above. Can make calls, can enter rooms. Yey.

You're outside and there's a person 100 yards from you. This person is now the center of your world. You have to be something, have to behave somehow that tell that person - yes, you may be their equal. Several person? Have fun.

It's evening, you're out and there are people around. They are loud and they are having fun apparently (what the fuck is that can anybody tell? How does that feel?). There's like a forcefield around you that's going thinner by the minute. At some point it pops. Blood rushes to your face, pupils dilate, heart starts beating even faster than usual. You're closing on a panic attack. Retreat!

P.S. Kids don't do drugs, bring them to me^e^e^e^e^e"
"When my social anxiety was really bad, my speech became impaired. It was like I had a cotton ball in my mouth and I would say non-sensical or stupid things. I was in high school and I had no friends because of this. Whenever I’d try to talk to people I would sweat, freak out in my mind, and treat it like it was the most difficult feat of my life. Around that time my mental health started degrading, too, as a direct result of my anxiety. I started becoming delusional and I wouldn’t be able to form thoughts correctly. My writing started becoming more convoluted and strained. I started writing like a 7th grader who used big words he didn’t know (note that the previous year, I was top of my class). I would break down to my teachers who started giving me lower grades. My delusions began seeping their way into every aspect of my life and started becoming bigger and bigger. My perceptions became so skewed to the point that almost every thought I had was unconventional. I couldn’t feel anything but hopelessness. It was like my prefrontal cortex reward center shut down. That area of your brain is constantly producing even when you haven’t done anything to trigger it. Now imagine it not working at all. That’s how I felt. I stopped eating because that wasn’t enjoyable either and I had no desire to. I had no energy throughout the day and couldn’t focus on anything. The worst part about it was I couldn’t talk to anyone about it because I was still hopelessly socially anxious. So that’s what it’s like when it get really bad. "
"Similar to the feeling before an important interview, but all the time"
"It's a primal, instinctual urge to not interact with people. At least that's how it feels to me "
"I can tell you what it it like to be married to someone with Social Anxiety.


You have to go to weddings and funerals alone. Even if it is your beloved grandfather's service, you have to drive in your grief because your spouse is STERNLY set on going with you for support but can't face having to deal with funeral etiquette. I am so glad he tried, though.


You get to buy tickets to events you and your spouse enjoy and then end up going alone literally five minutes before the event happens and you never get a good parking space. I swear his social issues have improved mine. I can make friends in an empty room now and give speeches in front of strangers. 


You have to make up excuses for friends and family who happen to be in your neighborhood as to why they can't just come over. This is the worst, because IMMEDIATELY my friends think I hate them. No, I don't hate you, my husband simply can't have you over our house. 


Oh, and I'm also not allowed to TELL people my husband has social anxiety. I don't know how long this is going to last. I've done really well so far for ten years per his request but with close friends, I had to tell them to keep them and my sanity. 


You also have to explain to acquaintances that no, my husband really doesn't mind me going away for the weekend with my girlfriends or out to drinks/dinner. Most of the time, he pays the tab for the Lyft. He wants me to have fun and enjoy my life.


I look forward to reading the rest of this thread for insight on others."
The worst is actually saying something and then feeling like you said something stupid or off putting that makes you look like a freak and replaying that comment for all eternity.
"Uhhhm, extremely stressful. I've always wanted to dance at a wedding or something but all I've achieved is getting smashed at Mardi Gras and dancing. It always feels like people are judging you even though I know for the most part they don't give a fuck. It's just really stressful."
"It's having an in-built assumption that nobody really likes you that much, and constantly being on the lookout for evidence of if this is true or not.

I can have a conversation at work with someone that I don't know very well and think that it didn't flow well or seemed awkward and think about it for weeks. Everything is over-thought when you have social anxiety. Picture this-

You're in a morning meeting and there's a fruit basket, you grab an orange, your favourite fruit. As soon as you start to peel it you become very self-aware, why could you not have picked a simpler fruit? Are you peeling it weirdly? You don't want to draw attention by putting your peel on the desk so you pile it on your lap. You're not hungry anymore but you feel obligated to see this through in case someone thinks you feel awkward peeling the orange and your cover is blown. You haven't even listened to a word of the meeting. You need to go to the bin to throw your peel away but it's across the room and you're scared. Why are you scared? You're fully aware that nobody cares about this but you, but you're still scared. Another co-worker just went to the bin to throw away their peel, great! They've set the preceident that this is a normal movement to make but you need to wait just long enough that you're not copying them. You make your move and walk to the bin, you're very aware of your arms the whole way and if you look casual enough. You return to your seat and feel a sense of relief as if you've just finished a huge test. 

Now apply this sort of thinking to literally anything you do. 

I'm a huge extrovert and love being around people but I really struggly to psych myself up to go to events unless I know a lot of people or can be ensured by someone that they want me there. "
I have to cut through a university to get to work and I work in the afternoons so I walk through the campus at lunch time. Everytime I walk through it's like someone took the air out of my lungs and I can't breath. I see people looking at me and I get super self concious about living.
Liking the idea of playing PS4 online with a group of people and in turn being terrified of having to speak let alone perform well in a team event with people you don’t know. 
"Super late to this thread, but for me it manifests itself as a feeling of intense and irrational paranoia. Intellectually, I know nobody gives a shit about me or what I'm doing, but the *feeling* is that everyone is judging me. Every whisper is about me, every laugh is *at* me, every conversation is a condemnation of me. I turned to alcohol to self-medicate and lubricate the uneasiness in night out type situations, and needless to say, things just spiraled from there. I am now old enough and have been dealing with it long enough to be so tired and kind of beaten down by it that I'm more able to shrug it off as ""who gives a fuck,"" though that can be negative as sometimes it makes me have an unfavorable impression of others for no valid reason. I'll walk around saying ""fuck these people"" in my head, assuming they're making judgments of me, when in reality that can't possibly be the truth. Because of the intensity of the feeling, it's hard to intellectually tell myself to chill out. I've slowly been learning, over the course of nearly a decade, to deal with it more healthily. The weirdest part is that I didn't always have it. I was a fun-loving, goofy teen into my early twenties and I am pretty attractive and charismatic with friends and strangers one on one, so there was no real reason for it to have started. But I also suffer from some mental health issues that probably (see: definitely) go hand in hand with the anxiety."
"Like shit, I sometimes can't bring myself to take my children somewhere, because my anxiety will dissuade me from even wanting to go."
it s like being nervous to meet new people only not with new people but with everyone and it's not just at the beginning of the encounter but all the time you are around someone. its like you re an explorer in a strange land where you don't know the customs or language and are never sure if what you say or do will get you accepted into the tribe or expelled / speared as a threat.

"Heart racing, tightness in chest, and inability to think perfectly straight from nervousness...when just thinking about the idea of stepping slightly outside your social comfort zone. When actually in a social situation with people you're not familiar or comfortable with, your brain finding every excuse it can to refrain from speaking your mind or letting the ""real"" you out for fear of having the spotlight put on you and being seen as awkward.

Years of this, leading to conditioning yourself into believing you're just not a social person."
"You know that feeling you get with stage fright or before a job interview?

Imagine that, 24/7, every day."
"Interacting with people is very difficult. You constantly worry about what everyone is thinking about you and looking for any escape you can find. It's so irrational that most people without anxiety don't understand it. If you're scared of heights, just imagine that feeling from most social interactions.

Every once and awhile I find someone I'm completely comfortable with and won't have any anxiety around but if you ""mess up"" then you freak out for a minute until you realize it's them.

I got put on antidepressants a few months ago and it really helped me with it.

Oddly enough I'm terrified of people normally but if I'm on stage for drama or playing in my band I have no anxiety.

You don't want it. "
For me it's like I want to go do fun things and socialize but whenever I try to I end up making some minor mistake or saying the wrong thing and my mind won't let me forget about it. So I always end up just giving up.
Reading this makes me think I have very mild social anxiety. Does everyone have a bit of this?
"Before I go into public places like a grocery store, I have to have a pep talk. ""Remember, no one is looking at you."" Its something my Mom used to say dropping me off to school.

Sometimes I feel the anxiety to the point I won't visit a store if I need something. "
"For me it's like a fight-or-flight response that's always flight and always in situations that don't require such a reaction: buying groceries, phone calls, sitting in a meeting, hanging with friends, big family dinners, etc.

Usually I'll get a bit shaky, my heart races, sweaty palms, blushing (not in the cute, romantic way).  I'll trip over my words a lot and often have trouble saying what I want to say, or even properly thinking of what to say.  It's not logical, but I feel scared even though there isn't anything dangerous happening."
"An eternity of feeling that you are always, always, always being a pest, annoying people, getting pity invitations. That perhaps even the dog doesn't exactly prefer your company. Going overboard for friends because, well, you think they deserve it for tolerating you, which makes things more awkward. Wondering if, in a moment of not feeling soul-crushing anxiety if you in fact made a GIANT ass of yourself."
"Imagine your entire life is a game show, and the audience is laughing at and judging your every move. That's how I feel every time I go outside. "
"Terrible, it's different for everyone but I would get intense nausea and I feel like I was suffocating. That's just the tip of the iceberg but I won't go further all you need to know is that you feel like you are going to die"
"Think about the way you feel when a first date is going terribly, or how you feel when someone says they're ""fine"" but you can tell they're pissed, or how you feel immediately after a Freudian slip. 

Now imagine feeling like that during every social interaction. There's a lot more to it than that, but that's basically the gist of it."
Great until I have to leave the house and socialise with others 
"Reading through these comments is the first time I have seen a discription of exactly how I used to feel in day to day life.

I worked as a cashier in a busy shop for 4 years for the first 6 months all customers got was hello and the price of the bill, all without eye contact.😂 My heart would be pounding the whole time. The worst place for someone with SA to be working. 

I have mostly overcome it now I think dabbling with shrooms and mdma may have played apart with putting things into perspective.

 I now try and have a no fucks given attitude to my anxiety and hold my head high and make eye contact when speaking. Some people suffer may suffer worse than I did but hope some can overcome it as I have.

Please do not take this as advice "
"Super late to the party, but I wanted to share my thoughts.

It's like being on a roller coaster constantly: In some part of your mind you know you're safe but the rest of your body is screaming ""HOLY SHIT YOU'RE GONNA DIE!"""
You get nervous while shopping because the simple act of talking to the cashier is weighing on your mind.
"It just feels like your body isn't reacting to what it should be reacting to.

Social anxiety isn't always a character trait, albeit sometimes it isn't even a mental disorder. Anxiety can be caused by thyroid issues, addictions, loss of stress, mental conflicts, focus, beliefs, change, etc.

It can come and go... like confidence (and usually, it does for everybody). For instance, I had social anxiety in high school, and it disappeared for about 4 years, then came back again. It is usually accompanied by general anxiety.

Imagine walking into a room, the same room that you've walked into 4000000 times in your life... except this time, you stutter your words, you feel a bit weak and shaky, you start sweating, wondering if people notice, you overthink everything you say, you take frequent bathroom breaks.

It can range from mild to severe. Mild would be something along the lines of being a bit shy when you go to a new school or city... severe could be having frequent panic attacks, losing jobs, over using alcohol to cope, losing sleep, eating less, etc.



"
Lonely. But that loneliness is your comfort and your misery. 
"Imagine how your body would respond to you being in a room with a lion.

That’s how you feel being in a room with people. And no matter how irrational the feeling is, or the thoughts you are having are, getting them to stop is impossible. You’ll look for things that seem to verify your irrational thoughts, or even worse, some of them will be confirmed to not be irrational.

“My god they all think I’m so quiet and weird”

Coworker: do you ever talk? 

Initiate feeling like literal shit about yourself and thinking they all for sure think you’re a weird idiot. "
"Most societies require some form of interaction which makes things really hard for people like me who can get panic attacks in social settings. 

Shopping can be difficult, school, work, everything. Anything that involves people. For awhile i was afraid of getting stuck in traffic and afraid i would have a panic attack in traffic.

Social anxiety is just normal anxiety but its amplified in the presence of other people."
"When I'm in a social environment with no one close to talk to, I want to go home.

When I'm by myself, I get gripped by loneliness.

It's a frustrating contradiction. "
I think everybody doesn't want to hear what I have to say so I isolate myself before they can talk to me and it really lowers my esteem. I try to tell my dad about it but he tells me to suck it up and just do it but I can't because I'm already thinking about things that can go wrong
"You know how you feel when you remember something really embarrassing you did when you were a kid and it makes you cringe?

I remember every social interaction like this. "
"My friends text me to ask if I want to hang out - I get physically sick for a LONG time afterwords. I text the girl I like - I can't eat for almost a whole day afterwards. I developed my anxiety about a year and a half ago and have lost 45 pounds since then.

I love going out with my friends, but holy shit do I get sick for the hours before and for the first hour+ after we start hanging out."
It's like being in a trance 
Scared to go anywhere in case I end up being a burden.
"That for everyone it’s different. Mine may not be as bad as the next person or I may not struggle as badly as others. It’s still lingering. Small some days when I’m doing better and a large uncomfortable weight on my shoulders another day. 
I can’t say this is how it is for everyone but for me I find that if I am socializing more regularly with my job (especially in retail)  then I’ll find it easier to start conversations but that one slip up and look of either questioning or confusion or uncomfortableness sets me back further. Like I sustained an injury long ago and have been building up my strength in the muscles again just for another injury to happen again and set you back to zero where you start all over again. 
Being around people helps and also doesn’t help but I find if I go a long period of time without socializing with anyone relatively new then it sets me back even further in to the negatives. Like the thought at that point of simply walking out my front door in to the real world haunts me. The idea of grocery shopping makes me second guess myself. Being around all those people. As if they’ll watch or judge how I look, walk, what I buy. When I’m in those negatives it’s almost like I forget how to be natural with my body outside of my safe zone.where do my hands go? Do my arms swing like this or this? Those first steps in to the zone of uncomfortableness it’s like your body is mechanically operated where your brain has to specifically say, “Left foot, right foot, left foot, now grab the door handle...”

I don’t know how it is for everyone and I know mine isn’t as bad as others but it still messes with me and hinders my day to day life like anyone else and that’s okay. There are days where it’s not as bad and that makes me happy and I congratulate myself. I went shopping by myself. I handled this thing at work by myself without mentally breaking down. I was able to ask for help properly. We will all have our good and our bad days. It’s just about getting through them all the best we can even if it means asking for help. My boyfriend doesn’t have this problem and doesn’t really understand how I feel completely but he always tells me he’s there for me. That he’ll be there to help me when I need it. To help give a little push and sometimes we need that from friends and/or family. Someone to not criticize us but gently help us face the terrors of social anxiety. "
"You always just feel off....   like you're doing something wrong and everyone knows.
"
"Fear

You feel uneasy and nervous. You have a difficult time interacting with people your not 100% comfortable with. Making eye contact with someone is incredibly difficult. You may wonder if people are judging you aswell. 

It just sucks "
Imagine yourself drowning. You're unable to swim and you're constantly sucking water into your lungs and EVERYONE is judging you for dying... yet nobody is even noticing you and there's no water in sight.
"You feel as if the whole world (except your cat and your closest friends) is judging you, and rarely ever positively. This leads to serious self-loathing.

It’s nigh impossible to come across as confident to strangers. "
Like you hate yourself after every human interaction.
"You practice your order at starbucks in your head a million times and you still mess it up. Oh, and the barista is an actual friend. And you STILL mess it up.

And it feels like every social interaction requires a detailed plan with all the bases covered. It's like navigating a maze every time you're talking to a friend. 

It's putting off going to the doctor because you can't make a phone call.

It's getting frustrated and crying cause you can't even enjoy hanging out with friends because you're stressing too much about what you're gonna talk about.

It's struggling to maintain three friendships, let alone more.

It's not having any casual friends because you can't be casual.

It's having gone on two dates your WHOLE LIFE and they went terribly. "
Is there such thing as a Socially Anxious Extrovert?
God this is depressing. 
Like everything you want to do you can’t because your worried about what everyone else will think even though you truly don’t care what they think it still matters. *sigh*
"Like you've been cast as the lead of a show. A show that will decide the career and lives of everyone else in it. The show has been rehearsing for months, close to a year. Everyone, all your friends NEED everything to go perfect, or else it is a life of abject misery for them forever. They've had this planned since they were able to think.

But you have never read the script, and you only got cast 30 minutes ago."
"Social anxiety played a big roll in college for me. I was terrible at making friends and people never really approached me because my neutral face was a “bitch face”. When it came time to make groups for projects, I kind of waited around and got put with people who didn’t have enough members, because I was too afraid to put myself out there and ask to join a group. Many times I skipped out on my morning classes if I knew I’d be too late, just to avoid the awkward walking into a class and having everyone stare/judge you, even though I know truly, people don’t care. 

Now here I am as an adult. I feel like it’s still part of my life as I find it hard to add to a conversation at work, I just do more listening than anything. People think I’m shy but really I’m super outgoing, it just takes a lot for me to want to talk. I feel like because of social anxiety, I kind of keep to what I’m comfortable with and I don’t branch out. I’m too afraid to do interviews so I feel like I’ll be forever stuck at a workplace that I’ll never grow in. 

I hate it so much, I feel like it’s holding me back from a lot of things in life. A lot of my friends have come and gone, maybe because they feel I don’t want to keep the friendship since I’m not putting much effort into hanging out and what not. Well, that’s my life I guess."
"Overthinking. Overthonking about fucking everything. You overthink about what you're going to say, so you just stay quiet. And because you're staying quiet you start overthinking about the fact that you're staying quiet and you start stressing about that and yeah...it just keeps spiraling down from there. Fun stuff"
You're like a broken puppet whose eyes have fallen inside
It feels like regret.
Basically I want to do things and get excited about going out until I do. Once in our all I want to do is go back home. 
"Its like thinking that everyone is talking about you when you go out when no one is even paying attention to what you are doing. Asking for help at stores is really hard for me, which I know is stupid. Sometimes answering calls is hard for a lot of people with it as well. Small talk is the worst, never knowing how to start a conversation, constantly thinking people hate you or are judgine you. "
It feels like everything you say or do is being judged and that you are constantly in the spotlight even though it is not and you are not. You over think every little detail of a discussion with a person. Was I polite? Did I engage them? Do they even like me? Was I sitting or standing in a manner that they could perceive as standoffish? You end up thinking this even for people you know you will never see again. Most of the time you avoid talking and interacting with people altogether because of this. If you do end up interacting you immediately regret it.  
You know that feeling you get when you trip on something or slip on a patch of ice and while you're falling and you know you can't catch yourself and your heart rate jumps through the roof? It's like that once you open your mouth to say something. 
Wanting to fuck that cute girl in your class with all your fetishes like bondage etc but afraid to ask her
"Normal. But that's just because it's all we know.

In cases like mine the anxiety itself stops being a pressing issue because you just generally avoid social conditions. The problems come from disconnection and ""social procrastination,"" being out of touch and failing to do necessary things because it would force you to interact with someone.

You'll develop some contempt for people who go to great lengths and costs to go to music festivals and concerts, not out of jealousy, but because since you don't get enjoyment from social events and it seems like they're wasting a ton of time and resources to gain nothing but a fleeting psychological ""high"".

The tendency to avoid socializing will eventually become a viscous cycle, discomfort interacting with others leads to less interaction, leads to less socializing. This doesn't usually mean becoming a complete hermit since for a lot of us casual social contact is pretty easy in a formal settings: shopping, dining out etc, are pretty low stress, it's usually the ""socializing for its own sake"" that becomes awkward and anxiety inducing."
"I’ve had SA for 15 years. The best way I can describe it is feeling out of place no matter where you go. Not only out of place - incredibly out of place. Like wearing jeans and a T-shirt to a corporate interview out of place. You don’t belong and it’s obvious to everyone. It doesn’t matter what you do or say - you are not supposed to be there and they all know it. They’re all laughing at you and judging on the inside. 

I am never sure I actually have friends because my brain is always telling me that those people who care about me are disgusted with me and would rather never see me again. Even when there is a mountain of logical evidence to refute that way of thinking. 

"
Sometimes I feel like I’m in the White Bear Justice Park. Like everyone is onlookers.
it sucks for me. try to avoid all contact but i'm also extremely self conscious so I NEED to be with someone to feel right. talking is also very hard
"You know the feeling you get when you fucked up really badly and you're waiting for your parents to come home from work and punish you? It's that, all the time. Ringing in your ears like a mantra. It's like a constant minor headache in the back of your head whenever you're somewhere you don't want to be.  
  
It's the sinking feeling in your gut when you accidentally say something super offensive to someone accidentally(Like a ""your mom"" joke to someone who just lost their mother) or when you find out you've been calling someone the wrong name for several weeks and they finally correct you.  
  
It's that fight or flight feeling that you get when you know you've fucked up with someone way bigger than you. Like you spilled a beer on someone who is way stronger and is definitely going to beat your ass.  
  
It's the feeling of dread that hangs over you like a cloud constantly whenever there is someone near you that you don't intimately know.  
  
And it is constant. Whenever you are in a new situation, it feels like your heart is dripping out of your chest and your teeth are collapsing and your brain is screaming and all of your muscles are triggering and neck hurts and your eyes hurt and everything is confusing because every part of you is screaming ""RUN!"".  
  
**TL;DR: It fucking sucks.**"
"I cant be around people, if i am, i need to get away from them as soon as possible. I just feel like im not supposed to be there"
"Everything I try to do looks like a mistake to me. All the words I say to people I always manage to find something ‘cringey’ about it. I always believe that nobody around me genuinely enjoys me as a person. With certain people I think everything is my fault, even if it isn’t, making it easy for me to be manipulated. 

I want to be around people and have fun but as soon as I do it I feel tired, uneasy and just want to go home. 

I know I do these things. And after the moment I tell myself no more, but when it happens again I do the exact same thing. "
I never want to leave the house on weekends. Dealing with people during the work week is exhausting. 
"It feels like everyone is judging or staring or laughing at you like there’s something wrong....even though you know rationally, there’s nothing wrong with the way you look or talk or dress. The words never seem to come out right and everything feels nerve-wracking and I get so afraid of people thinking I’m an absolute nutcase. 

Social anxiety has stopped me from joining things I want to do, or doing things in a new place because I’m absolutely scared of looking like a fool. BUT pushing myself to figure it out in socially uncomfortable situations, no matter how painful, has really been the only solution in moving forward. "
"You try to convince yourself you are better off alone, that you dislike people and going outside. Because it's better than realising there is an illogical fear of being out in the open and having to interact with others. Even if that's just walking past someone in the street or paying for something in a shop. Because then you'd have to smile and be polite, respond to the small talk, answer or ask a question. Your mind goes blank, you do a very good impersonation of a fish and then manage to mumble out a few words. you start breathing hard, have to think about calming yourself down that you'll be okay. Your hands start to shake you look around for an escape, something to distract you to calm you, plan what you are going to say and do and how so you can be prepared. 
Don't get me started on visiting places or meetings or partys! Even a family event gets me running for the nearest empty room. 
Will i ever be able to be normal and be happy in a social environment? Not a chance. So maybe it is better to be alone, not going anywhere and staying away from social interaction "
"Anything that involves talking to strangers (cashiers, doctor, etc.) makes me insanely sweaty to the point where I need to change my shirt the moment I get home. "
"I can’t go to stores alone except the grocery store (because I have to). I’ve recently started doing grocery delivery and even answering the door is scary sometimes. I order a lot of stuff online because I feel like I’m constantly being judged. That shirt, that book, those shoes... 

I can’t really eat in public unless I’m with 2-3 friends. I feel self conscious constantly. I listen to my music in the car on low because I feel people are judging me for my music taste.

Sometimes I choke up and freeze like a deer in headlights. If I’m in a crowded area I have a panic attack and flee. I can’t go to concerts or amusement parks because I freak out.

I don’t usually return phone calls cuz I can’t talk on the phone. I text primarily.

I hate it. Therapy helps a little, drugs more so, but still. Functioning in public is hard."
"I'm actually pretty good at talking to people, it's just that I take any amount of awkwardness as a sign that they hate me.

I'm also worried about screaming racist words in the faces of any people of a different race. It's never happened, but that doesn't stop me from worrying."
"It's incredibly hard for me to describe in detail, but think of it this way: Imagine that you're the new kid in school, everyone has their own friend groups, and all you want is to find someone to be your friend. The only problem is you have no idea what any of them are interested in because each group seems to speak a different alien language. After listening to these languages for a while, you pick up a few words here and there, but are too afraid to say anything to them simply because you've had bad experiences in the past and don't want to go through that again."
"To me, it’s like I can never genuinely feel comfortable around other people or trust them because I always, 100% of the time am questioning what they think about me or if they respect or like me. I’m always extremely nice to people and they think I’m just this really genuinely kind person, when it’s actually just this huge fear of having an awkward encounter or somehow offending someone. "
"As soon as I have some sort of invite I am looking for an exit plan or excuse. No matter how much I want to do something I am looking for a way out of it. That fear only increases as the event gets closer. It doesn't even go away when I am there. I could be there enjoying myself and I will have a voice in my head telling me to get out of there. Thats after the ordeal of actually making it into a place. Usually that requires twenty to thirty minutes sitting in my car or walking nearby as I psych myself up. This is giving myself countdowns from ten over and over, as I ignore the result. 

It feels like I am a gazelle walking into a loud room full of lions. As soon of I have engaged in a conversation thats another fucking bear trap I am going to have to chew myself out of. Its a deeply frustrating fear that makes me physically sick for days before anything and makes me want  to never the leave the sanctuary of my sofa, and enough of that goes by and people stop bothering to ask you, the perfect conclusion of self loathing, that makes even worse in any future interactions. "
"Having romantic feelings for someone, but thinking that there is literally no chance that they return your feelings so you never tell them because you think it would be a waste of time and want to hold onto the slim piece of false hope you do have. Also knowing that if somehow someone did ask you out you'd panic and fuck up making them think you don't like them even if you actually do. This includes the possibility of panicking and rejecting them but not realizing it until its too late so you never say anything and lose your chance."
"It’s like being a literal elephant in the room.  Anytime I go somewhere I feel like all eyes are on me, they are talking about me.  Makes you feel like your drowning and people are just staring at you laughing. "
"Blurting out awkward as shit stuff because you’re so nervous, and then replaying that moment for days and weeks in your head afterwards. "
"I relate to all this stuff, I've been feeling it at my job. But after a year of working on myself and much trial and error, I'm overcoming it. Can SA be overcome??

My brain used to tell me my co-workers went to smoke to get away from me. Now I think they just go to smoke. Sometimes I worry they talk about me. But I'm learning to accept that everyone gets talked about, good and bad things. I still worry sometimes though. I used to find myself leaving interactions wondering if I did or said anything that could be talked about, and replaying the conversation over and over in my head. I still do sometimes"
"I was the SAME exact way. Here's a trick that tricks your brain that works everytime I do it:

Super man pose. 

Like, go somewhere private when your at a party or somewhere social, like in the bathroom.

You can look in the mirror if you want. I do. 

Then stand like super man for a couple minutes. Chin up, open palm hands on hips(not fists), shoulders broad and straight, legs apart chest out. Like this: 

https://imgur.com/a/uM3n2du

This is a power pose. It tricks your brain into thinking you're feeling confident. Then you start to actuly FEEL confident . It might feel a little weird at first, it's just your brain switching gears.

When you sit and stand with your body closed off, (shoulders slumped, arms crossed, head down, avoiding eye contact etc) its because your brain is telling your body to do that because you feel uncomfortable. Not because you are cognititively choosing to stand that way, your body just responds to your brain signals :

Even if you ARE feeling confident for a moment, if you position your body in a closed off manner, then your brain responds accordingly, and you go from feeling confident to being self conscious or anxious. Like this :

https://imgur.com/a/cmH4OYl

Also, to REALLY get a boost, before you even leave the house to go somewhere social, do super man pose, or walk around the house like you are King shit, but ALSO listen to songs that are upbeat and fun and positive. 

The song ""Happy"" by C- Lo is PERFECT because you are actually saying ""I'm happy"" . And it is upbeat and makes you want to dance. It reprgrams your brain. 

Other great songs:
Im too sexy for my shirt
Venus by bananarama
Roar by katy Perry
Eye of the Tiger

Google search ""upbeat songs that boost confidence "" to find more.



Then, when you're at the party, avoid any kind of closed off postures. But also don't do the superman pose while talking to other people.(it makes you look domineering and arrogant) 

Do it in a more relaxed, confident but casual way instead.You can also do One hand on hip or in pocket with one hand holding drink in other. Keep your head level . Make eye contact and genuinely smile. Focus on what they are saying. Like these people:
https://imgur.com/a/f48YODS

You can ALWAY refuel in the bathroom with the superman pose. And look at your self smiling! You look great!

You will notice that not only are people going to want to talk to you and engage you in conversation, it will be easier for you to interact as well. But don't force your self to talk. Let it happen naturally.  If you feel the urge to say something,  just say it!

I PROMISE if you act confident and relaxed, you will FEEL confident and relaxed. Basically fake it till you make it.



Just TRY it."
"Humans need connection regardless of anything else. Social anxiety can be heinously cruel and isolating.

You want friends, to hang out and be liked. But there's the overwhelming feeling that people don't like you, hate you, think you are boring, or think you are stupid. You can't shake this feeling. It feels like judgment is around every corner. Causes you to be quiet or awkward. 

If anything awkward or embarrassing does happen, you replay it 100,00 in your head. "
shit i think i have social anxiety
It fucking sucks
"I threw up today in the middle of a train station because I couldn't handle the mixed smells and the huge crowd of people being loud. It's very overwhelming and then it leaves you exhausted. 

It's kinda like being tense all the time and only truly relaxing when you're at home or alone. It's stressing, it's frustrating, and it eventually makes you feel worthless because you can't handle things normal people can. Sometimes you develop depression over it.

So there's that."
"Spending too much time with friends starts with a dull headache, then the inside of your head starts to itch, then everything becomes harder and harder to deal with until you shut down. 

Being alone for the first thirty minutes after too long in the public eye you feel like being batman climbing out of the pit. "
"Feeling like everything you do is being picked apart by those around you. Your mind races a million miles a second and you overthink things and can't help it. You end up apologizing for things that are out of your control, yet still feel obligated to apologize. "
"Ever had sleep paralysis? Where all this stuff is going on around you but you can't move?

Imagine being at a bar or a party and you hear someone talking about something you really like, or a girl that compliments you, and all you can do is stand completely still and not move even tho you know you'd love to hop in the conversation and you know the people talking would enjoy having someone else to shoot shit with.

That's what it's like for me. I have to have a few drinks before I'll even try to talk to someone. It's started to become a problem because I love to be social but I have to be drunk before I have the courage to do it. "
"It's like my chest is closing in on me and it's super hard to breath. Sometimes it just happens when I'm around a lot of people but other times it's just the knowledge that someone I know (or I'm attracted to) is going to a party I'm at, but they don't turn up at the same time so I have to wait paranoid that they aren't going to turn up"
"I often find it impossible to start talking to people unless there is a group activity bringing us together.
I find it very tiring to be around groups of people for a long period of time/tend to be quiet in groups. 
And, when I need to do something (i.e. post a parcel, make an important phone call), sometimes my body essentially goes 'nope' and I start to obsessing over every possible negative outcome."
"To me, it was when you basically evaluate every decision to the point of indecision. Paralysis by analysis, but in social settings. Spending so much time wondering if what you are doing is ""right"" or ""acceptable"", and never trying to draw attention to yourself by doing something ""wrong"" or ""unacceptable"". You are thinking so hard that you get a warm fuzzy feeling, but in a bad way."
"I like to explain it like this (btw on mobile so spelling is gonna be trash)
Imagine you have someone who’s afraid of cats and goes nuts whenever he sees one and you have the other person who is cool with cats 
One day they both get scratched dude #1 goes batshit insane and the other person just avoids cats for a while"
Lonely
Like a hand that pulls you back all the time. 
"Jeez, I thought I had social anxiety due to being  awkward and stuttering occasionally when I get nervous talking to people but that doesn't compare to some of the people here "
"Let me provide a story.

First time I ever went to an anime convention. A week before, the friend I was supposed to go with had to bail because of family related things so I thought I'd go alone thinking what's the worst that could happen, I've always wanted to go and it'll be filled with people who like anime as much as I do.  I was good for a little bit, then I realized I knew no one, panicked and hid and was too afraid to leave the closed off corridor I hid myself in. Even though I knew everyone would be super friendly I was just too scared to leave. Ended up staying there for an hour till the particular even happening there ended."
Sweaty
"Imagine you're at a party. You don't know anyone. But everything looks scary, you feel awkward and shy and embarrassed and when you talk you can't quite form the words. It makes you physically uncomfortable. But you keep asking yourself why you can't do something as simple as socialising and you start to become a recluse, wishing how it would end and how you can hide because everything becomes 10x scarier. It's a feeling you don't want to feel. 

I used to avoid social events when I was younger, I always felt out of place. I couldn't even hold a normal conversation without panicking, sweating or going red. Most of the time I would stay inside my room and not talk to anyone.
"
Meh I feel broken. I feel I can't do what others can easily do. An overwhelming fear.
"There's kind of a weird narcissism to it, but only in the most negative way possible.

You don't consciously think it, but part of you is *certain* that everyone in the world knows exactly who you are, and they know because of that one kind-of stupid thing you did years ago. It doesn't matter how localized or inconsequential the thing was, in your head it's been magnified 1000x into the dumbest, most loathesome action on earth.

So yeah, it's walking into every room and being certain everybody knows you by your worst possible deed."
"I beat my anxiety a few years ago and then I moved to a new job, didn't make any friends, became incredibleylonely, then my social anxiety came back because I was so worried about making a fool of myself and then losing my chance of making friends therefore staying as lonely as I am. "
"Starting a new job is terrifying. 12 months on and I'm still thinking about that stupid joke I made in my first week which got a weird reaction, thinking they are still judging me because of it. In truth they have probably all completely forgotten about it, but I haven't and its scary.
It's really not a nice feeling.
Also, any uncomfortable silence, you want to say something, but over think it. Then when a conversation naturally starts up, you over think replies to everything.
In group conversations, I never really include myself, because by the time I've worked out the right way to put my bit in without being too pushy or not making sense, it's gone past the point where it would be a useful input.

Suddenly realising my mild social anxiety might be slightly less mild than I thought... "
Shit. 
It’s like when you are getting your picture taken and don’t know what to do with your hands...that feeling constantly.
"It makes me want to kill myself. No seriously, it’s ruining my life. "
Awful 
"Imagine you saw a flyer for a frat party and, with nothing to do and no one to hang out with, you decide to go. You get inside and realize it's a black fraternity, and you're the whitest of whitebread human beings. You don't know anyone there. No one is talking to you. You don't recognize any of the music. You stick out like a sore thumb, and feel that people are noticing. It's a house party, open to all, you've done nothing wrong and no one's asking you to leave....but you can't help feeling you've stepped out of line. Like you shouldn't be there.  


Now imagine that feeling is you base state. Out with friends, grocery shopping, walking through the park, extended family get together, doesn't matter where you are or what you're doing - if you ain't at home, in your sanctum sanctorum, you feel like you're crashing the party and people have noticed.  


The fact that I *didn't* feel that way - at least not beyond a manageable degree - at the wedding I just attended is evidence to me that the Prozac is working fucking wonders. Hope I feel as good about the reception, leaving for that now."
"Please bear with me, my English is fairly awful.

Imagine you have a rubber swim tube around you. Everyone does, it's the swim tube that carries you from day to day. Keeps you safe.

On most people, it fits really well, does a good job. Once they need to get out, it'll give them a little squeeze and remind them its time to go home.

But some people, their swim tubes don't work so well. They want to go out and mix with other people, but the swim tube seems to pick up on that as a potential danger, giving them a little squeeze to warn them. But they ignore it. After all, it's only a small feeling and they really want to see their friends, get some fresh air, have fun! 

So they go, and that tube doesn't understand why they stay so long in what it thinks is a dangerous situation, so it squeezes again - a little harder this time - to try and get them to go to safety.

But they ignore it.

This time the tubes had enough. Their person NEEDS to be safe, but won't go! Do they not understand? Is the tube not doing its job right?

So it squeezes again. Harder and harder until the person can't breathe. Everything starts to float and they feel dizzy. It seems like everyone is staring at them. Wondering why their struggling, being so silly in such a normal moment.
Will they laugh ? Point at you ? 

Why won't they stop staring?

The tube gets tighter and tighter, claustrophobic doesn't even begin to describe it. You know you need to get out, be alone in peace so the tube can relax. Something's wrong, the swim tubes telling you so but you can't see it. And that makes it so much worse.

But everyone else is ok. It's just you. Look at you. The weirdo, the strange person, the one who doesn't fit in.

You need to leave. Now. Quickly before you can't breathe anymore.

So you leave.

You go home, back to your room.

The tube relaxes, you can breathe. Everything stops spinning. You're safe."
"In addition to the fear, the tiredness. It’s draining to over analyze so many interactions through out the day and night. It can be simple to self medicate, but after being antisocial for awhile, things are even worse than when I was actually trying. Most people wouldn’t guess that I deal with it. For short interactions, or ones where im only gonna have to spend time with people for a night or a few hours, I think that I just come off as a nice gentle guy. It’s when people really get to know me that is horrifying. Knowing that it’s only a matter of time before they see how I really am and how I can’t grow relationships past the introductory stage of being polite. It’s like that comfortability that comes with time doesn’t exist because I can’t let my guard down. Still gonna keep working on it though! "
"For me it's leaving after a meeting, when usually everybody else will stick around to shoot the shit. I feel like I just don't belong in that room after business is done. Everybody likes me and I should know better but I basically walk out the second business has concluded. And then I worry if people noticed and think I'm weird. Nobody gives a shit though.

It's planning to have a video chat with my Dad and little sister but getting really overwhlemed with the fact that set a perfectly reasonable time.

It's walking by a group of acquaintances who are all sitting and talking. Instead of joining and interacting I say my hello and peace the fuck out. I have nothing better to do whatsoever.

Typing it out is weird because really none of this is that big of a deal but at the end of the day it means I'm always alone and not making connections that are waiting to happen. Like I'm thankful it's such a small thing but IS it such a small thing?"
"Me: I’m chilling, playing rainbow six

Father: Hey, we’re going to do (sample text) today at 5. Be there 

Me: Whatamigoingtowear?whatifitripinthemiddleofeveryone?whatifpeoplegivemelooks?illjustwearahoodandsunglassestoavoideyecontact.

It’s just a constant game of “what if...” 

Imagine you like this girl. You can’t ever bring yourself to talk to her because you think that what you’ll say will make you seem like a creep. Or what you say will make them just run. But then 1 year later you FINALY talk to her. She asked for your number. Your adrenaline SPIKES. you try to give her your number. But you keep shuddering. Stuttering.  You keep getting numbers mixed up. So you just write it down. “OHBUTWHATIFSHECANTREADTHEHANDWRITING” after you’ve left. It just sucks. She texts you. You never respond because you feel like you’ll fuck something up. 

For me it boils down to self esteem. But that’s just examples. "
"Like you just want to leave, go home, get comfy. You have no business being here. Inner dialogue is just a torrent of self abuse which turns into the relief of enduring embarrassment when you finally get to leave. It’s exhausting. Being at home alone or with a trusted love one is better. "
I'm not sure if I have it or I just hate people.. and I know I hate people.
"Im 31, 6'4"", 230lbs, and I make my wife talk to strangers for me. Once I meet people im usually not too bad off but I'm still not myself. I can't ever have fun at a party full of someone elses friends. "
"When you don't think about it, it doesn't feel like anything, it just feels normal.  It's when others bring it up or you are confronted with a situation that it really kicks in.

I felt pressured to go to an Xmas party for work.  I had avoided almost every Xmas before that except for a short one where i was actually working at the time and just stayed around for a bit, then left.

The one Xmas party was harsh and I hope I never have to go to one again.  I make up any reason to not go, the stress is really just too much.  I was part of the IT department and everything got political real quick.  All the clicks grouped together, I ate and chatted and had to leave.

After a while you stop caring what others think and you just don't go.  Some people don't understand because they value social interaction quite a bit.

The pain is really in the gut, it becomes self serving or slippery slope in that even within a group of say 50 or 100, you have sub groups and you don't want to interact with any group more than a few.  So you kinda ""buy time"" then leave.  The slippery slope part kicks in once it starts to hit, it makes things worse.  It's really hard to understand if you don't have it.  If you have a fear of heights, it's like being stuck on a high place.

This happened at 2 weddings that I went to.  I ended up leaving as soon as I could and only making small talk with a few people."
"Let's play a little game. Here are some rules and tips. They vary from person to person, and some have tons of asterisks, so I keep it as simple as I can.

- Every time you want to do something involving other people, spend as much time as you can thinking of reasons why it will fail. Ignore reasons why it will succeed.

- Every time you see an unknown person, hype yourself into a fright or flight response. Easy mode when it's only an attractive person, hard mode when it's literally everyone.

- Do not trust anyone.

- Every advice given to you that these rules are unfounded must be discarded immediately.

- Bonus points for reminding yourself that the rules are useless. You are still bound by them.

- Be as shy as possible. Corollary: Not every person with SAD is introverted, and shyness is usually associated with introversion, but it's just a game and we try to emulate something here.

- Do not have regular contact to other people. The fewer times you meet with people, and the fewer words you speak on average per day, the better. My highscore is 0 meet ups in 8 years and less than 50 words. You do not get an achievement for beating that score.

- Have depression. A pamphlet on how to emulate depression will be provided to you if needed. Sidenote: Depression and SAD are AFAIK not forcibly linked together, but every person I've heard their story of who had SAD also suffered from depression.

- Have a good memory. The better your memory is, the more past failures can be used to justify not doing something.

- Lastly, over time your social circle will get smaller. That is normal and should not be counteracted.

In case you wondered, I've been slumping around with these issues forat least 8 years, with some core problems going as far back as I can remember, which is about 20 years. The problems can gridlock, and they did for me, and I am honestly beyond the point of even trying anymore. I don't have the energy left, have no one willing to help me, and even if I did, I can't cope with failures. What I need is denied for me because of my problems, and no one is stupid enough to make the jump to work through my problems with me to maybe find a non horrible person at the end. It's not worth it. I am not worth it. And that's not just me saying this, people told me that to my face. More than one and more than once."
"Honestly the worst part is silence.

If you make a joke while texting and they won't respond, you instantly think that you messed up, and they'll probably come back with a cold response or massive rant.

If you attempt to lightly flirt, and they don't text back for a while, then you're instantly thinking that you're being creepy, and they'll come back with a cold response or a massive rant.

And real life conversations are much more daunting when a joke doesn't hit or they give a small response to something you said, almost as if they're trying to figure out how to get away from you."
Eye contact is one of the hardest things ever.  It’s like someone is trying to look at your soul.
"So you walked up to a cashier, right?      
At first, you feel fine.    
Then they speak to you.     
Now you have a weight on your chest, it's fine, you can manage that.    
The weight just keeps getting heavier, oh no!      
Now you're shaking a little bit.    
You notice this, and now the weight gets heavier as the shaking causes you more anxiety.     
Now you're stumbling over your words, or stuttering.    
This makes previous symptoms more intense.       "
"The knowledge of having to wait to visit with people feels like having to study before a really big test and then the actual visit feels like the really big test that you can't afford to fail.

You just want nothing to do with it."
"I have a friend I’ve know for more than a decade. He always shows up when I want to do something. He was the best man at my wedding and I’d count him as one of my closest buddies. 

Every time I see him I’m convinced he’s only showing up because of some twisted feeling of obligation and that he actually thinks everything I say is stupid. I feel the same way about a lot of people and I struggle to approach anyone new. 


"
Every time you feel like you want to make friends there's a nagging voice saying that you're better off alone and that friendships take too much work. This results in a lot of loneliness.
"Part of it for me is being hyper-aware and constantly overthinking things.

I analyze every little interaction, both as it's happening and then long after it's over. It's the mental equivalent of picking a scab or poking a bruise."
Painful.
"I'm constantly scanning people's faces when I can actually get myself to talk to them. If I get a reaction I wasnt exspecting (even just a micro expression of confussion or something) I start to panic silently in my head that they dont like talking to me. I'm leave people alone a lot when they talk to eachother because I don't want to intrude on their conversation. 
I constantly stay inside 90% of my free time because I don't have friends to hang with and also dont want to bother people by trying to hang out with them.
I feel like everyone hates me or is just puting up with me out of pitty. I over analyzed every conversation I have. 

I love being out and hanging out with people, but I have a helluva time doing that because my brain is always telling me no one likes me and what I'm saying is stupid and I'm acting like an idiot...  The last time I hung out with people I kept myself at a bit of a distance trying to not be needy of attention. And it seemed like they wanted to talk about personal stuff so I tried to keep my nose out of it.. But I'm also afraid that now they think I didnt want to be there and I didnt like hanging out with them... And its a whole mess in my brain trying to balance the thoughts that they hate me when i talk or that they think i hate them because i dont...

Its freaking exhausting -.-"
"You know that feeling when you're driving and almost rear end someone? Like a hot sweat with a chill? Like that, but all the time. At least for me that's what it's like."
"Imagine walking outside in the morning, but now you're in a foreign country where no one looks like you, no one speaks your language, and you're in a place where everyday people are somewhat prejudiced against your home, and you're naked without any access to clothes.

You're locked out of your home where it's familiar and comfortable, and you have to be across town in less time than you have to get there. You can't speak up and ask for help because no one will understand you. You'd try to explain why you're offending their sensibilities by being [insert unliked ethnicity] and nude, but you'd just seem as crazy as you look, worsening your situation.

So you steel up, gather your wits, and walk into the world hoping that no one will notice, and you'll get to your destination on time. All the while, you're bracing for the moment everyone DOES notice you, and they proceed to abuse and humiliate you before the police arrive and do the same."
"Whenever I get anxiety it feels like my fight or flight instincts are going off full blast. Similar to how someone without anxiety would feel in a situation where they know there is danger only I know there is no danger but my heart is still going 100 miles per hour and I’m hyperaware of everything I’m doing and mistake I’m making. I’ve been managing my anxiety well enough the past year where I can actually socialize and work now, but every day I know I have to go out I still get anxiety for the entire time leading up to the event."
"For me it's horrible. 

I worry knowing I have to leave my house to go to the shops, just to but something simple. 
The feeling of someone standing behind me in a line feels me with dread.
I can no longer look people in the eyes for longer than a few seconds. When I used to be full of confidence and didn't mind. 
I find it extremely hard to go to a restaurant. Again, being around people I don't know makes it hard for me to eat. I feel uneasy, I get sweaty palms and it feels like my throat has constricted every time I put food into my mouth. 

Those are just a few of the ""symptoms"" for me. It's horrible and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. "
"Was about to share SA moments... countless type/edit/delete.. select all, delete. end up sharing just this."
"It hard to talk to people I can't just go up to someone I just meet even if it's been a week and start a conversation. I always feel like I am annoying them or am rambling about stuff. I don't feel comfortable in most social situation or go to store I never been to alone.

"
The hardest part I have is explaining to my friends why I don't really feel like going out all the time. But I end up feeling guilty because they don't understand it and think I'm avoiding them mean while I'm just trying to stay in my comfort zone... vicious circle.
"When it’s happened to me it has felt so uncomfortable. So physiologically uncomfortable. Before I have even gone out. It feels like fearfulness. Like pressure to perform or that everyone will be looking at me. When I use to have a known place to go to, like a friend’s place or friendly bar I would go there and go out. If someone was asking me to go out and meet them somewhere new I could feel it kick in. Though I defied that once and came away meeting someone knew and it turned into a relationship. One that I broke off after almost a year and have struggled with letting go of the memories since then. I’m pretty sure I’m just “one the guys” she’s dated now. Sometimes you really have to defy that anxiety and push through. "
"Think about the last time you realised your phone wasn't in your pocket and you panicked trying to remember where you left it   
   
Imagine that feeling all the time"
"You have a hard time smiling on command.

You're perfectly capable of doing it when you see someone or something you like. You have no problem laughing at things you find funny. Smiling is easy as long as it's a reaction.

But try to pose for a picture. Try to perform this action that should be simple but this time you aren't distracted by how happy you are. 

...

Is this what I look like when I laugh? How are my friends smiling, maybe I should copy that? Oh no, it doesn't feel right at all. Should my mouth be this wide open? I really hope they don't focus too much on the gap in my teeth. 

My teeth are so crooked. Why didn't I get braces all those years ago? Does my breath stink? It does doesn't it? I know I shouldn't have eaten that greasy food for breakfast. I don't smell like grease do I? Oh no, I smell it. I smell the grease and everyone else probably does, too.

They must all think that I'm gross or don't bother to wash up in the morning.

I need to go to the bathroom."
Bad
"I have very mild social anxiety, and one thing that always cures it instantly is compliments (as a guy at least). 

""Those jeans look good on you""

""Have you been working out?""

Etc.

So if you think your friend might have some anxiety, drop them a ""hey, I really like hanging out with you."" It will relieve a lot of stress and make them more fun to be around."
"i equate it with being stuck in a seperate dimension. like im in my own area, but can't interact with the others"
"Troubling. I always am uncomfortable, no matter the situation "
Like walking into a cage of lions. 
"You'd rather walk a kilometer instead of taking the 200 meters shortcut because you don't want to deal with people hanging out on the way. It's ridiculous, you decided to do it because of a split-second instant of panic, but if you turn back *they will know*, and if you don't panic and just go, you spend the rest of the time thinking ""I'm getting closer to them, I need to get past them without bothering them and without looking at them and by walking at a perfect inoffensive pace, I should go back"" on and on and on and your legs feel heavier but you just walk and then you feel drained but you keep that pace for the rest of the way in case they look back and see you changing the way you walked.

I sucks being literally unable to talk to people.
"being tense 24/7 even when youre fully alone. Being afraid of even imaginary people judging you, not just real ones."
"It feels like I am always an unwelcome outsider.

"It’s having friends in from out of town for two days and being so upset that you screwed up somehow (even though you know you didn’t) that you’re in a deep depression for the next week. 

It’s being late coming back from lunch because the electronic ordering pad at Wawa is down so you have to drive to another one, lest the guy taking your order in person think it’s stupid (even though it’s a nothing special roast beef sandwich).

It’s being so ashamed of any criticism that it’s easier to just stop doing whatever you were doing. Even though the person is really just trying to help. 

It’s seeing that your kids don’t have as many friendships as the other kids with normal parents because everything is so play-date-based these days and you really just want to die because it’s one thing to suffer by yourself but it’s another thing to make your kids suffer. 

It’s knowing that the shithead who made fun of you won because she hurt you so bad that you can’t trust anyone ever because surely everyone must be laughing behind your back about your deformity too. 

It’s feeling like you wish your husband would leave you because he really really loves you for the way you are and you feel like you don’t deserve it at all. You reject love because you feel you’re not worthy. 

It’s being so goddamned lonely you wish you’d just die. But then your funeral procession would only have a few cars in it and that would be the final Memorial of your embarrassment of a life. "
"I have lied about having a ""family event"" to not hangout or go to a party more this year then I have had a real family event in the last 3 years."
"(A bit late but here goes)

It's an overwhelming dread at the thought of meeting with a group of people. There's a racing at the mere listen of a phone ringtone. Hiding under the bedsheets to avoid whoever is knocking on the door. You struggle  to make friends at work/university as the struggle to make conversation without fear of being judged consumes you. Even those close to you are only pretending to be friends with us because they pity us, at least that's what our brains tell us anyways. 

It's the rewriting of this comment over and over to make sure that what you're saying is worth something, hoping it doesn't fade into the background like you always do. Constant questions inside your own head, telling you not to eat in front of others or to drink a certain way so they don't have the opportunity to judge you. 

Hiding a smile because someone said three years ago that your smile is weird. Not being to go out as your hair isn't perfect and everyone else will know it. The slipping grades because you couldn't speak a word in the presentation which makes up half of your grade. Recounting the school assembly were you stood in front of everyone, their eyes all fixated on you even though you hadn't said a word. 

People who say sufferers of social anxiety are faking it, without knowing what a second feels like in our own bodies. We just want to be a functioning member of society and we can't even get that right. We're not trying to be ""trendy"" by faking mental illnesses, we're eating ourselves alive reminiscing over a conversation from months ago. 

I wouldn't wish social anxiety on anyone, and for those who don't suffer, help us if you can. Involve us as best you can. Keep trying to make plans with us even if we might not be able to show all the time. We might not say it, but those small things help us get through it all."
For me it kinda feels like a little person is freaking out inside my head whenever I have to socialize 
My chest feels heavy...hard to breathe.
"Like literally ever person you know is judging you over the tiniest shit. Like people say they love you or like you but give it a little bit and you need that validation again or you almost have a panic attack, sometimes you actually do have one. And new people are the most intimidating thing ever."
"You're always at a job interview, and your interviewer is that one kid from school who you never got along with and you really need this job."
bad
I went to the grocery store today and didn't buy my favorite alfredo sauce because there was a person in the isle and I didn't want to say excuse me.
"Whenever youre around other people having a good time, you want to join on them, but you cant because if you do, youll either be ignored or make things awkward and eventually they will phase you out and youll be by yourself again just browsing the internet just wondering why you cant have normal social interactions like everyone else you try to hang out with."
Idk i dont wanna talk to you
"It’s a range of things that go through my mind. Sometimes your afraid to say greetings like Hello, Good Morning to people. Sometimes you wonder if your friends and family really like your company. Are they just tolerating your presence? 

In your head you thinking about different things to say in scenarios to avoid being hated or even in conflict. After interacting with people you replay what happened and then your mind picks at things that you’ve said and makes it a bigger deal than it actually was. I often have to ask for advice from other people to figure out what to say to someone 

When I do speak to someone, usually ordering food and on the phone with customer service my heart raced and I get a little tongue twisted with words. Then I get frustrated with myself because I’m afraid of expressing myself. 

I often compare myself to others because it seems that everyone else can get out of situations and negotiate making themselves stand out with others. I kinda wish I could do the same as I am used to being forgotten and ignored.

"Really fuckin late to the socially awkward party here,  but I wanted to go to a concert last week (Alice Cooper, WI state fair? Hell yes!) But I didnt have any friends who wanted to go, and the last time I was at a concert with someone, they said ""I'll be right back"" and then I just stood there for 20+ minutes by myself with my hands in by pockets glancing nervously around at the rest of the crowd (who were all too focused on the band to care what I was doing, but it felt like everyone was staring at me and I almost cried), so instead of going to see Alice Cooper, I sat at home and watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer with my cat.

Now I have free tickets to go see Mastodon next month, and once again, am having a hard time finding anyone to go with me (except for another friend who has never been to a concert because he's socially anxious and freaks out in crowds, so he might not go either), and even though I really want to go, I'm seriously contemplating just passing the tickets off go someone else who will have a better time because they're not an anxious wreck :)

Its not wanting to get out of bed to go to work because I think maybe I did something wrong yesterday and I'm gonna get yelled at as soon as I walk in the door

It's seeing an old coworker out in public and wanting to ask if they want to go out and grab a beer  sometime but even though you were really close before, and have some fantastic memories from when you worked together, you haven't actually talked to each other in a long time, and no matter how bad you want to reconnect, you just can't bring yourself to say ""hey there! Haven't talked to you in a while, how's it been?"" Because maybe the reason you haven't heard from them is because they think you're annoying and they only pretended to like you because you were stuck together at work

It feels like everybody is pissed off at you all the time, and you don't know what you did wrong

It feels like everybody is looking at you, and you don't know why - maybe i have something on my face, or there's toilet paper stuck to my shoe, or maybe these clothes aren't as flattering as I thought they were when I put them on this morning, and my makeup looks like I put it on without looking in a mirror - am I wearing too much makeup and look like a cheap white-trash hooker? Maybe I didn't put on any makeup today, and I look like a gross dumpster. Is my hair sticking up funny?

If feels like wanting to be part of a community of people who like the same sorts of things that you do, but then you see them talking about how much they hate that one thing, and you don't know why everyone hates that thing because you think that thing is kinda cool, but its not cool to like that thing, so you don't feel like you can join in on the conversation and be part of the community because you like that thing, and you shouldn't because no one else does and you don't know why

It feels like you're inadequate, and even though you know that you spelled ""inadequate""right, you've reread your post so many times making sure that its perfect, so now ""inadequate"" doesn't look like a real word anymore, so you're just going to go back and change it all to ""not good enough"" so you don't look like a dumb idiot who can't spell things right"
"Everything you say, and I mean everything, is wrong/weird. That's how I feel anyway. "
"Imagine second guessing why your friends are including you in their plans. Are they genuinely wanting to spend time with you or do they feel obligated because you seem like you're always alone? 

Imagine choosing the self checkout lane at the store because you are terrified of the potential conversation the cashier might try to start. 

Imagine wanting to participate in a conversation, but overthinking everything you want to say because you want to make sure it's relevant and doesn't make you sound stupid, so the conversation moves on without you. 

Imagine feeling like shit every time someone mentions how quiet you are because of the previous sentence.

Now imagine this in EVERY social interaction in your life. "
texting is hard in particular - ill type stuff out and then erase it and repeat this over and over. then when i finally send it i feel like throwing my phone across the room and not looking at it for hours.

"It's a feeling of utter desperation and paralysis. I spend all but perhaps 1-2 hours a week of my free time alone. I am fine in work situations, but socially I shut down. I feel trapped between utter loneliness and a desperation for companionship but a complete inability to mingle with others so as to meet anyone for friendship or more. I see Meetups I want to join and be part of but can't bring myself to go into the events. I stopped trying. I've accepted that I will be alone. My life will end alone."
"I just have kinda normal anxiety that can influence how I perceive social situations. Every person who looks at me is Scary™️. Every loud noise is Scary™️. Every person I don’t know who wants to talk to me for some reason is a Scary Threat™️. Some days are better than others, but on the days that are bad, simply asking for chopsticks can leave me with full-body shakes.

My best friend, however, is a whole other story. He has social anxiety so bad that some days I don’t even know how to talk to him. He is so, so afraid of social situations that when he orders food, he nearly whispers it and ends it with a question mark. He stumbles over his words a ton because he’s afraid if he’s too clear, he’ll sound demanding, and if he sounds demanding, he’ll be hurting the person, and if he’s hurting the person, they’ll hate him, and if they hate him, HE’S BAD™️.

My poor bud has been like that basically his entire life, since he was a really young kid. It’s affected almost all of his relationships and chances of forming new ones. Most days he can’t eat without his body immediately wanting to reject the food, thanks to his good ol’ pal anxiety. (He has more than just social anxiety too, but it’s all kind of a big circle for him.) I think he said he’s going to try a medication (an SSRI, not a benzo) for the first time and I really hope it works for him. He often says that he doesn’t even feel like a “real human being” because his social skills are so out of whack."
"Overthinking basic social cues. Wondering if I’m saying the right thing. Questioning my nonverbals. Basically lack of confidence fueled by a lot of self doubt.

I know deep down the look she gave could have been for any number of reasons, but my neurotic mind has already convinced itself that I'm being judged. I'm suddenly aware of everything I do, even simple things like breathing. Am I acting normal? I HAVE to act normal. This paranoia is often accompanied by physical symptoms - my face feels warm and red, my palms feel sweaty, hands might tremble, and my stomach churns. My vision becomes insanely acute, unable to take in everything around me, but rather compelled to focus only on very specific details. This renders me only able to guess what the people around me, outside of my direct line of sight are doing. I soon convince myself they must be staring at me, talking about me (negatively of course), thinking they're better than me. A friend will say something to me that I will barely register, but still, after some delayed time, it will bring me partially back into the world. I try to compose myself, pretend as though I'm perfectly fine. My response is usually a very calculated but difficult-to-get-out one. I may stammer over a word or two and once hat happens a new wave of anxiety washes over me because of it. I want to go home. I want to leave this place and go somewhere safe. I want to disappear.

This is my anxiety. Some days it's worse than others. Some days I fear even mowing the front lawn because of the people in the cars that will drive by. Why? Because they'll judge me. Some days I'm the most confident guy around, even having my cockiness or swagger pointed out. Most of my friends don't even know that I suffer from social anxiety. Many of them refuse to believe I do when I tell them. I've become a master of masking how I truly feel. I fit in everywhere and nowhere all at once. But in those moments when I wear a mask, I'm miserable deep down inside. The only time I'm comfortable socially without exception is when I'm in the company solely of very close friends or family."
"Like I'm not good enough to be there. Is everyone always judging me? Logically I know they aren't... but what if they are? My sentences come out muddled. Even simple introductions, going around a table saying your name and something like your job title at orientations makes me so nervous that I end up doing something like mispronouncing my own name. In groups of friends I'm not really close with, I'll sit there quietly, afraid that if I say one of the many things running through my head, I'll end up sounding like an idiot. Sweating is also a problem in public because I'm just so nervous all the time.

However, I continuously try to not let my social anxiety stop me from what I want. I was my high school valedictorian, meaning that I spoke in front of thousands of people when in tenth grade I would just sit there shaking when I was called on in class. I killed that speech and it felt amazing. I've spoken to dignitaries from around the globe, forcing myself to speak up and try not to care what they think of me. I do it by trying to forget about what I'm doing until the moment I'm actually there. Spontaneity makes it so I can't talk myself out of doing something. That's why it's still so hard for me in groups of people, because there's so much time in my own head, I talk myself out of speaking. People definitely think I have a lot less to say because of it, and I don't put forward how accomplished/goofy/intelligent I can be.

Social anxiety is hard. It took me awhile to realize that not everyone feels the way I do. Meeting new people is hard. Small talk is really hard. Being alone is something I crave. Not everyone understands that I need to recharge. That's hard. I like to eat alone sometimes, which causes me to take a lot of time trying to find empty spaces, because I don't want people to judge me for being alone even if it is something I want. Even sitting in lectures alone. Even if it's something I want to do, I'm terrified to actually do it.

Social anxiety is like being asked on a date and turning it down because you fear they would only ever ask to make you the punchline. "
"I've thankfully gotten over most of my social anxiety, but a year or so ago I used to just have this crippling fear when in public--- especially in like a group of people that people would think I was upset, or that I looked like I was about to cry. Before that it was that my face would just start getting red in situations where I'm afraid of seeming embarassed--- and not actually embarassed, but feel myself vaguely get red and that spirals into out of control sweaty terribleness"
"I guess it depends on your level of it. For me, it's constant fear of looking stupid, being stupid, being touched, or just getting attention in general. Talking to people is hard because I'm always in fear of giving a bad impression, like a really bad one. Or being yelled at. Crowded places like stores feel like a minefield. I have to avoid everyone by a few feet to feel decently comfortable, and wish I could just go invisible so I'm not even looked at. I'm also really paranoid that everyone has the potential to really hurt me. Like, they do because you never know, but I'm even aware I take it to the extreme. People can't walk or stand behind me without me having to look to the side to just watch them from my peripheral for fear of them doing something to me. It's always horrible when people even compliment me. It's appreciated you took the time to notice something about me and be kind about it, but I'm sorry, I did not want the attention. The attention is honestly scary. Existing is scary. Even right now as I type this and other responses I can't help but fear others will think I'm overreacting or being stupid or something. Minor things all get blown up massively, and it's all just really terrifying."
"It feels like I'm always messing things up when I'm talking to someone or in a social situation. Here's an example: one time my friend came over to the flat and he went in for a hug while I was a step above him so I leaned down for the hug. In my head I was thinking ""he probably thinks I'm being condescending to him."" I later asked for another hug this time on level ground explaining it to him and he said that I was over thinking it. I started running out of the room apologizing to him while i was thinking I was an idiot. Luckily he's a great supportive friend and knows how to handle me when I'm like that."
"I do a lot of educating in my job--one on one conversation with someone, almost always older than me, making eye contact in close proximity. I truly have no idea what I actually tell my patients. When I begin explanations, all I hear is how I'm speaking too quickly, my words being jumbled, every syllable that doesn't come out right, etc. I don't know how much is actually happening and how much is just my mind being too focused on that vs what I'm actually saying? I don't know how to describe it. Everything goes fuzzy and I completely lose my train of thought. Nobody has yet to be like ""wtf did you just say to me?"" so I'm hoping it's just all in my mind."
"Awful.

:("
Imagine walking into a crowded room. At first you just hear one of the conversations. Then another comes into focus. And another. Eventually. You hear all the conversations in the room in excruciating detail. And then they all start shouting. And somebody is playing music. And then they're all playing music.
"I start over-thinking situations, often it gets so bad that I start sweating and break out in hives on my hands.
When it gets really bad I start crying and hyperventilating. Truly. It's a great time."
Feel like you don't fit in
"It’s sucks. Constantly nervous and have a bad feeling in your stomach. All I ever wanna do is go out and make some new friends and have a good time, but then I psych myself out and end up not doing anything but staying in and watching Netflix where I feel safe"
"Me, I feel attacked all the time. I tend to take things very personally even when I know I shouldn't. "
I wanted to tell somebody that I worked with that there artwork was good and for a solid three days I waited until I finally got the courage to do so. If that isn't social anxiety I don't know what is. 
Leaving the house is something you have to psyche yourself up for. Going out and meeting people is physically painful. Telephone calls feel like getting ready for a vaccine shot. If the person at the drive thru couldn't hear you on the first try you stutter through the rest of the order and forget things. Volume is no longer under your control. If it gets combined with other mental issues you have it can go as far as believing other people are watching or listening to you so you change your behaviour to suit what you believe they want. They can possibly even hear your thoughts and judge you for what you have the ability to do. 50 contingency plans for something you will never have the guts to do etc. 
I feel like I’m constantly trying to do my best impression of what others expect my normal self to be and that in turn makes me more awkward and uncomfortable. 
"Well it definitely doesn't help when your workplace talks major shit about you. You just have to not give a damn, take what they said into account then toss all of that outta your head because it's bullshit. If your dealing with an asshole who just projects his/her feelings/thoughts then maybe just fuck em. They're probably on some psychotic spectrum if they feel the need to include you in their crappy perspective. Whatever you think that might be, personally I'd just ask if there is a problem. Pussies will clamp up, others might give subtle hints which is pathetic, and a very few will voice an opinion. Just dont walk in the middle of the of the street like some fool who believes themselves to be ""the main character of life/their life"", those dumbasses should get run over."
"When you're going to a family reunion, going to be around relatives (people you've met at least a few times before) and you STILL need a Xanax."
"I'll assume you're either asking this because you don't have feelings of social anxiety, or do, and wish to find other people with similar problems.

Well I'll describe how I normally feel, and act in public.

I personally feel as though I'm always being judged, and judging myself as I worry so. 

I try to glance around a room to see if anyone's staring at me, and glance away when they do. It makes me feel uncomfortable, and I generally tend to default my gaze downward in attempts to ignore the supposed onlookers. 

Everything I do is rude, stupid, or bad in some sense. If I'm in a store I'm shoplifting, if I'm in a restaurant I'm disgusting other customers, if I'm at a park I'm being too lazy. Nothing is ever right, and it extends to playing games with others, or even speaking with them as well. My friends often get annoyed by my frequent apologies, and awkward behaviors. Though in person with friends, and family I'm capable of being much more confident, so long as there are no strangers.

I'm often spoken over, soft-spoken, and experience stuttering. With a lot of ""uh""s, ""um""s, clicks, pauses, and sighs mixed into my speech.

Idk. Perhaps I'm not anxious, but merely aggressively self loathing."
"Imagine family Christmas lunch/dinner, but every moment of your life."
I actually don’t remember anymore. I outgrew it a long time ago. That’s the crazy thing about memories. If you go a long time without doing or experiencing something you forget. Same with living with something for a long time. You end up not being able to explain it well.
"The best example I ever heard given was here on reddit, something along the lines of ""it's like your spidey sense is going off for no fucking reason at all"""
"I am a loud brash and often wild person.... until I have to ask someone for something, even talking to waiters and people manning the registers. I know its there job but it feels so weird. "
"It's very hard for me to see how other people can operate, they just go up to a counter and order food without having to look at the menu and practice what you want in your head 100 times...like people actually go up to other people and start conversations? With complete strangers? That's wild...I don't like to draw attention to myself, things like asking strangers for directions, is impossible, you the think..it's so easy, all I hAve to do is open my mouth, but you physically cannot do it!! You just can't! Have you ever tried to do something, but you can't? It's very hard to deal with...it should be so easy! I hate it when people say, ""you just need to get over it!"" That's like say, you can't lift a 400lb weight, no matter how much you want to, you physically can't...it kinda feels that way,..idk if any of this makes
Sense...also if you're in a theatre or something and you're blocked in, panic mode...no one seems to understand...it's easy for them, so you're just being a baby...like my heart is racing, I'm sweaty, I'd rather be hit by a car than make this phone call...I hope you understand my rambles "
Sometimes I start to cry in super markets while getting cheese because there’s too many people 
"Imagine saying something really idiotic to the love of your life, imagine that but you react like that to everyone, no matter what you said."
"-Reading very deep into random words or actions people take/say, this can go on for hours

-Not really knowing what to say in a conversation or how to say it--> sounding awkward

-cold sweats at the thought of asking someone out, breaking silences, etc

Long story short, social anxiety is social confusion that leads to a general feeling of inadequacy when dealing with other people. 

To those suffering from it, all I can say is that you just have to push through it and face it head on. There is no pill. There is no neat mental trick. There is coping but that's a bandaid solution that only extends the suffering for you and others. I did speech and debate all through high school. I was absolute *dogshit* at it for 3 years. I was constantly made fun of behind my back by people I competed against. 

Now I'm in college and things are working out pretty well. I've made tons of friends. You just have to try. "
You're afraid of something simple. And you KNOW it's stupid but you just dont want to deal with the shame of making a social faux pau so you dont even try half the time or have to psych yourself up to do it. 
"     social anxiety is absolutely terrible. social anxiety is not just being shy , antisocial or introverted. it’s much worse than that. it’s not a normal way to feel like this all the time and it’s not something everyone experiences.
    social anxiety can make you feel like everything you do or say is “weird” or “stupid”. you will start to believe that everyone thinks you’re weird , everyone hates you and everyone thinks you’re annoying. i’m always stuck in a spot asking people if they think i’m annoying. obviously this just makes them think i’m more annoying than they supposedly did before.
    social anxiety makes you very aware of what you’re doing and saying at all times. you have to be alert of what you’re doing because you’re afraid people are watching you and judging you. you think everyone will think you’re doing something wrong or you just look weird and awkward.
    with social anxiety you’re always nervous. you could just be going to the movies with your best friends or meeting someone for the first time you’re just ALWAYS nervous before you go/while you’re going there/while you’re there. you could be with someone you’re very comfortable with but you’ll still be alert of everything you do.
    when you have social anxiety you make the worst out of things. let’s say you’re signing up for a new sport you’ve never done before. none of your friends are going to be with you. before you go to your first practice you’re thinking of everything you could do wrong. you’re thinking about what you’re going to sag and what you’re going to do once you get there. you’re going to make embarrassing situations in your head that will NEVER happen but since you always make the worst out of things that are supposed to be fun you’ll never stop thinking about the negative.
    like an average person talking in front of people could make you nervous sometimes if you’re not confident enough or not ready. with social anxiety you can barely eat in front of others without them judging you thinking you’re eating too much or you’re eating too little. doing anything with your own ability like playing an instrument , writing or drawing can be frightening. even if you think you’re good at these things (which you probably don’t because you have a very low confidence) you will always think the other person thinks you’re terrible at your abilities.

"A lot of it manifests physically, which adds even more fear. For example, I know I'm going to be standing in front of the class to give a presentation, so I'm going to sweat, shake, and blush. Now I need to figure out what to wear to hide those things (makeup, scarf, dark shirt, pants with pockets) or else worry about  those on top of my initial anxiety about presenting.

It prevents new friendships and strains old ones. It makes dating impossible. It reduced my grades in courses I'd otherwise ace, and now prevents me from getting through job interviews. It makes me fixate on unpleasant memories and face terror if/when they repeat.

It forced me to make myself into someone I like, though.

I'm very slowly improving, which is terrifying in a different way: My still-existent anxiety has me terrified that I will get over my social anxiety only to continue struggling with platonic/familial/romantic relationships. I've always blamed my anxiety for my failures, and now that I'm improving, my current small failures feel increasingly personal."
Anxious.
Not ever being able to relax in public... or heavy social areas
Like having a pair of headphones on where someone is yelling at you in rapid Spanish but you're also trying to have a conversation with someone
"Fears and insecurities come as one. 

In you're mind you are always thinking of the worst of every interaction. Somewhere in your mind you have things you want to say but it becomes skewed. Just a ton of overthinking and insecurities in your own thoughts. This is all what goes through my mind. The fears of being judged and hurt.   
In the end you lose opportunities that you wish you didn't lose. The chances to change becomes harder as you live everyday, attempting to overcome. Full of regrets. That's just me. And my unfortunate social paranoia."
"I went to the shops today, kinda feeling better knowing other people feel the same way about thinking everyone thinks you’re shoplifting and trying to be more positive. Then when I left my favourite store Decjuba I literally heard the shop assistant say to the other “was she wearing that when she came in?” And the other said “yeah I’ve been casing her.” Wtf??!! I am going to go ahead and try not to let this make me paranoid....."
Thinking of every single possible other way a conversation could have gone; after the conversation happened.
You ever cried because you accidentally stepped in front of someone's cart at the grocery store? Yeah that
"You think everyone hates you. They hate everything you say and do, you’re alwaus wrong. It hurts."
"Like you’re in a cage with an open door and you’re frantically searching for keys you don’t even need. It’s rough. I constantly worry about how I am perceived by others. It alters most things about me. I obsess over the clothes I’m wearing, what my voice sounds like, how intelligent (or dumb) I sound, my walk, ... and so much more. I feel extremely embarrassed over situations that others could laugh off. I avoid talking to people, especially people older than me. There have been several occasions where I was supposed to talk to a teacher after class and just didn’t resulting in a lower grade. And the worst part is knowing that I need to do things but not getting them done. It’s like a barrier I have to cross just to function like normal. Also, I’m an extrovert. Once I get going, I love being around other people. I long for relationships and feel lonely a lot. I do have a good friend who is also socially anxious but that can only cover so much. Unless something changes, I don’t know how I’ll ever meet a guy :("
"I went to Catholic School. We went on field trips. Sometimes it would be free dress. Sometimes it would be in our uniforms.

I showed up more then once to field trips with the wrong outfit. 

That’s social anxiety. Wearing a uniform when everyone else is in jeans. And that’s what I’m afraid of every time I go outside. "
"The most accurate description I've ever heard for the *feeling* --like inside your body-- of social anxiety, kind of just anxiety in general was as follows:
""It's like expecting to be at the bottom of the stairs but missing a step, but that feeling doesn't go away""

I tend to think of my anxiety as two separate parts that are linked and sometimes effect each other.

On one hand, there's what is actually my social anxiety, where I psych myself out and over think every single action, calculate every last step of how I present myself, and then assuming I don't freak myself out so much that I change my mind on going to an event, there's the whole after part where I continue to over think, but now about conversations I had. Every little mistake I made sticks in my brain and burns itself into place. Especially if I stammered (something I do a lot if I'm in an uncomfortable situation), or rambled too much.

Then there's the pure anxiety part, which is usually triggered by the social anxiety, but not always. It's where I get my panic attacks, in which I will break down in tears, completely inconsolable because of just how badly I feel about myself and everything I've done wrong or couldn't control. I'm kind of an oddity in that most people when they have breakdowns like that want to be left alone, but in those moments I want nothing more than to just be held. No words, just held (I think it stems from an uncontrollable unbearable fear of lonliness, which of course is one of the biggest causes of my anxiety lol ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).

But yeah, anxiety in general, be it social, personal, or both (especially both): -100/10 would never recommend."
"I’m mostly agoraphobic in my social anxiety. It’s almost as if I’m walking and interacting with wild animals — gotta act like nothing’s wrong, while I’m scared to death of being mauled..."
"It feels like you're taped in a room with no air, yet everyone around you is breathing fine."
"With a lot of good points I see in this post, there are also the times when you're talking to someone and you just kinda feel like you're not in your body anymore. The words you are saying are yours, it just doesn't feel like you're what's making them actually come out. You're on autopilot somehow. I do this if I have to leave my house and talk to someone I don't know. Registering my son for school last week was a nightmare. I can't cope with the fact that I'm now the adult."
"Being concerned that this thread might trigger my anxiety, scrolling past it, reprimanding myself for not clicking on it. Scrolling back and reading this while wincing just waiting for something to make me anxious. "
"For example.

today i was sitting at a table. i kept trying to say something to this guy . but it wouldn't come out. and I over thought it way too much and i eventually had to leave. and felt depressed and suicidal the rest of the day for being such a fucking failure"
"My mouth is sealed by something even though nothings there. Feeling you are being judge even though nobody cares. I just feel constant fear, I'm alot better though with meds and such."
"It's constantly living in petrifying fear. Doing simple things such as walking down the halls at school or work are an uphill battle, a battle between you and the impending stress and panic. To you, everyone is out to get you, and you do everything in your power to avoid interaction, to the point where you practically isolate yourself, just to avoid what you believe is incoming ridicule. you feel judged everywhere you go. Nowhere is home to you. You feel as if every person closest to you has betrayed you without you even knowing it. You feel like you can't disclose what you're going through to others because they'll think you're seeking attention or trying to gain sympathy. There's also people who claim to have social anxiety just to excuse them being a little shy around people. Social anxiety isn't just being shy or introverted. It is the literal fear of people. No matter what you do, you always feel you could've handled the situation in a different, better way, and it plagues your mind for hours, days, even weeks or months afterwards. You dread talking to people and look for any and every excuse to evade being anywhere where social interaction, or the very possibility of it, is present. When you talk you shake. You rehearse every little moment of a conversation in your head in advance. You're afraid to say you have social anxiety because of the fact that it is most commonly not taken as seriously as it should (it's often brushed off as you being ""a bit shy""). People who suffer from social anxiety like us are misunderstood, brushed off, and neglected in favor of those with more boisterous personalities. Getting a boyfriend or girlfriend is next to impossible because of the fact that social anxiety manifests a ""only speak if spoken to"" mindset. We daydream about the day when we find a partner to take us under their wing rather than seeking that moment out because of the crippling fear of possible ridicule or judgement we'll face when trying to form new relationships. We spend our days alone (or wishing to be left alone). No one makes an effort to understand this plague as they'll merely sweep it under the rug in favor of thinking you're ""stuck up"", ""rude"", or ""just a bit quiet"". Social anxiety does not equal shyness. In the slightest. It's the extreme manifestation of the mindset that everyone is your enemy."
"In my case, my first symptom was needing a period of quiet / rest after taking my daily classes in college. Too much talking / listening made my head ache. I felt I needed to uncompress.

Then, you wake up one day and your mind goes through the list of things you have to do, and you realise you're reluctant to many of them because you don't feel like talking to other people. You start posponing them, even phonecalls or e-mails. Even to friends. 

At the same time, you feel very lonely. You wish you were this kind of ""outside people"" who spend their day with friends and family, and only return home to sleep. You crave contact, but at the same time fear it and feel inadequate. You don't have the right clothes. You need to shave and shower. You won't know what to talk about. In the end, you fear it will make you feel more lonely and out of touch than before. Why try it? You politely decline invitations until they stop coming.

In the end, the list of ""can't""s becomes too large, and you look for outside help. I started seeing a therapist once I did realise I was the only one to blame for my situation."

Wow. Just realized I have social anxiety.

We don’t even need to write a comment this sums it up so perfectly.
"Omg the paranoid ‘everyone is watching how I ___’ thing! That was a big thing in college, for me. Everyone was watching how I walked across campus. Everyone was watching how I bent down to get a pen that fell on the floor. Everyone was watching and judging, so all my movements had to be perfect — otherwise, if not, then they’d all judge me as ‘lesser’."
Every single word is accurate. Holy cow is this accurate. Literally needs a more literal term than this. It's.......I want to gold you but I'm broke.
That first paragraph is me to a tee ... didn’t think I had social anxiety 
All this time..
Only thing I don’t get is why what the other person thinks matters in the slightest. Even if I thought everyone was watching me why would their opinions matter
"this is it.  i'll get invited to a house party, and unless i'm going to a mutual friend's house first for a pre-drink, i'll procrastinate from going... i'll get dressed to go, have my coat and boots on and just stand in the doorway silently thinking of all the weird shit that'll happen when i go... who'll be there... i won't know anyone... okay maybe i will, but nobody will care that i'm there... maybe i should just go back to playing games... just one more match.  2 hours later, ""no i should really go now...""  get in the car... sit there without turning it on... ""people are going to wonder why i'm so late... do i tell them i'm depressed?  am i depressed?  is this anxiety, why am i broken?  naw, i'm not depressed, this isn't anxiety, i'm just tired and not really 'feeling it'...   ...why am i even asking this then?  nights when i'm having fun i dont' ask these questions... why can't tonight be like THOSE nights?"" 

i either go back inside, order a pizza and when people ask monday why i didn't show up, i apologize with ""something came up, sorry, hope it was still fun!""  or i Will suck it up, and manage to show up at to the place and find Someone to talk to and INSTANTLY feel better making small talk with a beer in hand - and wonder what the fuck i was so afraid of... it makes ZERO fucking sense.

and you never talk to anyone about it because it makes no sense.

best i can relate it to is being 6 years old and asked to grab a bucket from the garage after dark, and you're standing there in the quiet evening, with the shadows of the trees and the garage creaking, and all you can think about are the many times of monsters that could get you.  maybe a bunch of small bugs, maybe  GIANT one, maybe a bear with a human face, maybe a human with a bear face... maybe something stretched out like a real fuckin living horror.  then you run back inside and tell your parents you couldn't get the bucket because you're scared, and they get mad and roll their eyes, but it's easier to deal with letting people down than it is dealing with your fears.

so yeah... having a friend who's also going, and meeting up with them for a drink first is always best.  because then you're talking those monsters together."
This is it. A lot of the replies on here sound more like people with poor social skills than people with social anxiety. It isn't shyness. You can enjoy socializing while being socially anxious and you described it perfectly.
"I have that one friend that understands my anxiety. He is aware of my social anxiety, and invites me out but understands my pace.  He'd come hangout at my play some video games, go out for dinner, then since we're already out we might as well go to the bar with some buddies later. The process really freed me from anxious thoughts.

Now that I moved to a small town for work, I have no idea what to do with myself.  "
"Or just every time you see someone that you know. It's like a battle every time on whether I should say hi, and when I do when everything always turns out fine. It is just that internal battle. "
"You know that feeling in your stomach before you have to give a public presentation? Yeah, imagine feeling that just about anywhere that involves people."
Yes. Exactly. 
"Also the fact that deep down you know that you *could* be a successful, happy, likable person but you never will be because your irrational, uncompromising fear of people will always hold you back. This leads to depression.

And then the fact that for a lot of people getting drunk is like an instant cure for social anxiety which leads to alcoholism since some people will happily choose that over constant loneliness and emptiness."
"> You may be suspicious that people/friends hate you for some very random reason, usually made up by your own mind.

You know what's really messed up, when you don't think that and it turns out someone actually does dislike you. Pretty much one of only two people I regularly played games with and found out after I asked why I was removed from the Monster Hunter World squad he was leader of. The kicker is that his problem with me was something he completely imagined."
"The worst is when someone says ""Why don't you talk more?"" because then I'm even more aware of my anxiety and don't know how to respond.

Also, other people who have social anxiety (or at least don't talk a lot) make me anxious.  There are a couple guys at work who are kind of quiet/awkward and I never know what to say to them.  I get the sense that they think I don't like them, but I actually do, I just can't bring myself to talk to them without feeling super anxious."
"I saw this question and was like “Oh, finally, one I can answer!” But I scroll down and see this comment and it’s just absolutely 1000x better than any description I could write. So fucking perfectly done.

The one part where you say that you are suspicious  people hate you for some random reason is very relatable. I’m afraid to text people because I fear they secretly hate me. Life’s tough."
"This.

All of this.

And then feeling anxious about your anxiety. An actual living nightmare. "
"> You are crushing on that girl for 3 years, it's killing you but you will seek for 1001 stupid reasons not to ask her out.

I finally got up the nerve to talk to my crush of a year only for her to blow me off entirely. The rejection itself doesn’t hurt that much but this instance will make my anxiety a lot worse in the future  "
Yeah I think you covered it all. I don't want to type out what I think because of social anxiety.
"You know, up until now I was questioning whether I really had social anxiety. Maybe I was just trying to make excuses for myself, or trying to feel special. But nope, reading this, every single of those is much too familiar. 

Thanks for saying this. At least that's one less thing to worry about."
"And if you're lonely, you may want to get friends, but don't know how. Maybe once in a while you'll get an emotional boost, sudden belief that you can do it and that you will do it.. but when it comes to it, reality kicks in - you just can't."
"Agree with everything said here. To add to that, in my experience you're constantly on the lookout for anything to reaffirm your existing (usually irrational) fears. If you push yourself outside your comfort zone, the moment conversation gets awkward, or someone doesn't reply to a message, anything like that, it gives you a reason to double down on everything you've feared and makes things worse.

"> You are reluctant to speak to people, even if you have something in my mind. Because, for some reason, you are afraid of saying something stupid.

Or you're afraid you'll be bothering them. Or you think they already find you annoying (despite the fact that there is no evidence to back that up) and don't want to annoy them more.

> You may be suspicious that people/friends hate you for some very random reason, usually made up by your own mind.

Yep. ""They're only being nice to me because they feel sorry for me"" or ""They're only nice to me because they have to be."""

Always thought I had social anxiety and this post confirms it.
Not being able to order your own food at a restaurant. I’m 20 and still have to get one of my siblings to do it for me. 
"Ill provide a mental image of social anxiety, at least for me: imagine every time you want to hang out with people, or even say hi to someone, or want to start talking to that girl/boy you are attracted to, you feel a force inside of you that is constantly, and slowly becoming more powerful, pulling you away from the situation: like a leash on a dog.

I'll also add an aspect of social anxiety that seems to confuse the hell out of people, as well as make some people think I hate them. When I'm walking around, I tend to feel a lot more comfortable around people I don't know, but if I see someone that I know, even if I had only learned their name in class, I would take a completely different path just so that I would not have to engage. Two weird things about this though: I only feel anxiety thinking about having the conversation, if I have the conversation, I am completely fine, and this anxiety does not occur toward 3 very specific people. Social Anxiety is weird and is absolutely annoying to deal."
"Not too brag but try this and also not be a sterotypical ""loser"" ie you're good looking, in shape, intelligent and cultured. It feels like I've wasted my best years in anxiety. All those people who vyed for my friendship, all the women who've desired me. Again it sound like I'm humble bragging but I am very distraught by this. If I was a typical neckbeard I'd probably feel like ""oh we this is just how it goes for us"" but I'm not and it hurts that I'm in the prime of my youth watching it fade with weak friendships, no love life and a future that is pointing toward a swinging rope.

The worst is when you're walking funny and you just know everybody is noticing it so you gotta focus and make sure you're not walking funny but now it looks like you're trying to hard and not being natural and they can tell you're starting to panic

"One might also have flashbacks about their actions during socially uncomfortable situations or of individual conversations where they say the wrong thing (as evidenced by an uncomfortable response or lack of enduring connection), maybe even replay them over in their head years later but pretend to give give better answers. In some social interactions where they felt belittled or marginalized, those mental reenactments might include some kind of fantasized confrontation or escalated (verbal) aggression."

"> You may be suspicious that people/friends hate you for some very random reason, usually made up by your own mind.

I've got a friend, who I don't hang out with as much as other friends, but I always get on with him whenever we're talking. He said to me once ""People like you, like a lot"". Honestly it was a) one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to me and b) one of the most helpful things anyone has ever said to me. Whenever I'm feeling particularly socially anxious, and doubting that people who are clearly friends secretly hate me I just replay that comment in my mind.

I like to think he knew exactly what he was saying and chose the perfect words."
"Also, anyone who laughs in your vicinity, laughs about you."
"I overcame the invitation thing, I've always said yes, for years

"Really good overview, it's kind of comforting to know I'm not the only one who does the ""suspecting your friends actually hate you"" thing. Underlines that I can be like 99% sure it's just my imagination."
"""i want to be invited but i dont want to go when the time comes"""
"That fear of people secretly hating you is literally my life right now, especially since school is about to start back up. I spend soo much of my time replaying every interaction I've had, and always convince myself that I did something weird/bad to make people dislike me. Or that people are just nice to my face. Just the thought of going back to school is making me start shaking oof."

I feel personally attacked

I wish I had that problem. I don't get invited anywhere very often because I never do. But when I do, I hardly ever turn it down even despite my anxiety."
Huh. I never knew this had a name. I’d always scoffed at social anxiety but I guess I played myself. It was like a checklist the whole way down. 
"Holy shit. That’s what’s wrong with me..... 

Damn."
This seems more like social anxiety compounded with depression. My social anxiety is quite different. I guess i'm just fine with being alone.
"> People invite you somewhere. At first, you feel like going, but anxiety kicks in and you turn the request down. Nobody ever invites you anymore, that makes you depressed and more anxious.

This

This. This right here.

It happens all the time to me, every friend, every situtation, I always have that line of thought on my head. And I'm afraid to ask, either if my fear is true and to appear as an asshole.

It's fucking painful man."
"> It’s not even based in logic. I know that these people like being around me. I know that if they didn’t like me, they would leave me alone. I know that I am likable and that people want to know me. 

Now imagine how do you feel when you undoubtedly realise that those people don't actually care about you, but are kind enough to just tolerate your presence. Absolutely crushing."
"Something I posted before that many people found helpful (and not directed at you specifically):

I think this is the worst thing about depression/self-confidence issues. Your brain focuses on all of these negative things about yourself and exaggerates them to the point that that's all you can see. So, when you meet people who genuinely like and care about you, you can't help but be skeptical. You think about all those negative things and think, ""How could they possibly like me?"" Then you start to think they're just entertaining you, or taking pity on you, or barely tolerate you. And that leads to you to start looking for any little thing that reaffirms that. They were busy and couldn't hang out tonight? They obviously just don't want to put up with you.

Best realization I ever came to with this is that it's hard to accept other people liking you until you learn to like yourself. These skeptical thoughts are ultimately projection, and you're just assuming other people think about things the same way you do. You see something bad, so they must see it too and think it just as bad, if not worse. Even people with healthy minds have trouble seeing things from someone else's perspective, but we have an even more difficult time of it because we have something poisoning our thoughts, causing us to automatically go to the worst possibility.

People will often tell you to not give a fuck about what other people think, and perhaps that's true to some degree (at least, don't focus on it to you own detriment), but the more important thing is: Give a fuck what **you** think. I know it sounds trite and pithy to say, but you need to work on yourself - whether through therapy, exercise, finding new interests, etc. Once you begin to recognize the good qualities you have, it'll become easier to accept what your friends and family are saying. And perhaps you'll begin to see that you are a worthwhile person who deserves friends and that there is a reason you have them now.

BATHROOM LURKERS UNITE
I felt exactly like this once at a college party/gathering I went to when staying a couple days with my cousin while she was still in college. The party was at her then boyfriends house and the only person I really knew was my cousin because I’d only ever said hi to her boyfriend a couple times and he wasn’t the type of person I would have normally hung out with. I felt like a cornered animal and took residence in one spot on the couch most of the night. Talked to maybe a couple people at most and just really felt alone. I finally got the courage to walk outside and call up one of my friends on the phone just to have someone I know to talk to. My cousin found me outside like that a bit later.
">  I just want to leave as soon

"Completely agree. Also, conferences (aka parties where you're forced to talk to important people to ""network"") are my nightmare for this reason. Imagine being paralyzed with fear before making a big life decision or skydiving or something. Social anxiety is like that, but shows up when you have to do normal things like talking to new people. When you know the people are important or knowledgeable or just farther along in their career than you, it's absolutely excruciating. I feel like I'm the most awkward person in the world and just want to crawl under a table and hide. "
"This was a video that helped me think of it differently. Not sure if it could help:

"There is exactly one way for a beginner to enjoy a party. Take it or leave it. You need to concentrate with all you might on maintaining fine balance between being dumb and obnoxious.

3. A lot of my close friends can't go

" > I hide in the bathroom or try to be invisible. It's so painful!

I feel your pain. I've been there. I was invited to my long time friend whose getting married. I end up having a severe melt down while on the dinner table I went straight to the bathroom stall and stood there for at least 20 minutes.

Worst of all. I had someone on my phone if I'm in this situation, because I gave her a headsup I might just crash during this dinner gathering. I msged her immediately that ""I'm dying"", she instantly replied to me. But I was in such a panic I didn't even realized she even replied back and after 30 minutes passed by, I felt soooooooo baaaad that she was there for me, and I didn't even reply her back. So when I realized this, I just said ""It's okay, I'll be okay. Thanks for being there. I'll msg you tomorrow, good night."" Even though it was at that moment I really needed someone to talk to the most! It was such a pain."
"Same.  I am very articulate when writing, but I can not get the words out when I'm speaking.  My mind just goes blank when I talk, especially if it is a situation where I have to express myself.  If I'm talking about the weather or sports or giving a technical explanation of how to do something, I'm fine, but if I have to give my opinion on something or talk about how I'm feeling, then I get all anxious and can't speak."
I feel ya. You have trouble falling asleep too? I'll lay in bed and replay my day and do the well i shouldve said or i couldve done or i actually tried to join a conversation and everyone talked over me like i didnt say anything. Thats one that i dread over all the time. I finally try to contribute to conversation and its like i never spoke. 
"i get this! sometimes i'll start talking fine but once i look round and see multiple people listening to me my brain panics and starts throwing words out in the wrong order, or just the wrong fcking words all together."

"Dang, agree with this. Only meet people through others that im forced to interact with (coworkers mainly). If i have to meet new people I am very scared and get tired quickly. I want to connect with people like I see other people doing, but the effort it takes to overcome myself is too much and I just avoid people in general. "
How does someone know if they have social anxiety because this describes my social habits to a T but I’ve had many people describe me as an extrovert.
This is exactly what I've been suffering from. It gets worse when I'm in a large group where my brain shuts down every social function I have.
This was me a month ago. The Conversation Code really helped me break down the art of interacting with people. Check it out and make sure you push yourself through the exercises! Good luck!!!
"Every bit of what the parent commenter said, now add on this unshakeable feeling of literal weight on your shoulders that never goes away unless your high or drunk or on meds (not to be confused with the same feeling because of stress this isn't stress weight its anxiety weight they feel the same but the difference being that even alone and unburdened with nothing going on and no worries its still present).

Now to address the friend thing, I learned and forced myself to socialize with people early on in my life because I knew eventually I'd need people to lean on in hard times, to open doors that would otherwise be closed, and for companionship. What I learned is the key trick the one that tops all the others and ***the one that works the best is that people want to be around people like them, that think like them, whose opinions match theirs, but more importantly they want other people to validate their opinions no matter how wrong or right they may be***.

The trick to using the information in the last paragraph is to mimic peoples behavior, vocally agree with their opinions, watch their favorite shows or sports.   
  Understand that what influences peoples opinion of you is how they perceive you(and your opinion of them by extension) if you come across as hostile with your first few encounters they're not gonna want anything to do with you (e.g. hating on their political ideas, saying their guy or team is a piece of shit, you hate that band thats on their t-shirt, their hair is atrocious etc.).
  Using the above knowledge I've made several friends from all walks of life, LGBT people, Racists, Criminals, Country people, people from different countries, people that I actually despise even thats how well this technique works it works so well that I actually had to stop trying it out on different people because I didn't want to accidentally shoehorn myself with a bad crowd and wind up a criminal.
  It works well because as I said earlier people want validation, they want to feel vindicated in their beliefs that they aren't a bad person and that their moral compass isn't out of whack and this is why you get cliques like goths, jocks, nerds, catty people, theatre geeks, people latch on to other people similar to theirselves because it makes them feel good about themself.

The best way to find friends is to find people interested in the same things you are, like computers? join a computer club, sports? join a team, shop class is a great way to network with future coworkers as well as learn a trade that you can use later in life, Join a team or a club, forums, or be me and hangout on IRC (freenode is an excellent place for people of like minds to shoot the breeze, ask for help or further explanations of topics you don't understand). 

Tl;dr : Making friends is as easy as copying their ideals and beliefs and behaviors because people want to be validated by others, finding friends is made easier by joining clubs, teams, forums or irc chat channels."

"My boyfriend has a ton of friends. Multiple groups. People he's known for over a decade. I can't hear him talking about getting together with a group without feeling *super* lonely. It's not his fault that I don't have a group of my own, and he should never feel bad about talking to me about his fun, but there are times I dwell on it too much and start to feel like shit. Which then makes me feel selfish, and the cycle repeats.

It sucks."
Yes
Recently became friends with somebody that’s pretty popular. Always feel like I am intruding or overstaying my welcome and get self conscious when I’m with them and their friends. 
I can relate to this so much. Unless I get to know each member of that group individually then I just don’t go into the group. 
This is basically me. I'm perfectly fine with one on one interactions but interrupting the flow of a group seems like a sin. 
"Its bad for me cause i want to participate but the what ifs, is what kills me. Only reason i can post on here is cause ive had a few beers. And ill wake up full of dread with the thought of someone judging me, and go to straight panic mode. Cause like you said,what if "
"That has gotten me into so many bad situations.

Once I was at an event that one of my (only) friends was supposed to be at but he never showed up, he didn't answer his phone or reply to text or anything. I was like ""what if he died, what if something happened to him??"" I kept looking at the door, expecting him to walk through it and put all these thoughts to rest but that never happened. I started to freak out and get on edge and get extremely worried. It wasn't until three very very long days that I was able to run into him at the church he worked at. Turns out he just fell asleep and woke up like half an hour before the event ended so he decided it wouldn't be worth it to show up for only 15 minutes."
That reminds me I also get eating/performance anxiety when eating around people I don't know to the point where my hand and mouth is shaking and I can't put the food in my mouth without looking awkward.
"That I'd beautifully put, the end description so perfectly captures it "
"The worst with talking is that this anxiety enhances bad emotions in a conversation. Let's say you're trying to find your way in life and stopped school for x reason. Every single time someone asks you about whatever you're doing in life a massive pit of guilt, fear, and self-loating forms. And it stays there for a long time. And every unpleasant conversation will create something similar. Sometimes you can't even keep talking because of it."

"> And the people who still interact with you don't necessarily help, because when they see you have difficulty and reach out, their solutions are to tell you that you're doing X wrong, you're wearing the wrong shoes, you need a haircut, you need to think about your career, you need to get married soon or you'll miss your chance to have kids. Pressure, pressure, more expectations, more judgments.

**Oh my god, yes!** There nothing more infuriating, and more existentially terrifying, than struggling with someone everyone else around you does with relative ease, and being told by these same people ""Have you tried [obvious thing]?"" or ""Don't worry, everyone struggles with X at first, you just need to get past the first hurdle!"".

The last one in particular makes you want to tear someone's eyes out. Like... you try the thing, again and again and again, and you get more desperate each time, because you rationalize that maybe the next conversation you'll have will be fun, maybe the next guy will pay attention to you and see you as a human being and not just a nuisance, but you know deep down that next time will work out exactly as well as the last 15 times, and you keep being proven right, and socializing becomes this insane process of doing the same thing over and over again and trying to ignore the rational voice in your head that tells you ""You're going to get the same results""...

...and you can *see* that other people do it easily, you can *see* that conversations work for them in a million subtle ways they don't work for you, and it's blindingly obvious that what's wrong with you goes beyond one or two things you're doing wrong, it's a whole set of issues in tone and behavior and body language and you know that the people telling you to ""Just get past your shyness and talk to people until you find someone who clicks"" have no idea what they're talking about and can't even comprehend that you're not fundamentally the same person as them, and something that incredibly easy to them is a soul-crushingly difficult for you."
That hit way to close to home. Damn. Couldn't have said it any better.
">you go into situations unprepared and balls them up

I've been there. Second guessing myself is a bad habit I have and I tried to solve it by being more decisive but I ended up becoming kind of impulsive, which isn't a very good solution at all. I ended up forcing myself to make decisions and deal with the aftermath as quickly as possible instead of giving myself time to think. One day my mother said to me ""you know, you could always just say you need more time"" and those words felt like some ancient magic to me."
"This post is perfect. I went to upvote you and saw the name, can't say I'm surprised. You put this beautifully. Thanks for helping put into words something I never have been able to myself."
"This perfectly describes it for me.

All of the other comments focus on the dread of the future and the discomfort of the present, but I think the worst part is the looming cloud of regreat after you conquered your fear and did the thing you most dreaded. That's the real hell."
This sums up most of my life. You put it into words much better than i could.
Beautifully written and very (almost chillingly) true. 
This is very astute and correct from my experience. Well-written.
"> The past is regret, the future is dread and so you spin in place, or maybe more appropriately, you spiral.
All of life's a stage, as Shakespeare says, you have stage fright, you're fucking up your lines and everyone's staring.

This is the best way to say it.

""It's too late for this thing"" and ""I don't have the time to do that anyway"".

And then when you lost 2 months you think ""I had the time to do that, I'm a fucking idiot"" and ""this new thing will take way too long"". And then you'll look back and think ""yes you had the time you fucking moron"", etc. And you never do it. Because you'd rather shoot yourself on stage then talk. But shooting yourself means attracting attention and people will still talk about you so you don't. "

"I was am emo teen, and now a decade later I still feel like an emo teen inside but look like a young prudential on the outside..."
"It does sound like an emo teen, but only because this is actually a very common feeling among most people, not just people with extreme social anxiety. It's just more common for younger people with less emotional maturity to vocalize it as if its something that others dont struggle with like they do.  Because it's so common, it's not a very good way to describe living with social anxiety. "
Emo teen spotted
And the irony is they probably do think you are strange or obnoxious because you don't talk about your interests.

Increased heart rate in every social situation 
"This. I consider myself pretty good socially, but the idea of a phone call can render me couch ridden for a couple of hours. Nice one brain."
"As part of my job, I have to call customers when they have a large return that needs to be picked up by a truck, so that I can see if the shipment is ready.  That is the worst.  Half of the time, I have to talk to two or three different people before I get one who knows what I'm talking about.  I always have to take a deep breath before making the phone call.  I don't know how people can work in a call center and do that all day."
"I broke down crying because I had to call my grandma... Nice lady, just too much for me."
"Fucking hell. I like to think I'm great in face to face conversation. Personable, witty, a good listener.

Tell me I have to make a phone call and I'll probably get super nervous, almost break down, and put it off for as long as I possibly can. It's like the last vestige of the social anxiety I've worked so hard to get rid of over the years, it just won't go away."
"I don't have social anxiety, but something about making calls, man. I hate the feeling"
I have social anxiety and work in the tax office and occasionally have to take calls from subcontractors in the construction industry. A good proportion of which are rough sounding and pissed that HMRC is looking into them. Every day of work is me sat there doing case work and living in fear of the phone ringing. 
[deleted]
I’m the opposite. Having to meet somebody in person makes my heart rate skyrocket but phone calls are easy
"Or when you're leaning back in a chair, but accidentally lean just a bit too far, but constantly."
Accurate.
The most accurate description of the feeling I've heard
"I described it to my therapist as that feeling you get when you think you're about to get hit by a car, everytime i make a mistake or think i said something dumb."
"Wow, never knew how to describe the feeling before. "
"Holy shit this is so accurate.
"
"oh, yup, this is it."
Oof. Hurts
">it’s the inability to look a person in the eye when talking to them.

Well fuck now I'm crying. I can never seem to be able to have eye contact with anyone I'm talking to for over a second. I have to constantly keep looking away which makes me start to feel like they'll think I'm being rude and I'm not interested in what they're saying. So I start panicking and find it even harder to look at them. It's worse with teachers because when you have a question and they're explaining something to you, constantly having to look away is weird AF. Sometimes I'll try so hard to maintain eye contact but then have a panic attack because I don't know whether to look at their right eye or left or the middle of  their eyebrows and I end up darting my eyes back and forth so it looks like I'm having a fucking seizure."
It's sending a message to a friend who you've had numerous good conversations with and they read it but don't respond to you and you suddenly feel like they don't like you and you somehow ruined your friendship.
This is it.  I also can’t even bring myself to play social VR games.  
Me irl
"I have a pretty easy time telling jokes but it's become more of a security blanket. Goofing around with people is easy but actually talking to them in an earnest way where I'm not trying to throw a punchline in the end is really hard for me. 

When I talk to people, I focus on their hair or their general face because when I actually look them in the eye, I can feel my eyes start to tear up and I don't even know why. I have to squint a bit and dart my eyes around when talking because of that.

I'm really outgoing, too. I love talking to people but for some reason I'm always afraid that I'll build a good relationship with someone and they'll just take a good look at me for a solid minute and then start to think that I'm horrible."
Nice 
.
"That last point, about the analyzing conversations, really strikes home...

It fuckin sucks so bad.

Good luck! I'm assuming you're still in high school; and as a recent graduate, it does get better!"
"I hear ya. It only goes away with practice. To force yourself to practice you need a plan. A plan that gradually provides you with greater challenges, step-by-step. To put together a plan, you need a therapist, one who gets it, and will hold you to the plan. Klonopin, xanax, and beta blockers helps a ton with the initial challenge, but should not be relied on for long."
"I have heard that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is one of the best ways to handle it. I am still trying to find a counselor that will fit me into their schedule.

Statistically speaking, it is one of the best ways to address panic attacks/social anxiety."

"The uncontrollable hand shaking happens to me a lot. What's super annoying is when it comes up in situations where I have to show someone something on a computer and my mind is perfectly clear but my hand suddenly forgets how to use a mouse. 

I remember getting help registering for classes at my school one time but because my counselor was right next to me, I had a really hard time aiming the mouse and I kept quietly saying ""c'mon already"" to myself."
"Social anxiety can easily lead into depression because you are too scared to interact with people, yet too lonely to be happy..."
Where on your body do you get tingles? Is it like aa pins and needles feeling? Also what is it about mmos that make you nervous? 
As a child I think I had a stomach ulcer from the anxiety or at least it felt like that. Feel for you man. 
Oh god job interviews. I’m fortunate that I have a good job that I like with a good company because I don’t think I can psych myself up to interview ever ever again. 
That's pretty accurate to how I am too. 
"Oh god, this. Or when you’re really hungry but you’re terrified of people thinking you’re a pig so you get JUST an apple. Everyone else has gotten yogurt, donuts, coffee, juice. But you just have an apple, and keep thinking about everything else you want to eat but CAN’T. "
"I've actually been in that situation during a graduation party. Also adding in that you're really self-conscious about the way you eat and strain to do it as politely and secretly as possible and make absolutely no stains.

It takes you twice as long to finish food in a social setting as you normally would and you know you're still a bit hungry but you're worried about looking like a glutton and eating everyone's food (even though there is plenty more and that food is for you) so you stop eating until you can make it back home and raid your fridge."
"That second paragraph may or may not have just given me intense flashbacks. God, I don’t miss that. "
thank god I'll never have to choose a group again 
I have never had a better analogy for what I have than this.
"I did that too, except, my panic came from the fact that I had only been trained as a cook for about 3 days and even though everything on the menu was unbelievably simple (burgers and breakfast), and I've been cooking at home since I was as in 5th grade, I was so convinced that I just couldn't do it right in a work situation, so I called in sick and then I felt EXTRA SHITTY because my manager had to pull a double because there wasn't anyone else to come in

Plot twist: I worked there for 3 years as a server, and eventually wormed my way back into the kitchen - mostly because I worked with a lot of smokers, and inevitably, a customer would come in and want food as soon as the cook went out on a cigarette break, and I was too awkward and anxious to go get the cook, so I just did it myself so I didn't have to bother anyone to do it for me"
"have found a small smile and downward nod works well for the whole acknowledge then move on bit of things. most peeps either respond in kind or look confused while attempting to place you

edit: I meant in the context of having already made eye contact with a stranger. the step up from that is actively searching out eye contact and desensitising yourself to it. if that’s too scary, start with a list of scary things and rank them from least scary to scariest and imagine them first (starting from the least scary ones) and when you’re more comfortable with imagining them, try them in real life. rinse and repeat until you’re more functional in social situations "
But their lives are based on judging me. It's a national sport. They always nominate me for worst person award to see if I win

"Damn feel like this one is me, i have a pretty good job and a mostly stress free life. But i went to shitty schools where i got bullied and then a rich preppy high school where i had nothing in common with people and few friends.  

Led to me having awful self esteem until late in college when i started working out a lot and then at work dealing with patients. 

Still my entire social life was and is online. My anxiety hits basically only physically, im fully aware of its irrationality, yet cant control the sweating,shakiness,awkward movement, churning stomach.

And yeah the worst part is the brief moments where you can somehow escape, even just a minute or two of being a normal person before being dragged back into the void."
Link me if you get any please
This is how it is for me! Everyone is describing mental taxes but the physical taxes for me is what really makes me realize and appreciate my social anxiety exists. 
Well dayum lol
"I am/was him. Ideally he would get therapy. 

I hate to say it but what helps me at a party is when my SO stays by my side kind of like a shield (sad I know). especially at the beginning 

Also I think I would have gone out more if my SO expressed a strong desire to experience things with me, versus the desire to do things with other people+ me

I feel so worthless most of the time, some partner worship is really helpful too."
Because some people aren’t aware of what that feels like. 
"I've gotten better with phone calls. As long as I know there is a script to an interaction, my anxiety isn't too bad. But if I don't have a good idea of what the other person is going to say, that spikes my anxiety back up again. I think a lot of my anxiety is rooted in uncertainty. I hate not knowing how to react to people, that people will try to catch me off guard with something. There are no good surprises, you know?

"
We're both the same. I could barely make eye contact when i talk to anyone. Especially girls.
"I hate walking out of a shop when I haven't bought anything, because I'm convinced they must think I'm a shoplifter"
"Also I can’t help but have my eyes go wide when I’m walking in public, and people definitely notice. I also walk really fast so I look scared(I mean I kinda am lol) reason I know my expression is noticeable is because I used to work in a big retail store and my coworkers would point it out ...yay more to worry about in public!"
"Today was this one for me. I heard the yelling and commotion of someone else a few aisles over being accused. I haven't even touched anything and it was very obviously not directed at me, but I had such an internal freakout. I stood there staring at the candles for ages till I calmed down enough to get on with it."
Literally this. For me I end up looking suspicious because I can't keep still and focused I have to always keep moving. I'm also hyperaware of others so I also try not to be in others way.
"I also get that feeling when walking around stores, it fucking sucks "
I only just realized that this probably isn’t normal behaviour
Is it possible to have this only some of the time?
And anyone you hear laughing you instantly feel that their laughing at you but you've got not idea why so you start questioning everything you're either doing or have just done.
"You need to start shoplifting, or just pretend you are."
Not to mention overanalying what the other person said or did trying to figure out if they were annoyed by you. Shit sucks
"Omg me as well! I actually lost weight my first year of college cause I was too anxious to eat normally in the dining halls, I thought everyone would judge me for eating too much or the way I ate"
"Jimmy Christmas! I am not allowed to look at my husband during dinner. It's just us and our two pets. And by allowed I mean that it makes him uncomfortable, not that I get punished or anything, lol. It makes HIM more nervous or upset. "
I thought I was alone in this!!!  I've been that way for as long as I remember.  Probably tied into my ED as well but eating around people I don't know is... nope!
"That part about the script is perfect. It’s like conversations are just scenes where you know what you need to say and hopefully the other person just keeps it superficial and predictable so nothing gets crazy.
I have a certain personality for each person I know I’m going to interact with throughout the day, and it’s so jarring when something goes differently than what I expect. Like if I say something, and they don’t respond the way I thought they would, it starts a spiral where I try to grasp at anything that they may respond positively to, and just typing this out seems insane. Oops."
"That’s a difficult question, and the answer will vary from person to person. I haven’t been to therapy in years, so I’m in no position to give advice, but that’s the place to start. Mine stems from poor self esteem and a low sense of self. I base my self esteem off of what other people think of me. I don’t feel accomplished unless someone else acknowledges it. I can’t have an opinion unless someone else validates it. 

I rarely go out with someone who isn’t a very close friend, or my boyfriend. When I start to feel uncomfortable, what seems to help is the person just not really acknowledging my fear, if that makes sense. They just go along with our outing and offer distractions by looking at things or talking to me about their life. I hate it when people constantly ask “are you okay?” or “what’s wrong?” Because that just feeds into it almost. Sorry for all that, but it’s really hard to explain. If he’s having problems, I’d recommend seeing a professional."
"I like this comment. I do see it as a form of narcissism, but at the same time, I don’t ever think that people are looking at me because they think I’m important. I don’t think I’m important. I think people are looking because they see me as something less than them. Someone ugly and worth making fun of. 

But it is worth noting the narcissistic thought that can be behind thoughts like this. Assuming people are going to take so much time to think about what you’re doing is silly. And I acknowledge that, but it’s hard to dismiss it as that in the moment. I want to explore this more though. I haven’t been in therapy in years and it’s getting to a point where living like this is unbearable, so I’d like to try that out again.

The last time I was in therapy was when I was in rehab almost 8 years ago, so congratulations on sobriety. That’s something that is difficult enough to overcome on its own."
"Its narcissism. To think everyone around you is always thinking about you/concerned what you are doing/judging you. 

The best thing you can do (or at least i do) is reminding myself I am not that important. That 99% of the people i think are thinking about me literally dont even notice I exist. "
"Social anxiety is usually (or, at least, in my particular case) very closely tied with matters of low confidence/low self-esteem/mild depression. 

By definition, a person with low self-esteem places very little to no actual value in themselves (speaking from experience). In our mind, we're absolutely worthless.

So, the only way we can find anything of value in ourselves is when *other people* point it out. Therefore, outside opinions become not just an important thing, they become *the most important* thing, because they're the only ones we'll take seriously.

Again, I'm only speaking from my own personal experience, so I may be waaaaay off here in regards to other people, but that's basically what it was/kind-of-still-is like for me: my own opinion of myself is already complete shit, so outside opinion becomes all-important because that's the only way I can get some sort of compliment or validation that my brain might actually take seriously."
Hey I'm procrastinating like that right now
"To add to this, for me, I love being social. I go out, have a good time, crack jokes, and can be the life of the party. Then I get home, and that’s when the anxiety kicks in. Maybe later that evening when I’m laying in bed, or perhaps the next morning 
when I wake up. I start to think about all the things I said “did I make a fool of myself, did I offend someone? Oh god remember that one joke that didn’t go so well?!?! I’m going to just sit here and replay that over and over in my head until I die of embarrassment”

I can be awkward in person as well. Usually this happens when I either have not been out in a while or when I run into someone when I am not prepared for social interaction. For example, I just ran into a friend in the grocery store yesterday, we’ve hung out a few times but are not very close. The entire time I was standing there, holding a half filled container of olives, feeling like an awkward piece of shit. 

"
"This seems fairly accurate for extroverts with social anxiety, but not for describing social anxiety generally. Everyone experiences it differently."
Well social anxiety generally leads to having poor social skills. That’s the worst part to me. It’s a never ending cycle. I can’t get better at socializing because it terrifies me then I think about how far behind I must be compared to everyone else because of it and that just makes me feel worse.
[deleted]
"Oh fuck off, just because you don't experience some of the other things people do doesn't mean it's their social skills that are the issue"
"Yeah, just give me a bit of whiskey and I‘ve been confirmed to be a very open and cool person. But without it, I‘m always thinking too much about what to say."
"And then someone tells you to get over it or try harder, which destroys what little self esteem you have cause it helps prove  the feelings you have about being a useless piece of shit"
"Ha, if alcohol helped my social anxiety I'd happily become an alcoholic, but all it does is make me talk openly about my trauma with literally anybody in the vicinity. 

People don't want to drink with the guy who only talks about trauma when he drinks."
"you dont have to get drunk you just have to get a little tipsy.

Source: 3 shots of vodka has helped me"
"> And then the fact that for a lot of people getting drunk is like an instant cure for social anxiety which leads to alcoholism since some people will happily choose that over constant loneliness and emptiness.

When people ask why I don't drink, I always just wave it off as me not being much of a drinker, but this is the real reason.  There is a lot of alcoholism among people with social anxiety as they depend on it more and more to get through social interactions.  Even though  I can control myself the few times I do drink, it's just not something I want to risk.  Alcoholism runs in my family as it is, so I've seen how ugly it can be, and not a road I want to go down.  I don't want to fix one problem by replacing it with another."
Basically what ive been doing for the last two weeks 
"The thing is, even without people telling me that, I thought about using alcohol to blend out my brain reminding me of the things that happened all the time, possibly for good. I still have not ruled that out. And drinking alcohol could fix my stress eating problems as well."
"this is why I quit drinking kinda, I dont wanna depend on alcohol to be a more fun person, and so far it's working pretty well. I feel like when I'm sober around drunk people I still feel more comfortable and their drunkenness is very infectious so I still have a good time.

I also stopped because I got huge emotional hangovers. 

If you have the problem the guy I'm responding to is talking about I recommend quitting. It's hard but it gets better"
"> You know what's really messed up, when you don't think that and it turns out someone actually does dislike you. 

This is the worst. You think for one minute to let your guard down, not everyone could possibly dislike you. And then you're given a reason to hide back within your shell."
A paranoid asshole removed themself from your life? Sounds like you got the better end of that deal.
"Yes! I recently had someone who fucking *hounded* me for weeks for doing something mildly rude. Like, you spend years trying to convince yourself that it's okay, people don't care that much, you're allowed to make mistakes...and then here comes an asshole. Back to square one."
"When I was about 14, at a friends birthday party there were some other girls in my year who I didn't really know. Because of this, I wasn't talking all that much (because in situations like that I have absolutely nothing to say, literally an empty brain). After a few hours they asked me why I wasn't talking, then told me to say something. Me being me had no idea what to say, panicked and went with a weird ""hello"", to which I received strange looks
 
Mortified, I made my excuses to go home not long after. 

I'm now nearly 22, and it still makes me cringe"
"> The worst is when someone says ""Why don't you talk more?"" because then I'm even more aware of my anxiety and don't know how to respond.

I hate when people say this and things like ""You're so quiet.""  I'm fully aware of this, thanks.  You need to give me some time to get comfortable enough around you to not feel self-conscious every time I say something to you."
"Or if you do have a good interaction with a new acquaintance, you think, ""Once they get to know me, they will hate me."""
"Oh wow. Me too on the secret hate thing. I have very bad anxiety and am trying to be friends with someone who I think is both very busy, and on the aspie spectrum. It is probably the hardest social thing I've ever done. I'm getting absolutely minimal cues from them, and half my head is constantly screaming ""you are a pest, they actually don't like you but have no idea how to tell you."""

I make it a point of simply flat-out ignoring sweating, blushing, stimming, stammering, stuttering, etc. If someone has had to gear up to talk to me, and is making a level effort to do so in spite of all that, in 98% of cases it is worth my time to ignore their highly visible social anxeity and take the extra time to get through that convo with them. It's what I'd want someone to do for me. 15 extra minutes isn't going to kill me."
"I've had that for days now. Was pursued by this guy, and figured ok he must really like me even though I'm a complete and total loser. Started hanging out, it was fun.

Didn't even let myself text him more than once during those two days. Have had that feeling in my stomach ever since trying to figure out what I did that was so horrible. "

"I got some interesting perspective today talking to someone without social anxiety.

We were talking about weight lifting, and I decided to be honest and explain how I get really bad social anxiety and can't bring myself to get near them. I just know that my anxiety is going to make me dumb and fumble with the machines and weights. 

He told me, ""You're going to look dumb. I do all the time. I google how to use machines as I'm using them. I also get paranoid about using equipment for too long. Sometimes I try new lifts and drop the bar on myself. I'm always accidentally dropping weights. Everything is going to feel awkward until you've done it a few times.""

It doesn't help me that much to hear about his lack of social anxiety, but it's just interesting how he's fully aware he makes a fool out of himself and just *doesn't care*. I need to learn how to do that. "

"I instantly get way more relaxed when I realize there is a dog wherever I'm going. When I had to go meet with my landlord to get my first ever apartment I remember being extremely nervous, but as I was waiting in a chair this large black lab runs out from the back and starts showering me with love. Nervousness went away right then. "

"Not saying this will happen to you but this exact scenario lead to alcoholism which turned into heroin addiction at some point which led to being homeless which led to me typing this out from my room at a rehab at the age of 34. 15 months clean right now but obviously I wish that at 18 I'd have gotten the help, even in pill form, so that I never had the life experience to type out this comment.

My life wasn't all bad whatsoever, and it didn't happen overnight, but it all started with not recognizing that I had an issue. A few beers turns into half a bottle of jagermeister real fuckin quick, that's all I'm saying"
That's an incredibly dangerous method of self medication.  
"I have gone to therapy for a long time.  What helps best is Xanax.  It only lasts two hours, you only take it when you need it.  Also think of other stuff.  Think of two or three word phrases to describe details of the environment--long mirror, oak desk, straw hat, folded bath towels."

"I replay conversations in my head all of the time.  Or, sometimes, I'll have conversations in my head about things I want to say to somebody.  I usually fall asleep pretty easily, though.  

My mom committed suicide when I was a teenager and I'm pretty sure she suffered from social anxiety as well.  I'd often see her daydreaming/moving her lips like she was having a conversation with somebody.  I think most of the time it was about work, as I usually saw her doing this in the evening after she got home.  She had a boyfriend, but other than that, she only had a couple of friends from work that she really hung out with and they didn't go out that often."

Yeah it's so hard!
Worse still is thinking what they'll be saying about you behind your back.

I have the same thoughts and hearing you share your perspective has made me more comfortable with myself. Thank you.
"Exactly why I like reddit. Nobody knows who I am so fuck them if they're judging, because it can't affect any part of my life other than my reddit life. If they start finding my other posts to find weird things, easy, just make a new profile, can't actually ruin my life too much. "
Haha that's being a good friend. I always take things personally when my friend bail or something similar to that. Shits toxic
"I too have a hard time eating around other people. I dont have an eating disorder, i eat more than enough calories for my weight, but there is just something unnerving about eating around tons of people."
"This was me everyday at school. (moreso elementary school but still after) I would never know where to look when eating. At the food? Around the room? Randomly at classmates and their food? My friend? My crush? And if I was sitting with a friend I guess I'm supposed to look at them but maybe I look weird when looking at them? Maybe they don't want me staring at them?

Man why is social interaction so hard"
"I have somewhat severe social anxiety and I need to psych myself up for every single social interaction that's not with family or very close friends.

Everything else provokes some kind of response from my anxiety.

Why don't you think it sounds right?"
It varies from person to person. I do indeed get some form of anxiety when making simple chit chat with the barista I see every weekday.

"I was there but I got better - Toward the end of university, I had social anxiety bad enough that leaving the house had me drenched in stress sweat.  It affected me on a psychosomatic level - my stomach regularly (just about daily) twisting itself into knots to the point where I was actually ill.

Over the winter holidays I told my dad that I couldn't see myself continuing with school (I was done third year and facing my fourth) and while he was disappointed he did want the best for me- I couldn't figure out what I'd end up doing, and as part of that long, hard conversation, he asked me what I'd do if I could get paid for doing anything.  And that thing for me was writing.  I'd never taken it seriously because to be a writer who lives off of their writing is a million to one thing.

But, you know, I had one project on the go online that was getting good reviews, so I decided to take it seriously.  Upped the amount I asked of myself for chapter minimum wordcounts, gave the writing a lot more thought, responded to audiences asking if they could throw me a few dollars by putting up a 'support the author' paypal button and promised a bonus chapter for every $75 total I got.

I wrote a (stressing: unpolished, first-draft) book a month while working 0-30 hours a week with a family friend who prepped houses for sale.  I could paint, landscape, install drywall and think about what I was going to write next while I did it, while earning some money that let me stretch my savings further.  It was a pretty spartan existence, rice and beans, weeks where I worked saw me working, writing, eating, and sleeping, with maybe 20-30 minutes a day allotted to play some Binding of Isaac.  Weeks I didn't work were less intense but saw me stressing about the future.  I'd started the writing in mid-2011, made the leap to quit school at the start of 2012, and I became a full time writer in 2014.  I made a bit over minimum wage at that point and I was as happy as a pig in mud. 

The anxiety got a ton better just from the act of exiting the mire I was in with school.  There were parts that got worse - I had people close to me who were super upset or judgmental that after floundering through university for far too long, I didn't have a four year degree.  After the writing came up, I had family members tell me that I didn't deserve to get lucky with the writing after screwing around so much with University, and that they hoped I'd fail and get 'back on course' with life.  But as part of the attempt to distance myself from the anxiety, I moved to another town (where rent was cheap) and put some distance between myself and those people.  That helped a *lot*.

But the thing about social anxiety as I experienced it and wrote it above, is that it's a spiral.  If you can get out of the whirlpool, finding an anchor, a kernel of self worth, an identity or a direction, things get so much better.  I had a label I could apply to myself, and I think like anyone who goes vegan or does crossfit, finds keto or otherwise finds a lifestyle that gives them identity, direction, and a sense of self improvement, I was probably a bit obnoxious and awkward in the initial stages of ""Oh shit, I actually have worth as a person now!"".  But that's still leaps and bounds better than being miserable, near-silent, and still being obnoxious and awkward because of being thoroughly in the mire of anxiety.  And I've improved some since then.

There's no suffering now.  Life is good, I can see more of the world around me, the perspective of that world doesn't feel so skewed."
that's acne

"Increased heart rate when walking down the street and you see someone walking towards you in the distance on your side. Will they cross over? Should I cross over? No that would look weird, like I'm up to no good. What if they look at me or speak to me? Maybe I should turn around?

Then you end up focused completely on something in the distance if you decide to walk past them, refusing to look at them. Concentrating on walking normally etc. "
"My wife *still* doesn't understand this. I get SO anxious when I have to make a phone call - I always have to step out of the room and go to a place where no one can hear me.

"friend and i read The Game by neil strauss.  both of us single, thinking, ""we should get better at being social,"" my buddy picked up his get a date in 30 days self help shit and we started going through it day by day.

he was acing it, but he's always been very outgoing, huge extrovert, chatting with cashiers, making shitty jokes.  i'm good at conversation once it's been started, i know the hoops, but i'm an introvert who doesnt' really start conversations unless iv'e been drinking.

all the ""activities"" or ""tests"" where we're supposed to randomly ask a stranger for advice, or make small talk, he's acing, and i'm crashing at.  but then we hit this one test where you have to dial a random number from a phonebook and play it off as a wrong number, but ask for a movie recommendation ""while you got them on the phone, anyway.""  and i did really well.  when it's just voices, it was So much more comfortable.  i have no idea if the person i'm talking to is attractive or weirdlookin.  JUST LIKE THE INTERNET :D  but he fell apart.  he'd stammer, sound like he was saying scripted shit.  he couldn't get anyone to talk to him for more than 10 seconds without hanging up on him.

s'weird."

"Well most people would recommend therapy and medication but because of my anxiety there was no way I was going to see a therapist. What helped for me in 2016 I forced myself to have a garage sale because I needed the money to pay property taxes and I kept telling myself that having to move would be worse than the garage sale. At first my anxiety acted up but as I spent all weekend in my driveway dealing with customers and nothing had happened, I'd even go as far as I even enjoyed talking to a couple people I meant the anxiety faded and I had no problem going in my front yard after that.

Then a couple months later Pokemon go came out and I wanted to play that so bad that I went to the park. There was literally hundreds of people there playing. At first I was scared but everyone was so incredibly nice and would ask me what Pokemon I had caught and whatnot. I had so much fun that first month or so of the game I would go to the park and play it every single day. That really helped a lot. Today my anxiety is still there a little bit but it's at a manageable level now where I can actually function and go places. I just got my GED like 3 weeks ago and am looking for a job now. My anxiety is starting to act up a little when I think about working but I'm hoping like my garage sale and Pokemon go that after I try it it won't be so bad."
Yeah I was in tears after 2 hrs... we laughed about it later once we became friends
"Sorry I'm just answering...I literally fell off the map for awhile. My body starts to tingle on my hands first, and spreads up my arms, to my neck, and then my face. It's more like a numb, pins and needles feeling. It's hard to describe because it feels kinda like when your foot falls asleep. And idk why, but MMOs make me so be nervous mainly because people can be so mean. Same with social media. Sometimes I get so anxious after reading someone being awful on anything. I think it's because I hate conflict. "
"It sucks. But you always have to remember that the way you are thinking in this regard is wrong. Nobody cares if you do something stupid, nobody thinks about strangers. And Even if a stranger thinks you are weird, why should you care? Its hard to get out of the anxiety mindset but its not impossible"
I spent all my mental energy rehearsing it in my mind
"Thanks for your response.  I really appreciate it.  It’s hard for me to by sympathetic sometimes because my husband is so amazing and he’s just feels anything but, and I can never understand WHY! He’s so intelligent, can carry an awesome conversation, and is really good looking to boot.  To me he’s awesome and a great addition to any social gathering, but he gets so nervous and stressed out especially when we are on our way there— which eventually pushes us into a little spat. 

He has gained some weight over the years so I have noticed that his insecurities have risen because of this.  Therapy is not an option for him right now.  He has been pretty adamant against it for some time and that’s also been another thorn in our relationship’s side.  Specifically because he has been in therapy before and it worked so I don’t understand why he can’t just try it again! But I know he’ll go when he really, really needs to.  So I’m just trying my hardest to be empathetic and compassionate towards him until then.  

I’m sorry you experience this too.  It really must be like torture to feel so alone in a room full of people. I’m so awkward myself and make some pretty weird jokes but I have no problem laughing at myself and have self deprecation.... so I can just roll with the punches and not get too caught up in what others think of me.  I just know overall I’m a really nice girl who is friendly to everyone so I just don’t stress about it.  

I wish I could help you all but I just want to specifically thank you for helping me understand how I can try to help in the best way possible.  Please let me know if you have any other suggestions.

And on a personal note, life is meant to have fun.  Without putting yourself in uncomfortable positions, you’d never grow and learn.  I hope one day you can not take yourself so seriously and just go out there and have one night of unadulterated fun— you deserve it!"
"Actually the best surprise is when you make a phone call THINKING you’re gonna have to talk to someone, but it ends up being one of those “press this number for this option” calls and none of them lead to real people 😃"
I use to hate this too until I worked in a shop and saw people walk out with nothing all the time and I thought absolutely nothing of it.
"last night i walked to a store, the moment i was in the front door i knew i saw what i wanted in another store, went there and faked checking for products, i talked to 2 employees asking random questions and left. .... i'm 24 living alone been so since 17, having a major role in a pretty big company, having said that i can't believe how fucked social anxiety is :( ... i can make decisions and come up with ideas worth or risk thousands of dollars, yet i can't walk away from a store cuz the thing i'm looking is not there. fuck.  "
This. I feel this way sometimes. It’s awkward.
"If you haven't actually stolen anything, I don't really see what the problem is."
"Yeah it's really not the ""thinking you're so important"" part it's really just the thinking that people are constantly thinking about you. Positive or negative. Like just think about today and how many people you probably passed. If you are anything like me you probably thought everyone is noticing you and judging you ect ect. How many of those people you passed do you even remember? How many were you thinking about? How many could you have cared less anything about them. 

The narcissism is just believing all the people around you who you dont know even know you exist/notice you. Odds are they dont. It's very illogical and can be very hindering to your life. 

Thinking about it as a form of narcissism helps me to get rid of it. 

And thanks man. Almost 4 years clean and sober from a nasty heroin addiction. Haven't had a drink or a drug since. Got married and have my first kid on the way due in March. The sober life is good. Better than I ever thought was possible for me when I was out there. I hope you're doing well yourself with it. If not, dont give up trying. It's worth it."
"How can you think you are less than any other human being I’m confused where the disconnect is? You’re looking to another being who is exactly like you for acceptance when the only being who can give it to you, is you. Everyone in the world could compliment you and it still wouldn’t change the fact you still need to say I like me for me not because anyone else has to agree with what I’m doing or how I do it. Fuck em. "
So relatable..
"I fuck up jokes so bad with my two pretty co-workers that at this point they look forward to it. And even though it would be nice to not be shit at jokes sometimes, I enjoy the fact that they find it so humorous. Sometimes I freak about it but usually I can enjoy the weird situation."

That's true!
"Same, I use it all up and then I get heart palpitations if I think about leaving the house."
That’s because they described being an introvert not having social anxiety. 
That's true!

I've got a really good zone after a few drinks where I'm the coolest guy in the room. It's unfortunate because the zone is very small and on oneside I'm a boring shy guy and on the other I'm a raging obnoxious asshole. Very rarely can I quit when I'm in the sweet spot. 
"I'm the kind of person who would happily talk to others about their trauma if we were drinking. I like having deeper, more emotional conversations that I don't normally get to have."
All it takes for my anxiety to go away is 1 shot. It's insane how easy it is and it also makes it really hard not to revert to alcohol when I know how easy it is. Many times before work I'd take a shot so I could go in feeling talkative and full of life. 
"Yeah, I know I act somewhat flat but I do make sure to not be negative and try to be helpful. 

The absolute one thing I can't stand is me being a burden to a group so in games on the very rare situation that I'm doing significantly worse than anyone else I'll offer to leave. So on the flipside of that I make damn sure I don't say anything to make anyone else feel like that. So when failing something I'll try to be the first to say stuff like ""We came close"" or ""I think we have this, just got to try a tiny bit harder.""

Then I go and get accused of being socially challenged (fair but does that really matter) and negative (not fair, I'm only negative on one subject, Destiny's crucible mode, and my statements either gets laughs or agreement)."
Don't forget that having somebody dislike you doesn't even really matter but for whatever reason we decide it's fucking life altering and that it means that everybody else hates you too.
I really came out of my shell freshmen year of college and then I started getting harassed by men on campus. I also got my heart broken. Needless to say I am even further down in my shell now 
"That's the weird thing. Only ""asshole"" thing he did was right then. Played games with him online since... well whenever Peace Walker came out on Xbox 360 (so 8ish years)."
"Something that helped me with cringing at things that happened a decade ago is trying to remember really cringey things other people did. Does it leave a lasting impression on you? Chances are, you don't care at all. Thats what happens when other people think of your cringey moments.

And further, people almost never remember what you say or do. People remember how you make them feel. Thats why ""having confidence"" and ""accepting yourself"" gets you so far in social interactions. I used quotation marks because if you are chronically anxious, these are just phrases you hear and don't know how to execute. A good interpretation is ""Stop having compulsively anxious thoughts"". 

Stopping completely is impossible - for everyone. But stopping in the moment is also possible for everyone (in MOST situations). Thinking in your head ""These thoughts I am having are anxiety. I am going to think about (insert what you want to be focused on here) instead"" when you are caught up in it does wonders through repetition. It is extremely hard, but it is simple and it helps.

Sorry, I began writing advice for you/ others, but ended up writing for myself. Good luck!"
How can you even sleep at night? haha do't worry no one will remember that..
"Yes! Or even like I’ll meet a new group of people, have a good time, but then I’ll be too nervous at ask them to hang out again, and so I casually avoid them, which makes them think I didn’t like them and so we never hang out again. :("
"If I may, I used to have a lot of social anxiety back in school. My brother was the only reason I had friends in school because he adjusted better to a bad childhood I guess. We were too young to understand it but over the years, being around great outgoing, accepting, friends who I could be open with helped me. Anxiety and social awkwardness doesn't go away overnight. But having worked towards it, I can safely look back and wonder where it went. 

Growing up in India, we have a saying that everyone grows up with, being ""Log kya kahenge"" which translates to ""What will people say"". It's the bane of society if you ask me. Everyone always looking into each others' plates to see how much the other person has. Being compared to neighbours' kids who scored better in school. Being forced into education you don't feel skilled nor interested in. It was bad. ""Not giving a fuck"" didn't seem like the right thing to do because you definitely should care about  some people and some things, right? But one day I came up with my own philosophy and outlook that worked for me. 

If I'm worried about what someone will think of me I just ask myself, ""When I die, will this person come to see my body?"" 

A little morbid, I know, but when I'm cold and dead, does this person give enough of a shit about me to make the effort to see me one last time before I'm turned into ashes. From then on those are the only people whose opinions mattered to me. It helped immensely. I was more open, more outgoing, dressed how I wanted, grew out my hair, said what I wanted. The first time I realised it changed me was when a rumor spread that I was crushing on this girl in my class (I wasn't, I just thought she was cute). I walked right up to her and said ""Guess what, I have a crush on you, apparently."" She asked ""Apparently?"". And I went ""Yeah I just found out this morning."" She got it and we laughed. It was great. That's when I realised these small things I was worried about that held me back didn't mean anything. 

If I make a fool of myself in front of this person, we won't get to know each other, and that means I can move on and not worry about ""what ifs"". 

Anyway sorry for the wall of text and I hope this helps. Talk to people. You'll realise a lot of them have problems of their own. Help them with theirs and they'll help you with yours. Don't miss things. Show the fuck up and make a fool of yourself. We live to make memories. Someday that's all we'll be anyway."
"There were girls I crushed on in high school that I never asked out, and 20 years later it hasn't haunted me at all. Nothing in high school matters.

There are millions of girls out there you can ask out once you're ready to do so. No reason to do it before then. It's not going to haunt you, that's ridiculous. "

"On the offchance that you are a friend of mine who is in the same situation, we certainly do judge you, but also understand why you dropped out. We really just want you to feel better as we care about you."
Really hard to get over the fear of missing out too. I'm not even in my 20's yet but I feel like I'm running out of time. Worst part of anxiety is that you know you're being irrational. Sucks
"I appreciate that, it does help but i want to actually enjoy myself when im there and i cant entirely if holding myself back with this anxiety crap"
"I am happy for you. Just to notice, I am not an alchololic, I drink few beers monthly. "
"this is how I became an alcoholic. I have the exact same problem as OP. I could go out and get wasted and have a good old time without anxiety, and it became habitual. I drank almost every night throughout my twenties.

"So wait, you arent on any medication or anything?

I have had really bad anxiety for about 3~4 years and i have been on medication which has helped a lot. For you, was it just increasing your social interactions?"
"Thank you for your thoughts. Fortunately I have done some therapy recently and things are improving but anxiety is not rational and hard to extinguish. What seems simple and natural to others might seem like holding a rattle snake to me. This makes it hard for people in your shoes as attempts to minimize my anxiety (unless I have come to terms with it's irrational, harmful nature) typically just made me angry.

 One other tip I would give is: don't set up social situations with too many challenges eg many unknown people or unknown time frames  Stick to small things eg meet known friends for coffee, go on a hike (no need to interact with company). Try to repeat successful events.

I noticed that the more successful I became the more my social anxiety got worse. Now I strive to be a little better than average (of course I am probably way better than average in some things and way worse on others). Also, I noticed I could use work as an excuse to not socialize with my family.

I also now tell myself that I am not looking to partake only in activities that I expect to be enjoyable, I need to try random things as I can't predict what will happen. It is kind of like investing by dollar cost averaging, my prior nature is to try and time the  market (meaning be very selective about where I go to minimize the risk of embarrament) 

I missed out on a lot when I was in the thick of it, but I had no idea how irrational my thinking had become.

But having said all that, at some point he has to deal with it (such as someone with the disease of addiction) or it will end up limiting your enjoyment. I wish you and him the best."
"LOL...sometimes that actually makes me angry because I was all prepared to speak to a real person, and now I have to navigate their damn phone tree. You threw off my vibe, technology!

The best option for me is when they say ""you can do that online"" or there is a live chat option so I don't have to feel like a dumb-dumb trying to use the phonetic alphabet to spell something over the phone. 

"
Haha exactly the same here. Meetings with big clients and vendors are easy because I'm knowledgeable and know they don't care about me on a personal level and I don't need to make small talk. Similarly pitching ideas and projects to my boss is easy because the conversation is very focused. It's when I have to make small talk conversation about whatever that I fall apart.

"Everything you’re saying is oddly comforting and I’m going to try to think about that more in day to day interactions. It really makes a lot of sense, so thank you.

"Think of it as fight or flight mechanism. Many people with SA avoid social situations. Some people however ""put on a mask"" and become a level 5000 Social Wizard.

At work, with friends, etc I always put on a show and make people laugh and lead a team of 35 workers and give presentations (with preparation, not without notice). But on the other hand I constantly cancel plans with friends, avoid people in the hallways, and just got off a three week personal leave from work because I just couldnt see people from work.

People handle this differently. It doesn't make it any less crushing."
"Just because you can be outwardly “fun” and social doesn’t mean you can’t have social anxiety. Like I said my anxiety comes after the interaction not during, usually. I worry all the time about how I’ve interacted with people. It’s pretty much non stop. It causes me to stop going out and socializing for periods of time because I just can’t deal with it anymore. Then after a while I recharge and head back out and the cycle starts anew. 

I can wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat completely panicked about something I said to someone. What will happen? What will the repercussions be? I can play out ever negative scenario in my head over and over and over. Like it’s the end of the goddamn world cause maybe I said something that could have offended someone. Nothing ever comes of it, but that doesn’t stop it happening over and over. "
Your comment is exactly what is annoying about the imagge of social anxiety. Quite frankly - you couldn't be more wrong. Social anxiety does not have a direct correlation to social skills or enjoyment of social activity at all.
"And the really fun part here, is that if you drink too much, it’ll just make your anxiety worse!"
Not alcohol.  You end up with a lifelong struggle with alcoholism and still have social anxiety.  Except the anxiety is worse and eventually the alcohol won't help the anxiety because you know you're a drunk and you don't want to make a drunken ass out of yourself so you drink alone at home with only your anxiety for company.
fucking lightweight. /s
"Here's another one I'll never let go, which happened when I was about 15/16. I had a coat in the dry cleaners (my mum had put it in), and it was ready to be picked up. My mum gave me the receipt to hold, then made me go to collect my coat. I had no idea what to do or say, and was panicking, so dropped the receipt on the counter instead of handing it to the woman who worked there, who then gave me a horrid look. My mum took over, and I cried.

Around this time I was also having trouble talking to waiters in cafes etc, wouldn't ask for the bill if I was asked to. Thankfully with a bit of practice I'm now able to do all these things, even on my own, I'm even able to make a bit of small talk.    
But social anxiety still hits when making friends, talking socially, and presenting, etc.  "
"Thank you, this helps. I want to be a better person, and this perspective really helps."
"I like this a lot. 

In a similar vein, I also have asked myself how often I remember what a person wore, what condition their shoes were in, whether they had a stain on their shirt or if they said something stupid. 

I'm reallllyyyyyyyy not paying attention to that stuff (I'm female), because I'm thinking too much about myself! So it is reasonable to expand the concept to realize nobody is really paying that much attention to my tiny flaws either. 

Helped me loosen up a lot. "

"I would be just fine with that, but he put in way too much effort just for sex, at least in my opinion. We had been spending most of our free time together for weeks. He was texting me practically all day every day. I was even ready to go home after since we both had work in the morning, but he convinced me to stay, and then we just cuddled all night. My anxiety brain keeps repeating the night trying to figure out what I did wrong. My logical side completely agrees with you. "
"If affordable at all seek out therapy for your anxiety (or other alternatives like books/etc).

Anxiety is often downplayed as an issue but it can be crippling (as in your case).  It gets better with time as long as you spend that time putting yourself out there in public.  "

"I dropped out of school and instantly got my GED. I don't regret doing that. Oddly enough, I am now on my way to bring a nurse. It is something you can work past."
I feel you. I remember those days. Just don't rely on booze to cure the anxiety. It ends poorly. I mean you'll have like 10 years of amazing times maybe but not worth it at all. Wish ya luck.
"Thanks, and fair enough. Sorry for the sermon I just really don't want anybody to have to go through what I did. So sometimes I'll overdo it when I see the signs. Take care!"
It's actually probably awakward as fuck because you can't go outside. If you went outside and took the idea of awkwardness out of your vocabulary maybe you could trick yourself? Come on let's do this but you first.
"Sure, there are obviously different levels of substance use and not all will necessarily lead to dependence. But it can lead to abuse, it has led to dependence for so many people, and it's dangerous. Anyway, if there's one thing pretty much all of us are good at, it's justifying our substance use/abuse."
"Yes but he's literally saying he ""had that problem"" until he realized he could just drink a few beers. A few beers will build a tolerance. Shrugging it off is kinda dangerous imo"
"Only one problem; those friends are really not my friends at all.

A good portion of them used to bully me in elementary."
Basically this
Yes
See instead: remain quiet but think of a cool way to confirm after you have the chance to confirm
Yeah I've never been on any medication or saw a therapist ever. When I needed it my anxiety stopped me from going to a Dr. Now that I'm able to see a Dr I don't think I need it anymore.
oh i know 
"I love this; “Level 5000 social wizard” 

I’m a big plan canceller too. It’s all about how I’m feeling that day. Feeling extroverted? “Fuck yeah, let’s do this!” Feeling introverted? “ummm sorry something came up don’t make it tonight” "
"Wouldn't it be better described as ""anxiety"" rather than SOCIAL anxiety, since in-the-moment social interaction doesn't make you anxious? You get anxiety related to social situations, but if you're not anxious-while-social is it really ""social anxiety""?

Not that the label truly matters so long as you're satisfied with it, I suppose. "

"nah alcohol actually voids me of any anxiety.

weed at times worsens it, depends on my mood and the location.

I’m way too serious and responsible as my persona and always when I smoked during work I got really bad psychosis episodes."
"Sex is a lot of effort for guys most of the time lol. You provided entertainment and a goal to chase, he got what he wanted so he quit playing his game. Dating is hard and some people are pieces of shit with no empathy."
I didn't experience any of that going to school in person so online woulda been fine by me lmao
Oh nah i dont enjoy liquor anywhere near enough to use it as a crutch haha ill be alright eventually (i hope)
"Honestly it comes and goes. I went out today and changed my oil. 

But a few months ago my best friend was getting married and I went to the reception, dropped my gift, and walked out. I'd been looking forward to it for months but there were WAYYYYY to many people there. I think it really hurt his feelings but I can't explain this shit to anyone. It feels good knowing I'm not the only one. "
"*Oh God, he's judging me just like I thought he would!*"
PTSAD (post traumatic social anxiety disorder)?
"""You don't have a problem! I HAVE THE PROBLEM!"""
You can hold your own opinions so long as you know they are factually wrong. They’re false. Untrue. 
"But that doesn’t make your version of social anxiety the only one. My issue revolves around social settings. I’m not socially awkward per say (like it sounds you are) but that doesn’t negate my anxiety. I really don’t care what you want to call it, it’s doesn’t change the fact it’s STILL social anxiety."
"Yea, I mostly meant the next day. I always hate myself more than usual the day after I drink too much."
That makes sense. Sucks though. Can we please start requiring guys to wear signs letting us know if they are pieces of shit. It would make life so much easier. 
"Same thought I had. I was a fairly popular and looks up to person at the time and wish somebody had called me out on my shit instead of the ""Oh that's just E3Y, he parties hardno biggy"" reaction that I had. Only one group of girls called me out on my bullshit when I started mixing pills with booze but I just ignored them anyway. Oh well, I wish you the best just throwing warnings at ya so you can be aware of it. I was aware of it and simply ignored it. Hope you don't do the same."
"I feel ya on the comes and goes. It's weird that I can remember specific days where I was a rock star. I feel like those shouldn't stand out. But the thing is, the one thing that those days have in common with each other is I kept the conversation going. Instead of running out of social situations I stuck it out. I wish I could pinpoint what makes me stay though. I never realize until after the fact. I never initiate conversation though, not really, and I sometimes get bored when somebody is talking for more than a few minutes. But if I stick it out it usually leads to a good fuckin day.

Sorry I guess I needed to type some stuff out. Sorry about the wedding, that sucks.

Edit: BTW I feel like you can totally explain it to him. Social anxiety isn't as much of a hidden stigma as it used to be. My friends and some co-workers know I have it and nobody's hung me out to dry because of it."
Yes
"If only. The first boyfriend I ever had played me for an entire month, slept with me, then ghosted me. I wish I had known but some of them hide it so well"
"I mean i wasnt the guy who originally said they use booze to help, thanks for the warning/advice though! I won't haha im in the clear on that end my man, could never be an alcoholic"
"*Shit, he's really judging me, shit, shit, SHIT,* **SHIT**  *leaves*"
"I'm so sorry, that really sucks. I swear, sometimes I just want to swear off men altogether. "
"Oh whoops. I always wondered how people could comment stuff to the wrong redditor. Now I know!

Do we know why it's redditor vs. redditer?"
"And stay out you anxious shit! *Slams door*

Edit; forgive me for my formatting, am on mobile and have never used italics and stuff before "
"I used to be one of these guys and I'm so sorry you both went through this bullshit. I hated myself every time. I know there are guys who will go all in just for one night of sex. For me though I had good intentions most of the time, just eventually this feeling of ""Im a piece of shit and don't deserve this"" would creep in. And being the idiot, or asshole, that I was I would decide that making her think I was an asshole was the best route to take. So I'd break it off in the worst way possible. I thought I was doing them a favor. They'd obviously realize what a shitshow I was and feel better about themselves. I was wrong and probably just making excuses.

Anyway I'm really sorry guys do this. I'm guessing females do it too but I don't have any experience with that happening. Not this specific thing anyway."
Idk but redditor seems more correct
As long as you have learned the error of your ways and no longer do that! I just want a guy that won't treat me like crap. I didn't realize that would be so hard to find. 
It should get better with age. Also probably depends on where you live or at least what type of people you associate with.
"I'm already in my thirties! Wasted my 20s on a manipulative, emotionally abusive asshole that decimated my self worth. The latest asshole was my first attempt at putting myself back out there, after working on me for awhile and finally feeling good about  myself again  Apparently, I attract assholes. "
"If you live in LA I think this is where I get to redeem my past and you get to have a healthy relationship. I can shop for rings tomorrow if you're not busy.

Really though, the thought of people still doing that shit in their 30s is really depressing. Glad you were able to work on your self worth and that you weren't wrecked. Happy for you!

Edit: You can attract assholes just, yknow, please don't make the mistake of mistaking them for anything but"
"I think I need to move to LA.  Wisconsin is too cold in the winter anyway. I believe my ring size is a 7. 

Took me a while to realize I deserved better, but I'm glad I finally came to my senses. Now, I guess I just need to work on realizing when I've encountered an asshole. "
"I went to summer camp in Wisconsin, love that state. Well, Wild Rose specifically. 7 is a great number. Maybe make it a rule to think of 7 reasons why the guy is serious and not an asshole (and vice versa too maybe) before becoming attached. I live in the moment sometimes and so I can tend to overlook things I shouldn't have. But I find that making lists about things okay wait maybe this is terrible advice and dumb sorry! Good luck with men!"
"That is a beautiful area of the state. I'm in Madison, but try to get out of the city whenever I can. 

I love your lists advice. I tend to get too much into my own head about things, then just say screw it and go for it. I think I need to find a happy medium! Thanks for the advice. "
Happy I could help somebody today. Take curr!
I read here years ago that it feels like the feeling when you've tripped walking down a footpath but haven't caught yourself yet. That feeling remains all day. I always related to that idea.
"Butterflies in my stomach. It feels so unbearably uncomfortable sometimes, it just makes me want to double over in agony but I don't because I don't want people to say I'm being overdramatic."
shoulder/neck/back pain. so much tension.
"It manifests itself differently - in the sense of the frequency, duration, and intensity.

Mild ones - my heart flutters a bit, I can't concentrate, I have a hard time catching my breath

Big ones - i feel like the walls are closing in on me.  my heart feels like it's literally going to jump out of my chest.  my body tenses up involuntarily and I have to concentrate on breathing.  my eyesight even goes for a bit......everything becomes blurry and distorted sometimes.  i sometimes feel like i'm having some type of out of body experience where i can hear people talking to me but it's only the their voices that I can hear.  the clenching of the jaw to the point that it's actually painful. the inability to control my trembling body and hands while trying to any menial task.  drinking a cup of coffee?  splatter everywhere.  trying to jot something down?  9/10 i'll forget what i was supposed to be jotting down or i'll go into some type of automatic mode of writing that after the episode subsides, I can't really make sense of what i wrote.

What's worse, is that I can be having a very pleasant day.  No major worries.  They just come and there isn't a god damned thing I can do about them until they eventually subside.

Overall....it feels like shit."
Being tightly wrapped by belts that get tighter and tighter.  A pressure building up in the head that never becomes painful.
"I’ll go first. I never have the stereotypical “panic attack” that you see in tv and movies. Usually it is a feeling of impending doom. It starts with feeling like nothing is going to go right and then I need to make a plan b in case it doesn’t go right right and then a plan c for plan b and etc. 
When this starts I can feel my neck getting stiff and my hands feel tight. I will start fidgeting with my fingers and instinctively I will sort of curl up, hunch over, cross my legs, anything to make myself feel smaller. I never realize I am doing these things.
I’ve dealt with anxiety for as long as I can remember and a few years ago started on medication and have been going to therapy. While it isn’t a “miracle cure” it does hep make things bearable and it gives me tools to recognize when an anxiety attack starts and how to deal with it."
Bubbling diarrhoea.
"It feels like I'm walking around in a dream and I'm doing the best I can to bring myself back to reality while panicking because I feel disconnected, what's worse is when ur self aware and u argue w urself in ur head bout it knowing its just a passing mo.ent but because u worry that moment can stretch I to days or weeks, mo the if u don't get a hang on it."
"I get a stomach dropping feeling first. If it's sustained then my chest will start to feel warm and it'll spread from there. If it's really bad then sometimes it'll have a focused feeling on my arms or my hip, but I think that one is more just because of some bad coping skills I used to have."
Stomach pains and indigestion. And an inability to make decisions.
"I get this hot but also cold feeling that washes over me from the top of my head down. Vision goes dark and or blurry, and I feel like Im going to crawl out of my skin. Also nausea, rapid heart rate increase, and sudden extreme sweating."
"You know that healthy amount of anxiety one might feel before a job interview; worries about appearance, what they might ask and how you might reply etc.

Multiply that by 50 and apply it to everything."
"It usually starts with a feeling like something awful is about to happen . Just out of the blue 

It’s almost like you feel like you are on a movie set and your wondering , ok who is the person that’s going to cause whatever this impending doom feeling is. 

Things get quiet and slow. 

Then it sometimes turns into a panic attack. 

Then starts the sweating , fast heart rate , nausea sometimes vomiting, shakes. Feels like there bricks on my chests and I can’t get a good intake of air . Chest  pains . 

Then I think , ok this is it , I’m dying .

My hands and feet sweat a crazy amount.  The shakes turn into convulsing. I throw up and have diarrhea. Im so dizzy. Pretty sure I’m going to faint . I need to hide in a bathroom or bed."
Constant butteflies
"It varies.  It can be a low-level barely perceptible nervousness, and it can be a full blown fight-or-flight adrenaline dump . . .or pretty much anywhere in between."
Mine comes through as almost an asthma attack. Very short of breath which just makes me panic even more.
Heart palpitations. Just an uncomfortable feeling. Imagine being stuck in traffic and just wanting to get home and relax but you can't.
Thunderstorms in my chest
"my lungs feel like a balloon i’m trying to blow up, and i feel like i’m strapped to a chair in a strait jacket. also my vision kind of clouds over? (like it would if you’re anemic). also the world doesn’t feel real, it feels and looks like i’m staring at a painting."
"It feels like my brain and heart are both being set on fire, then I deal with that for hours"
Increased heart rate
Just a feeling of dread… like when you know something bad is going to happen and instead you don’t know there is but you have that feeling… and it causes heart flutters and breathing trouble and maybe tears and nothing can take it away easily. Rationally you know things are fine but your body is reacting this way anyway.
Constant headaches that never stops
"Wearing a cold, wet shirt."
"Most people will probably report different physical sensations due to anxiety.  For me, it's rapid, pounding heart rate, a sensation of choking/pressure on my esophagus, and severe shakiness.  But the worst of it is the sensation that my insides are burning, like my blood is on fire."
"Imagine dipping a big spoon into a barrel of water.  Every time you have a thought, your spoon goes into the barrel and comes back up full of water, and your brain sips the water from the spoon.
 
Now imagine there's an oily film resting on top of the water, and every time you dip your spoon into the water, you have to get your spoon covered in thick viscous oil.

Some days, you can dip your spoon into a crystal clear barrel of sparkling water and feel refreshed. 
 
Some days, you can find holes in the oily film and get clean water that way. 

Some days, you're so thirsty you drink the oil and feel sick to your stomach 

And some days you just stay thirsty. 

It took a lot of thirsty and sick days to figure out that analogy, and now I drink around the oil as best I can and rest when I can't."
"Have you ever gone down a set of stairs and thought you hit the bottom but there was actually one more step?

It's the feeling right after that. I know there's nothing wrong because I'm still standing but there's a part of my brain going ""Am I going to fall?"", and that part might stop anywhere from minutes to hours later."
"It used to be the last hour before going to work. Wanted to stop the train and get off, no mater what the consequences would be.. just wanted to pause time or sleep. Lost that job anyway so all good now :D"
"Like small amounts of shock going through your chest, heartbeat rising and headache"
"A sharp stomach ache. It can can paralyzing. Lots of body aches, especially in the back, from being tense. I usually run a mild fever with it.

It sucks, man. Experiencing it now. My fight or flight won’t turn off. :("
"Stomach in knots, feels like you’re wrapped in a straight jacket."
It depends. Mostly it’s just constant feeling of your stomach dropping like when the elevator is going up/down
You that feeling you get when you are in a confrontation with some that could easily turn violent? Sort of like that… like I risk being punched in the face.
"For me it's like the really steep drop from the top of a roller coaster, that feeling in the pit of your stomach, but instead of lasting seconds it's permanently there."
Severe worry
Tunnel vision and feeling like I’m having a heart attack.
A tight knot in my stomach
Slight feeling in stomach. Slight feeling in chest. Insanely fast repitional thoughts of how I dont want to do this.
"It feels like my emotions are wearing a weighted vest.

When dealing with very acute / severe symptoms, it feels like my stomach becomes ice cold.  I get the shivers / shakes and can barely form a complete sentence."
"Shortest attacks are like the feeling skipping a stair. Sucks, but I can get over them fast enough.

Long attacks, I feel like my whole body is being constantly compressed in an uncomfortable whole body straight jacket, and the feeling does not go away for hours. It’s hard to breathe, there’s an uncomfortable pressure everywhere, and I feel paralyzed a lot of the time this happens."
Heart thumping on high alert generally feeling panicked
"Depends if I'm unmedicated.

My anxiety now is minor tension and agitation, I can live with it.

Without my anxiety medication, I can experience physical pain in my shoulder and a tension headaches. It was the worst when I was getting sober."
some sort of paralyzing static under my skin. Like my joints and limbs don't move properly anymore. like I can't breath because there's never enough air. Nauseating.
"I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack, in fact my BPM was so high I was not in normal sinus rhythm, went to the ER to find out that is just a totally normal panic attack."
Like a dense thundercloud forming inside my head that does not stop expanding
"Sweaty af.

It could be 30 degrees and without fail, when the anxiety hits, I'm sweating like a fat pig being led to slaughter."
"My heart is racing, my ears are ringing, and I'm starting to choke."
"You know that scene in spinal tap where it's turned up to 11.
Well it's that but self awareness."
" You know that feeling when you feel like you’re falling just as your drifting off to sleep? 

That, plus nausea. All day."
"My stomach drops, and I feel ice in my veins. Everything tenses up and I slowly go numb.


First my stomach, then my legs, then my arms. If I can't stop the panic attack eventually the numbness creeps up my neck until it feels like I'm wearing goggles. All I can feel is a tingle around my eyes. I can't move, I can't do anything. Just lay there and look around"
"Types of anxiety include:

panic disorders
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
separation anxiety
social anxiety
phobias
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)"
"Idek anymore, I’m so used to it. I guess heart rate increases. This isn’t physical feelings but I’ll start fidgeting and my mind gets noisy with voices telling me shit (like people are looking at me, I think about every inch of my body asking myself if every inch looks okay, wondering what people are thinking).

When I was a teenager I used to almost faint every day. I’d get hot and cold flushes, sweaty palms, dizzy, heart beating faster, hearing and vision go. I’d have to quickly sit or go outside, force myself to not faint by drinking water and hoping really. I’ve fainted a few times and once you get to a certain point you just accept it’s happening. I had been to the doctors a lot about it because my mum thought it was something to do with my blood pressure, but nope, turns out they were panic/anxiety attacks."
Like you absolutely can't be where you are.
"Like my brain is an old-timey machine made of gears and iron parts and is churning very very quickly and making concerning noises and becoming so hot that it starts glowing red. 

Sped up, shaking hands, headache, difficulty thinking, fight or flight turned all the way up."
"It feels like my heart and my brain is pounding at the same time, I get exhausted and heated up to terminal levels if it’s hot enough, and I also struggle to stand up or my body does something drastic on its own"
"Helplessness. Lots and lots of Helplessness. Physically, it feels like the walls are closing in. The physically symptoms aren't very bad, but it effects me mentally more. I feel Helplessness in everything I try to do. It makes me feel like I'm useless. Like I don't really matter. Even the small stuff causes this. At least on the bright side, I can exist. I KNEW I wasn't useless!"
"Like aids. Shun it wherever possible. Fuck it if it’s you.

I jest. It’s more akin to physical reactions to (bio-)hazardous contaminants. It can really mess you up good."
"It depends. Sometimes I honestly feel like I’m going to die because there is a sharp pain in my chest or side, which always goes away just fine but still causes the same amount of worry anyways.
Sometimes it’s loud noises or being in a social environment(not to be confused with being introverted). It’d be surprising to hear im actually a pretty extroverted person, I grew up this way. But sometimes, just out of the blue, my anxiety flares. And it feels like if I have to make eye contact or engage in conversation one more time I WILL EXPLODE. It really feels like a time bomb in your body and that the longer you’re in that social environment, the more you know the clock is closer to 0. 

Then there’s my background anxiety. I honestly hate this one almost as much as the phantom chest pains. They seem to have no trigger and just flare up for no reason. I call them background anxiety’s because unlike the other ones, they’re not mental but rather physical. Most of the time they will happen mid-conversation: a perfectly fine, no hostility, friendly conversation that is completely normal and in no way should make me defensive. Nevertheless my body thinks otherwise. I can’t count the amount of times where I’ve had to cut an interesting and awesome conversation short because my body decided mid-conversation “ok let’s give his face this burning sensation and make his tear ducts go on overdrive.” I tried a couple times to talk through this symptom but usually when the first tear comes down on a topic about golf they’re usually like “dude are u okay? What happened?”

Another background anxiety I also get for some reason is when I’m driving, I will be jamming to the radio having the chillest vibe known to man, then suddenly my body goes against my mind and decides to throw some anxiety in there. This one sucks because I will be driving and my eyes will just randomly start having an intense burning sensation. Half the time I have to pull over and pray it doesn’t happen on the highway because I have about 2 minutes before I can’t open my eyes at all, and if I do it’s for 2 millisecond and too blurry from all the tears.

There’s many other times where anxiety has ruined parts of my life. I wish I could say there’s an easy way out, but after dealing with anxiety for years and gotten to know its many different types, I realized everyone has to learn to handle it differently. For me, it was fixing my insecurities and taking a break from my vices. I went from skinny and working a job at 20 years old as a janitor to exercising and pursuing a lifelong dream of mine of attending college. I also cut back on the weed and alcohol which seemed to help just as much, tremendously actually. Although I never thought I ever could get off weed, as I bettered myself through education and exercise I began to realize the vicious cycle I was in: anxiety, weed to help with anxiety, weed causes more anxiety, repeat. And with much more to lose(college and my body) for the first time I actually believed I could quit, and I did. I still have a long road ahead but it’s getting better.

Anyways, what does anxiety feel like to me? 
It depends which type you’re talking about."
"The feeling of diarrhea but not actually being able to poop. Chest tightness like a sumo wrestler is standing on me. 

I manage it much better. Intervening and stopping intrusive through patterns at the onset was a game changer. Realizing you can actually train your brain to manage things before they snowball was such an immense breakthrough. 

Hopefully everybody in this thread can get there one day. The thoughts will never go away, but you CAN change how you manage when they do show up. ♥️"
"Depends on the situation. Stomach cramps that eventually send me to the toilet, if I’m lucky. If I’m not, the worse scenario is compulsive crying that comes on in waves that I cannot physically stop, even though my brain is perfectly aware that there is nothing to cry about. Thankfully, this has happened significantly less in recent years, but it made my life growing up a living HELL."
Nothing. All I see is possibilities.
"It’s like panic from a threat, but that threat is inside you, so you can’t run or hide and your body and brain are yelling at you “RUN!!  GET AWAY FROM DANGER!!!”  But you can’t run and you can’t do anything and you want to just disappear or not exist or something, anything to get away but you can’t get away from what’s inside you."
"You ever had to get a medical test like a biopsy that could potentially reveal a terminal illness and you had to wait several days to get the results? Well I haven't, but I imagine that feeling is similar to my anxiety. I don't KNOW that something catastrophic is about to happen, but I believe that it could, at any moment, so I can never feel at ease."
I never have anxiety so I wouldn’t know.
"Depends what's causing it and my mood. Usually it feels like I'm drowning and screaming inside and like I'm collapsing inwards, I can't sleep I'll only sleep when my body and my mind are physically exhausted, I feel sick like someone's kicking me in the stomach repeatedly, I have to piss every 10 seconds, I'm boiling hot and if there are intrusive thoughts they'll be rattling round in my head for a few days. Anxiety is like a sickness of the mind."
"Like you had a few to many coffes and u have this passive shake in ur body , 
You dont know whats going to happen.
Over observant .
You get all the sounds u possibly can hear in a place , moment .

Too much sensori information.
But still havin a good mood"
Like a slow steady drip of adrenaline trickling down my lungs and soaking into my stomach.
"For mild anxiety, to me it feels like I have this sinking feeling in my stomach. My heart starts to beat a little faster, my face starts to get little warmer. I feel a lot of dread but I can still function more or less. 

For high anxiety, I feel like it has become harder to breathe. My heart starts to race as fast as my thoughts. I become hyper aware of my surroundings. I either feel very afraid or very irritable depending on the trigger and become every quiet. These feelings just get worse and worse unless I find a way to calm down. I feel so drained afterwards to the point where I just sleep all day and/or do nothing. I hate it."
"a very cold sensation

like i'm a block of ice in the nether, not being able  to melt🤠👍"
"For me, it's like when you're a little kid and you left your closet door open but you can't close it because you're already in bed with the lights out and that feeling just lasts all day."
"Like a forcefield is stopping me from doing certain things, and this sort of mental haze where I can't think straight, a lot of jitters, just a very uncomfortable feeling."
"Elevated heart rate, freezes me in place

I dont have panic attacks, I shut down. Getting a lot better at handling it though!"
Worrying about the future
"Mine makes me feel extremely bloated. 

I always thought it was because I ate something weird. I’ve only recently linked it to my social anxiety, I’m 38 and been having these bouts of bloat since my 20s."
"Ever dreamed of falling (just before the WOMP and waking up)? Like that, but a little more numbed... and for wayyy longer"
"Anxiety, like depression, came to me when I was too young to know it wasn't normal so physical symptoms are hard to identify. I know the the anxiety and the depression aren't me, but they are a part of me. For the last 6 months it's been the worst it's ever been, after many years of happiness.

Mild social anxiety makes me sweat, particularly down my back. My mind darts from panic to panic but my outward reaction is undetectable unless you see my sweat marks. My heart feels like it's sinking and I deliberately, but unconsciously, 'repress' my breath, so I take in less air and release it more slowly, as if not to be heard breathing. I think this comes from having uncontrolled asthma for many years when I was young, and parents who would tell me off for having a wheeze.

Anxiety spirals are harder to notice. They go hand in hand with the depression and they don't come out of nowhere, so I'm usually in a low mood worrying about X, Y and Z before I realise what's actually happening. The best way I can describe it is it's like going past the event horizon. I'm already lost before I consciously notice that I'm in a bad place and won't easily be able to get out of it. These are happening more frequently recently and I'm trying to keep a relationship alive, friendships fulfilling, my job secure and a plan to start a family afloat and it's becoming harder and harder."
Nervous sizzly feeling in my upper stomach/chest
"Tingling sensation on my palms and foot, very vague chest pain, frequent bowel movements 😪"
"Tension in the shoulders, spare time spent with a running mind even if I'm not necessarily thinking of anything, and never taking a completely full breath"
"Having the walls of the room shrink over you: you feel more and more unable to escape, with no space to breathe, difficulty moving...

It can also be as someone else mentioned a clothing item getting tighter. Basically a representation of being unable to move and escape.

&#x200B;

Other times tho it can feel like being surrounded by noise, with people bumping into you continuously, so that you feel poked and attacked from multiple sides"
"Do you remember back in elementary school when you went around the room and took turns reading from the textbook?

For a lot of us, there was a real worry that we would accidentally stumble or stammer and thus, would be laughed at and made fun of by the other kids

To me, my anxiety feels like that...but on a scale of 1-10, that feeling from elementary school was like a 5 and my anxiety feels like an 11.

There's the pit in my stomach...like I am simultaneously starving and feel like I am about to puke at the same time

And my mind races.  It runs through every possible scenario where I might fuck up....or get fucked over

I get the chills

I sometimes start to shake

And often times I sweat profusely"
"Easily agitated, short fused, overall feeling that I might explode, OCD intensifies"
"When you throw up to the point it's just bile and dry heaving. The aftermath where your insides feel knotted and torn. You feel bereft of energy and you're scared that you'll throw up again. That coupled with feeling like you have to do something drastic or very dangerous to upend the anxiety.

Sometimes it lasts a few minutes. It's lasted me days and weeks before."
"I panic, like something is about to happen or has happened, but I can't place what or how to make it stop. And then I panic some more trying to figure it out."
"You know that feeling when you're in a roller coaster, right before it goes down?

This but non-stop"
"My doctor was asking if I have been experiencing any anxiety. I said no, but I have been experiencing excitement for no reason. Then we had to have a discussion on what the difference between anxiety and excitement was. Physiologically they are very similar."
"Hard to breathe, feeling like I’m going to faint, blurry vision"
Fixated on one specific thing and not being able to let it go until it’s resolved. Any problem big or small I can worry about that until it’s fixed
My muscles tend to hurt and it feels like my torso is being squished coupled with kind of a nervous pit in my stomach. I hate it
That feeling when you lean just a little too far back in a chair.
"My stomach hurts, and I usually have some digestive issues with it if you know what I mean.

I feel like my heart is getting squeezed tighter and tighter, my breath gets short and my thoughts are racing like crazy. It usually gets me on the edge of tears."
"I am feeling it like emptiness in my stomach. And this like falling from a highest. These feels with my for a long time over 20 years, every day, i'am very tired from it."
"Sometimes it feels like my thoughts cloud up like a bathroom mirror does and it becomes a fog.  Sometimes, I feel like somebody turned the gravity settings way up.  Sometimes, it feels like the ""voices in the room"" actually got into the room."
When it's bad it have a feeling the floor is going to collapse from under me or another feeling I get is a fear that the earth will stop spinning and any moment and everything will turn into messy debris. My breathing is fast and my heart is racing.
Intense sweating with the feeling of a weight being your chest. It fucking sucks.
Stomach pains and digestive issues
"It's like this... energy that roils in the pit of my chest, uneasy and restless. Then at certain points it will rise up in my chest and into my shoulders, making it hard to breathe. I can't figure out what to do with my arms, because I am just so aware of them now. Then as it gets worse, it is like it expands into the air around me like a heat haze that makes the air crystal clear to everyone around me, making them see me at the exact moment I don't want them to. Any touch send what feels like a seismic wave through my body, a thunderclap that I can feel but not hear. 

It's just as bad when it starts to pass. It just sits there with me like a friend that I don't like who won't leave. The air feels too close and too crisp and too real."
"My heart races, I sweat, I can't slow my breathing down, I get sharp chest pains, and I feel like I'm going to puke and often do."
"You know that feeling where you know you're gonna hit the ground from 10 feet up and you're anticipating the impact? That, but just in my shoulders and chest,  to a lesser degree"
It feels like you are going to die like actually will die your heart feels like it’s going 1000 miles per hour and you wonder “can a heart actually explode?” Then you tell yourseif “I won’t die” but the anxiety tells you no you might. It’s terrifying and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. Sometimes I stutter if it’s really bad and can’t feel my face or hands.
"The mental is much worse than the physical, but here’s what physically happens to me during an anxiety attack:

It feels like my blood turns so hot that it’s cold, and rushes from my scalp and down my back in waves. It’s the feeling of absolute, sheer panic. My heart races and won’t stop. I will violently be shaking so much my teeth chatter, and I can’t stop. I can’t breathe correctly. I have to force myself to breathe at a regular pattern. I also get so violently nauseated that my body forces me to vomit until there is nothing left, but will keep dry heaving after that."
"Lurking doom in my lizard brain that just keeps tickling my cortext like a snakes tongue, when the anxiety is light as it regularly is, and I just know something bad is about to happen and that Im a bad person who deserves it. When it's bad, my eyes weep and my chest feels like someone is standing on me and I feel a need to run and destroy. But I know I can't run and that it is my destruction coming through the trees in T-minus 5,4,3..."
"It depends on what's causing the anxiety. If it's relationship anxiety, I feel it in my gut for sure. It feels like my stomach is in knots and just twisting and twisting and twisting. 

&#x200B;

If it's almost any other anxiety, I feel it in my chest and it feels like there's a boulder on it."
"For me, it feels like someone is reaching into my gut and twisting my insides, while simultaneously putting pressure above my adam's apple and under my jaw. It feels like a stone crushing my ribs while my heart's beating to get out. It's like your biggest crush and your biggest manipulator are both walking up to you to say something, and you can't decide whether you want to ask one out, tell another to stop, or to just run as fast as you can."
"I am so tense that I am surprised that I don’t just crack, and it feels like you are going to die.  It feels really bad."
The middle of my back starts tingling and feeling hot
Chest pains and diarrhea
Like an electrical current is being run under my skin.
"A sickness in the pit of my stomach. A low nausea that feels like the worst type of fear the helpless, no hope I'm about to die type of fear"
"My most serious panic / anxiety attack = death is imminent but I can't pinpoint what's wrong. 

I've learned exercise helps me greatly."
"It feels like my chest went like a rock, I can’t breathe anymore, there’s no space for air"
"Day to day, it feels like butterflies in my stomach, racing heart rate, head ache, tension in my jaw, super distracted, my hands usually go numb after prolonged anxiety/stress. 

Panic for me usually starts with diarrhea, nausea to the point I’m leaning over the toilet sure I’m going to vomit, exhaustion but being wide awake with racing thoughts, every embarrassing or bad thing that’s happened to me on a loop in my head, night terrors. 

It sucks, it’s my every day experience and I wish it wasn’t."
Cloudy brain can't focus on anything. Overwhelming sense of dread like something is wrong but you can't put your finger on exactly what and like everything is going wrong at the same time
"Like your hand is off the steering wheel, it's terrifying"
"I always describe it as an alarm going off but I don't know what it's for or where it is. Then the chest tightens, shoulders lock, heart exploding through my chest. The feeling of being overwhelmed and needing to just go. Somewhere, anywhere, just not here. Feels like I'm breathing but not oxygen, a million pin pricks all over my skin and a deep deep feeling of dread. It's as fun as it's sounds."
"When its bad i start to feel numbing on hands and face,  my fingers start to go straight,  arms begin to curl like in rigor mortis position. Also face complete numb making it very hard to talk and move muscles. Stomach as well 

They became nore rare bust scares the shit out of me cause nobody can explain why"
"It feels like laying down and closing your eyes and trying to rest, and then a bunch of invisible arms grab you, thrust you up into a sitting position like you're on a stopping roller coaster, while some other invisible hands squeeze your heart rapidly, and another set of fingers peel your eyelids open whether you want them to be open or not. Then after a few minutes, just when you think it's passed, it happens all over again. And this just keeps happening and you can't make it stop."
"I feel flat like my brain disconnects. Sometimes my heart beats irregularly and my legs hurt like I want to run. If it’s really bad I lose feeling in my extremities, feel tingly like i’m not getting enough oxygen. When it’s over with i’m exhausted, everything hurts, and I feel like I have a constant head rush."
Strong chest pain and fast heartbeat
It’s fucking painful
"Tachycardia , shortness of breath"
A vacuum slowly draining me of my senses until I almost black out. Then when it passes it restores them.
My heart beating so fast it sinks to my stomach and feels like I’m floating but feels like I’m about to faint while also being chased by a rabid dog
"Neck, shoulder and back get tense and painful and if it’s really bad palpitations. Feel physically tired like I’ve been in the gym after it subsides"
"The first thing that happens is that I feel my heart start to speed up, and since I've had a lot of panic attacks, I know that heart palpitations are usually the first sign for me  and it's a quick downfall from there, which makes me even more anxious.

Then, I start getting this weird feeling in my stomach (almost like butterflies) and my chest, kind of like when you're holding your breath underwater and need to come up for air, so you come up but it still feels like there is something preventing me from being able to get any air in, and that's when the cycle properly starts, although sometimes I can still manage to breathe through it if I notice it quickly enough.

I usually don't notice it at first, though, and I begin to breathe faster to try to ""get enough air"", and it very quickly dissolves until just purely hyperventilating. I can feel my chest move, but I can't feel any oxygen getting in. My hands and feet start to tingle and go numb due to the hyperventilation, and that makes me think for at least a moment that I am going to faint or that I'm going to die. My throat becomes completely dry and it hurts to breathe because it just feels as though I can't get enough air. I feel practically frozen because all I'm trying to do is breathe, and I feel like I can't move.

That's typically the point when I either let someone know that I'm having a panic attack, or if I'm in the middle of talking to someone and it happens (because if I tell someone I'm feeling this way, it generally kick-starts it completely), that's when they realise and try to help. But even as I start calming down from it, my head starts to feel even lighter at first, like I'm floating, however that's the feeling of calm that I need washing over me, even if it temporarily makes me dizzier than during the panic attack. 

After the panic attack subsides, I'm basically just a trembling mess and my throat is dry to the point where it's painful. I can still feel my heart hammering away, but I can keep my breathing controlled and slow so that I don't fall back into the spiral.

And sometimes, even when I'm not having a panic attack, if I start worrying about something, my stomach gets filled with those butterflies and my head hurts because it feels like too many thoughts are in there and my brain is about to explode. That kind is a bit easier to manage by talking to my friends.

Anxiety is different for everyone, though, and this is just my personal experience of it, and I hope that if any of y'all have anxiety or panic attacks, that you can learn how to cope and manage them."
That feeling in your stomach you get on a roller coaster. But for hours.
Mine manifests as an Upset stomach. And overall jitters.  So if I’m nauseous I have to stop and ask myself if I’m anxious or if it’s something else. Like vitamins on an empty stomach.
For me it's like a mental weight that lays on top of me until whatever is causing the anxiety goes away. In the meantime I feel like I can't move or do much of anything or focus on anything else until the source is gone.
A heart attack.
Feels like there's a fucking lead ball stuck in my throat. Like there's electricity coursing through my whole body.
"For me it differs (is that a word?) from a slight uncomfortable feeling to physically wanting to puke.

If I have some light anxiety about something stupid like maybe I forgot something I get uncomfortable in my skin and have to physically touch it to make sure I'm still alive or something. I don't know what the actual reason for it is but I'll start holding my wrist and neck.

If I'm stressed about about something like a project I forgot to finish I get really jumpy, can't sit still and my head is a mess. I can't focus on anything and my head is in pure chaos, since I have this very regularly I always listen to music. Especially metal and really energetic music like touhou help. Worst case I shoot into panic and then I'm just running around without a purpose and can't do anything.

If I have to do something like public speaking I just start feeling unwell. Like I have a bad fever (talking 39-40 degrees) and want to puke. Nothing really helps this so I avoid it at all costs."
My stomach feels like a balloon is inflated inside and about to explode. The only thing that will stop it is a steaming hot bath. What is it about hot baths and showers that makes it go away?
Highly caffeinated hamster running in a convoluted tunnel maze in my head
"Mine is different from time to time. Could be a tense, full body clenching. My nails grip into my palms leaving half moon marks. It’s like every muscle in my body is engaged. (fight) 

Sometimes I mask it to the point of having other emotions like anger (flight)

Other times, I’m nauseous and shaky like a cold sweat. Or I just crumble into tears (freeze/faun)"
"Stomach pains, headaches and if it’s really bad, shaking."
Fast heartbeat
"Like a tight clamp around my head and chest, just squeezing."
"Like hearing the battle music in a video game but you can't find the enemy. Or that feeling when a cop turns on the flashing lights behind you when you're driving, but the feeling doesn't go away. Tense, stomach drops, and all your senses are ready for something to go horribly wrong."
"Shortness of breath (not actually short of breath, just feels like it)
Sometimes total loss of appetite/nausea
Shaking and losing balance"
Dying
Crying. Heartbeat accelerated. Can't breathe probably. Pain in chest. And pain in your eyes from fighting tears and trying to hide it
Like someone is slowly draining the room I'm in of air
"An anxiety attack? Depends. Mild ones will present as rapid heartbeat, difficulty to breathe, and the thought that everyone is staring at me and they *know* something is wrong with me. 

The worst ones I’ve had brought on a very rapid heart rate, feeling like I can’t breathe whatsoever, black spots in my vision/my vision slowly closing off (hard to explain), close to fainting, and a ringing in my ears like tinnitus. I have to stop what I’m doing, sit down, cover my ears, close my eyes, and focus on my breathing until I come back down. 

General feelings of anxiety usually present in me as feeling flush/hot and like a ball of barely contained energy. I get snappy and irritated easily until I get away from the source of anxiety.

edited for typos"
"For me it is a fight or flight response.
Big crowds typically will trigger it.

Imagine someone releasing a hungry tiger into the crowd and it licks it lips while staring intently at you. That feeling of dread, that gut wrentching feeling of ""I have to get out of here now!"" That is what anxiety feels like.

Now imagine your friends laughing it off saying it will be fine, asking what's wrong, or worse, your significant other refusing to leave and they have the keys to the car.

Thats when the second part kicks in.
At this point it is survival. Nothing is actually wrong with where you are it, but if you don't get away from it, the impending doom and dread turns into aggression and a total lack of disregard for others.

So imagine the crowd is now zombies.
Your friends have become infected and they have the keys so you take the keys at the first opportunity, push people away and haul ass out of there.

This feeling is almost immediately followed by manic crying, guilt, and selt loathing.

Fortunately I am now surrounded by family and friends that get it and dont ask questions if I suddenly leave. 

If you or someone you know suffers anxiety attacks, let them know they are not alone, and like all moments in time, it will pass and better times will come."
Like I’m a wooden barrel spontaneously filling with smoke that for some reason is too thick to bleed through gaps in the wood.
"""I'm in a hurry all over""-Curly Howard"
"It's been many years since I've had one. Been on medication almost 22 years. I had two types. The anxiety started with being very afraid but not knowing what to be afraid of. I could not go to work for a week when that started. My parents took me to a regular doctor. Mom said I was experiencing nerves. This happened after my divorce which is strange because I wanted the divorce and there was never much of a marriage. We were roommates basically.
The fear went away with medication but I began to have physical symptoms. And darn it if it didn't always happen in a staff meeting! Tingling starting from my head and down my arms. Nausea that turned into a dry cough. Would have to leave the room to heave in the bathroom. Mouth would fill with saliva. Had to spit and spit until it would stop. Embarrassing when someone came looking for me in the bathroom. 
It wasn't the divorce, it was the stress of my father in law having and dying from cancer. The daily visit at the hospital or rehab center he was at. My husband pressuring me to meet him there daily at the hospital. And for what? To be ignored by him. And if I didn't show up, I got the silent treatment at home. Very stressful time. I divorced him 6 months after my father in law died.
These physical anxiety attacks went away and it took years. My body and mind needed peace."
Like a buzzing of bad energy and every muscle tensing up at once.
"Heart fluttering, indigestion, dizziness and vertigo. Feeling somewhat on the edge, like something is about to happen, like, passing out."
"Like your trapped and constantly re living life, day by day!
Same routine, same everything. It’s horrible and draining, it feels like you’re being weighed down under water with bricks attached to you."
Heart racing and having a pit in your stomache that feels like doom
"Heart attack/palpitations , feeling frozen like I cant move, feeling of falling"
Like all of a sudden I have porcupine spines all over me but they also stabbed me don't get too close don't yell at me I might punch you in the face. You're not yourself you're not anyone you ever wanted to be and after it's gone all you're left with is this horrible snail trail of self recrimination and disgusting self-awareness.
Lot of people confusing panic attacks with anxiety attacks in here.
"If I'm walking forward I get the sensation that I'm being pulled backwards, down and to the left this causes me to over exaggeratedly lean forward and stumble somewhat.

That or if I'm nit moving I feel like I'm falling through the floor"
"i have social anxiety, and to me it feels like if you got into a fight with your family right before a vacation with them, always on edge and worried about what would happen"
"That feeling when you miss a step, yea that all day."
"You know that feeling you get when you’re cruising down the highway and suddenly see a cop? It’s like that, all the time."
"Tight, painful chest, dry heaves, clamminess and of course… stress pees."
"it’s sort of like… when you’re leaning back in your chair, and you go too far, and you’re about to fall. And you get this kind of almost painful, terrifying rush. It’s like that, but it doesn’t fade."
"Mild anxiety - something I could best describe as feeling of weight in the chest.

Stronger or long-lasting anxiety, either headache centered on top of the forehead or dissociation which feels like combo of losing track of time and feeling like you are doing everything in 3rd person."
"A sharp sting and drop from my stomach that spreads towards my chest. I stop breathing for a few seconds. Body goes stiff. And intense butterflies in my stomach that feels like electric current. Blue in color and cold. Duration varies, but most of the time it's over in 5-10 seconds. When it goes on for minutes, or even hours, I shake a lot, and have cold shivers. Even my voice cracks. Probably because of the amount of adrenaline over time."
Not just stomach discomfort but actual pain in my stomach. I’ve learned that tums really help along with my anxiety medications. Also my heart rate spikes.
"Other posters have covered most of the symptoms, but I wanted to add the feeling of being an animal trapped in a cage too small. Like you need to scream or cry."
"I don’t have it too bad, more I get a stutter and since a break up I’ve a bit of a tick thing when I’m extra anxious that I can’t seem to get a handle on. Often it’s a tightness in my chest and mind racing."
Like someone shoved you out of a moving train 4 seconds before
"Like my body is vibrating from the inside out. The floor feels like it's falling out from under me (when after you get off a boat or an elevator), my chest feels tight and it's hard to take a deep breath. I often get very tight muscles around my shoulders and neck that lead to headaches.

Real fun times."
"I feel like I wanna poop, also I get a feeling like when you're not hungry but you try to force feed yourself."
feel like i have to shit but I'm not allowed to go to the bathroom
"Choked up throat, pressure in my chest, restless leg x1000"
It feels like a frog is in my throat and then a weird pit below my stomach followed up by what feels like my heart racing but there is no increase in my resting heart rate.
Like a craving for a xanax bar
It feels as if someone shackled your ankles and arms or if you had fell in a dream just haven't hit the floor and woke up yet
"There's usually a subtle stirring in the pit of my stomach, other times it can be accompanied by any of the following/mix & match: extremely violent stirring in the stomach, nausea, sweating, shaking, pacing, fast talking, holding my breath, my breath at the top of my chest/having trouble getting words out because I can't breathe, dizzy & lightheaded, heart racing & palpitations, head buzzing, ears ringing, skin crawling, and vicious diarrhea."
Like a very tight belt around my stomach. My head gets faster and emptier and it's hard to move. I wanna throw up and over all I just have this weird feeling  in my brain
"Everything closing in and things cutting off, heightened intensity and scatteredness.  Maybe more body & physical feeling would be cold lightning flying through me and a feeling of dissociation with what's around me."
Fingers rolling up my upper back and neck while simultaneously pushing me down.
Breathing+
"It gets hard to breathe, and I randomly tear up sometimes"
"Nausea to start working it's way into suffocating, the worst part is as you notice yourself starting to panic it only feeds it and makes it worse."
"A vaccum above my stomach, and a feeling of complete and total lack of Control... Then I get hot, really hot... 

Fortunatly I only have this atacks in some stressfull situations and not daily like some people. I can also calm down in 20min-1h."
"My body becomes heavy, my eyes keep tearing up, my head feels like it's about to explode but not from a headache, chest pain, I get shaky and my heart beats weirdly, sometimes I feel paralyzed and just can't make myself move."
"I used to get physically sick like literally vomit in new social situations. Now I have pretty much gotten past that. But I still have anxiety almost all the time, it's like my heart is working too hard, I have repetitive and unwanted thoughts, I obsess about different things and can't get them out of my head. 

If I start having a panic attack I'll usually start to get tunnel vision And feel like I'm gonna die or pass out. Hyperventilating etc. I can usually catch them early enough now to avoid the worst of it, but they still come on sometimes. The worst (and most common) time for me is when I'm driving 

For me anxiety is very physical and it's honestly so awful. I yearn for a day when I can go a week at a time without that panicky feeling in my chest and head"
"Like there's someone chasing me, or that there's something desperately wrong I need to handle or it will kill me. But there's not. I'm sitting on the couch doing absolutely nothing."
"Cold while wearing 3 sweaters. Not shakey hands, but they feel floaty and disconnected. Feels like a miniature bowling ball is in my gut, somehow I always imagine that it’s the size of a size 2 soccer ball. And I have an unusually high amount of energy, but it’s all being used on pacing, rambling to support figures, and other anxiety-related reactions"
Reading these is giving me more anxiety
Heart attack and sometimes stroke like symptoms
If you were able to dial down burning at the stake to maybe 15%
"i’ve been suffering from multiple types of anxiety- the one that i feel the most is panic disorder. 

it starts with a thought, then it turns into the expression “a pit in my stomach”. suddenly i’m gasping and it feels like i’m having my lungs squeezed out by a snake."
"its like a trip ud like to not take even on ya worse days!\~

I have had a major stress attack once an it was not fun at all, ya body locks up and its a bitch to move!\~"
Stomach pains.
I always said it is like sitting on your bed safe and sound but feeling like you are drowning.
Cold sweats....no appetite.... hemorrhoids....dry heaves...waking up super early wide awake remembering what it is your anxious about...
"Light anxiety - your head wants to move around to look, you will start to figdet with whatever you're holding

Mild anxiety - you start to lose concentration of your surroundings, your heart starts to beat fast, your body starts to shake

High anxiety - your mind is spinning, your heart feels like it's gonna pop out of your chest, your body feels weak, tired and you're feeling nauseous.

This is from personal experience. I know not everyone will have the same experience."
"Baseline everyday anxiety: Hunger for sweets. Desire for sex. Tightness in my chest and muscles.

Panic attack level anxiety: my fingers and toes feel like they're vibrating. I feel like my consciousness is being altered and I'm about to die at any moment."
"Really depends on the anxiety. Interview or presentation, bubble guts. Jumping out a plane, numbness. General, everyday anxiety? I feel like my lungs want to come out my throat, I feel like I need to literally put my head through a wall just to get of this feeling away from me"
"Chest tightness, diffuculty in breathing , increased heart rate , concern, feeling like your are about to pass out(never happens), or flling like your chest will burst out, tingling in hands and one time it was like all the sounds around me was meaningless and my field of view shrinked. All of these arr what I remember from tge past never felt for a long time"
"You know that feeling watching a movie where the music tenses up, and you know something terrible is about to happen, but you don’t know what it is?

It’s that feeling, but it doesn’t stop even when you know that it’s not real."
Heart palpitations and sometimes headaches. I can't think clearly.
like ive just been told im gonna die in exactly 5 seconds but when that 5 seconds pass they tell me they calculated wrong and i will in 5 more seconds for sure and that just keeps repeating for hours
I begin to feel numb. My chest tightens so badly I can barely breathe. My movements are labored. My skin begins itching so badly I become miserable. My fretfulness leads to deeper depression. Both can heighten my slide into another severe bout with my fibromyalgia. Gasp!
"Constant negative judgement/thoughts of things, whether currently happening or not, with the end result never in my favor. Why can’t it be good thoughts of me winning or doing well? I dunno. Have you ever seen that picture of chakras in the body? There’s a big round ball in the middle of the chest. That area feels like it’s a swirling force of not so good energy for me."
Mine used to be a knot in my chest that was constantly there and would get worse at night. I used to say that I felt like I needed to slit my skin open from head to toe to relieve the pressure.
Like I pounded a quad-shot expresso from Sbux in less than 5 minutes.
That feeling you get when your in trouble except you don’t know what for.
I get a pit feeling in my stomach
"sinking feeling in chest, knots in stomach, fight or flight"
"Emotional feelings aside, it feels to me like there's a football -sized lump in my chest that I wish I could just cut out and get rid of. That and fear, worry, panic, guilt, feeling antsy and restless."
"It’s like playing a bad balance act. On your left and right are 140 foot drops, and you’re constantly wobbling."
Feels like an elephant is sitting on your chest.
Hot very very hot
"You know that feeling when you think you are falling then wake up. Like that, but without the waking up part. Sometimes it also feels like someone is sitting on your chest."
"It feels like my normal

Every minute of every day is an anxious mess

It feels like I'm uncomfortable at the best of times, like I'm prickly with hot and cold flashes as it gets worse, and then like I'm drowning on fire and my heart is beating out of my chest at the breaking point.

It's inescapable"
"Heart beating hard, can't catch my breath, tingling fingers, sometimes even dizziness"
"I don't know. It feels like you will die, but you don't know why, or maybe you do, and no matter what anyone says, you don't believe them because you know for a fact you're going to die. 

Then you calm down, and the embarrassment from your acts cause you more painal. 

Eventually, after 1000000 panic attacks, you give up because you realize no one is going to save you, and sometimes reality is less of a pain in the ass than the actual panic attack. 

Idk"
Like a random car crash
Falling from a building while also wanting to rip my skin off and escape.
"Generally, for me, it feels like I’m standing on the edge of a building and someone is just about to push me from behind or pretend to. 

That flush of adrenaline and fear? Yeah that doesn’t go back down. 

My stomach and upper diaphragm will just clench and stay that way so it feels like I can’t get a full breath, which can last for days and weeks.

Over several weeks, it leads to a burning pain in my neck, shoulders and mid to lower back because all my muscles have contracted and stay that way.  I can’t sleep, I feel nauseous and just consumed by this constant, unrelenting, burning pain."
"The extreme for me feels basically like everything in the world happening all at once three inches from my face...

The lesser side feels kind of like trying to focus on one too many things at once and I just can't do it."
Butterflies in the stomach and a wobbly gyroscope inside your head
"Felt like I'm trapped both in my presence and overthinking mind, and I need to escape but I can't because I would let someone down. Eg, in a social setting with an extroverted friend who bounce from peer to peer and left me alone."
I was extremely wound up during one phase of my life and was grinding my teeth so hard at night that I snapped off my front tooth while I was sleeping - was so tired from stress that I didn’t even care and just went back to sleep
"Like I can’t think straight and sit still , plus it makes a little nauseous and very tired."
"For me its like being stuck in a full body cast, so unable to move but every muscle in my body, esp. my legs is screaming that I have to run"
I don’t know.  I wrap it in meh and forget about it.
"That split second feeling when you just been told someone close to you has died. 
Before the panic and crying starts."
To me anxiety is like holding your breath. An anxiety *disorder* is like someone else holding your breath
"Like someone made the oxygen in your lungs 1.25x lighter without making your lungs any more efficient. Stuttered inhales, a tight but generalized feeling of cold heat in your chest but sort of not exactly in it at the same time."
"It feels like theres a brick wall between what I want to do/say and me. When I push myself to do whatever, it just hurts more the harder I push till I stop pushing."
"Physically, top of my head is burning hot & buzzing and feel sick to my stomach . Hands fuzzy & sweaty"
The first thing that happens is a tingling sensation on the top of my feet. Then my heart is beating out of my chest and a shaky feeling in my limbs where I feel like I may trip or fall because I'm not sure of my footing. Add to this a tightness in the top of my head that feels like I have an ill-fitting bathing cap on. Nausea may or may not present itself.
I’m 19 years old . Anxiety mostly affects me in my chest. I don’t know what the word is but I would call it “mini heart attacks” cause’ it feels like a heart attack since it’s a tight painful pressure I feel in that area along with my stomach and my back. I experience this pain a lot especially when I worry and I always do about everything. Some days the mini heart attacks last about 20 seconds or less and I would have to press my hand against it with my eyes closed hoping it would just go away. The worse days when I experience the most anxiety would be when the mini heart attacks last longer than a minute and that’s when I’m holding my chest while laying on the cold floor until it goes away. The sad thing is I don’t know what this is called or if anyone else experiences the same thing. Every doctor I went to said it’s normal and everyone has anxiety and depression. It’s honestly the worse thing I ever felt-since it happens a lot. It could be tomorrow or the day after or even next week but it’s bound to happen again soon.
It's like when you look in the rear view mirror and see a cop behind you
"Shaking, crying (this is the most frustrating as it's uncontrollable), fast heartbeat, nausea, sweating. If it's really bad - like I can't breathe. Also a feeling that is pretty indescribable: feeling of dread/heaviness in chest/stomach"
"I find it hard to breathe, dryness, and I stutter more than usual. I can't think in stressful situations"
"Existential dread and a feeling of impending doom. I’d imagine it’s like if someone bottled the feeling in a man’s stomach standing in front of a firing squad right before they get the order to shoot. 

Sometimes it also feels like Plato’s cave. I’m sitting in the cave watching the shadows outside and not seeing it’s not the full reality."
Social anxiety is like feeling like a prey animal. Must hide.
It feels like me picking and biting at my fingertips and nails until they’re raw and bloody.
Death
"Depends. Sometimes it’s just an off feeling. Like being slightly on edge but unable to calm down. Increase heart rate/irregular beat. Sometimes chest pain and nausea, sudden lethargy. 

Panic attacks are worse. For me that feels like my body is on fire from head to toe, tingling and extreme discomfort washing over my body in waves. Thankfully it’s been a couple years since one of those."
"It depends what kind of anxiety:

For anxiety from getting in trouble: I feel a slight pain in my chest similar to a weighted feeling. I get clammy and cold sweats. My throat hurts like that feeling you get before you cry. I get shaky and I'm also really queasy. If I were to describe it it'd be like I'm trapped under a pile of snow from an avalanche. 

For anxiety about something new: I tend to doubt my decisions and I'm also shaky. I get really fidgety and vigilant. I'm constantly looking around and studying my surroundings. I watch other people and copy their actions if I'm unsure of something. It almost feels like I'm trapped in a dark and mysterious woods."
Like your falling about to hit the ground and your heart races and you just want to cry and your stomach churns and hurts
Breathing in and not able to catch your breath.
"Depends on intensity: 

Anxiety attack: very fast heart, pounding heart, short of breath, feels like throat is closing up, pins and needles. 

Very stressed: shaking, dizziness, nausea, same heart stuff but less intense

Everything else: Headaches, being tense, itchiness, clammy hands, cold hands, sweating. Anxiety in general can trigger my IBS.

In terms of how the actual emotions can feel: Stomach dropping, generally weird feeling in my stomach, a pressure in my chest, a surge of something unpleasant. Mostly hard to describe tbh."
"Tightness. In my jaw, in my neck, in my shoulders and in my chest."
It feels like I'm going to have an asthma attack and heart palpitations and the world is gonna end.
"I’m very antsy, my body temperature gets a little hotter causing me to sweat, my heart rate increases and it’s like I’m shaking internally (like I physically feel like all the nerves in my body are shaking on the inside but on the outside I’m not actually shaking)

*edit “hear” to “heart”"
"I lose all strength in my body to do anything, I feel weak and gasping for air. Feel like I’m about to die honestly"
"Nagging “restlessness leg” feeling in the mind and whole body that makes me tremble and want to squirm.  Zero concentration or interest in anything other than whatever is causing the anxiety.  Also a racing heart and a sensation in the stomach kind of like hunger cramps except there’s no way I could possibly eat.  It’s fun stuff all around, really."
The feeling in your stomach when you go down a hill on a roller coaster. 90% of the time
Like there water stuck in my chest or the feeling you get right before a roller coaster drops or a hollowness inside my bones
Can't function with it.
"Im not sure if this is actually anxietybut whenever im high up like on the second floor or something and look down to the ground, my stomach feels very... odd. Im not sure how to explain it."
Like stage fright on steroids.
"Like a 400 pound weight on my chest.  Barely inhale, exhale to much."
"I feel my face warm up, my legs feel like jelly and I lose focus, It's like I suddenly have tunnel vision and can't focus on anything except what's in front of me"
Like a bubbling welling of pain and discomfort within. It grows larger and larger quicker and quicker until you feel like you can’t breathe. I have only ever gotten to the point where I could not breathe once and that was when I found out my wife (now ex) was cheating.
"I get such a physical reaction to my anxiety, the racing heart and breathing is out of whack, I get super cold too which I don’t know if that’s something other people experience but I have to fully wrap myself up like a burrito, sick feelings in the stomach, dizzy and just really scatter brained"
"Like being swallowed by my own body, becoming smaller and tighter until I’m nothing"
Fidgeting and twitching. Inability to sit still and calm
"Shortness of breath, feeling hot, feeling restless, feeling like I’m going to crap my pants. But mainly the not being able to get in a deep breath part is the worst for me"
Can’t sleep and awaken often worrying and obsessing about something. Unable to focus because my thoughts are completely zeroed in an an issue. The urge to roll up into a ball and scream.
"To me, it feels like six dogs are chasing me constantly."
Too much going on in my head to be able to put a complete thought together.
"Tightness in my chest and then a frozen feeling. I can't make a decision,  I can't function,  I can't do anything.  But my brain is going in a million directions and I can't slow down the thoughts in my head."
"Heart racing and pounding, swirly stomach."
"Restless, racing thoughts, ambient sounds become unbearably loud, other senses are heightened to an extreme, an urge to go somewhere, anywhere, else."
"For me I’ll start to feel jittery. My heart will start racing and I’ll think about my breathing. Then I’ll start to get hyper aware. I’ll feel like everything is going 100mph and I’m trying to process it all. A million thoughts will rush in and imposter syndrome starts to ramp up. I’ll begin to become over stimulated and start trying to ground myself by tapping my thumb to each finger in my right hand and counting. Suddenly everyone is talking about me and I shouldn’t be here. They are going to know I’m a fake. 

Usually I can balance it out with these edibles that are made for social situations and calms that behavior. It’s really nice but man is it bad if I forget them and get caught off guard by an anxiety attack"
"i get super nauseous when im anxious and most of the time ill make myslf throw up to get rid of it. i'll get the feeling in my stomach and then it makes me worried more, causing the urge to grow. also, if i think im about to puke, i either start talking a lot or not talk at all and zone out. 

if its an ""in the moment"" kind of thing, like someone yelling at me, it feels like a super tight ring gets wrapped around my head and my face feels hot. sounds weird but thats the only way i can describe it."
"It feels like pins and needles, but like… inside me? Mostly around my genitals, chest, back, and stomach. The pins and needles are very hot and itchy. Feels like what I imagine the exact opposite of an orgasm would feel like. Same areas of sensation, but instead of overwhelming euphoria, it’s overwhelming dysphoria that’s almost unbearable. It feels as if there is acid in my veins and body, but a lot more intense in those areas I listed."
Well I often feel anxiety in my life. Maybe it's because of my traumas maybe there is another reason but generally for me It feels like that something bad will happen to you in a few moments or days. The body will tremble sometimes and it may make some instant moves. It also feels like something heavy is on your chest and shoulders. Anxiety for me is just a feeling of fast coming end or strong hit of life that for overcoming and recovery will require a lot of energy.
"Yep same, drop tower feeling or when you miss a step but located a bit further up in your stomach."
Stomach pains and indigestion.
"Sometimes, every 5 months or so, something happens I dont understand. I just do something, like walking from one room to another, and then suddenly I feel nothing like panic. Without any reason, I cant go on walking or thinking or feeling anything. There is nothing but this pure horrible feeling. It goes away after some minutes gladly but ""tripped but havent caught yourself"" hits the point on the spot pretty well."
Or if you tip back just slightly too far on a chair
Whoa... That's... Yeah.
"Yeah spot on, it's just constant tension all day. The feeling if you finally get a minute or two where you miraculously can un-tense is orgasmic"
"Same for me..it's like butterflies, but not in a good way. it's sorta like if the butterflies are being squeezed into a smaller and smaller space and keep trying desperately to get out...but your body is trying to keep them in by tensing your muscles and wanting to throw up, but you cant."
You are definitely not over dramatic. I literally feel the butterflies and my heart beat just pounding so hard that I feel like I can hear it. You can look at me and I look completely unfazed. It’s truly a fucking phenomenon.
omg i’ve never found someone whose vision also goes in a panic attack! samesies.
Same symptoms for my PTSD. I just booked an ice bath to see if that helps reset my system during or after these. Hopefully it makes me feel less like shit because I've tried everything else.
This is called disassociation
"That is real, and moreover the feeling of runaway from the situation but you understand that anyways it will get you. So in order to save more energy you just passively wait for the thing happen"
The sweating. I hate it. My body feels really hot and I sweat and then I’m freezing.
"I don’t think I’ve ever lost vision, but everything else is identical to my panic attacks."
"...Everything or nothing in particular, just a vague general feeling with no discernable root."
Damn this is accurate. Including interviews.
"I just get the first part. There’s never any physical manifestation or outlet, just that first part sinking in and growing like this horrible realization that you’re fully understanding the implications of."
"You're the only other person on this thread that's mentioned the internal burning sensation.  For me it's throughout my body, like my blood is on fire.  I have to deal with it for hours as well, and sometimes it starts the instant I wake up."
What medication are you taking that helps? ❤️
Wow! This describes my experience to the point.
This is exactly what I'm experiencing.... I've never had this before and it's been 5 days. I'm really just wanting to scream at this point...
Mine does too
I used to take panic attacks in my sleep and my vision was psychedelic. Scared me shitless.
Have you been following the magic mushroom studies?
It feels like your only 5 percent there it's scary
"Feels like whatever I just thought about is causing my reality to tear apart at the seams. Such a weird thought, and it makes me feel crazy afterwards that I was ever worried about that ever happening."
"Oh yeah it's definitely throughout my body too, just emphasis on my chest and head. I totally get having it come up upon waking up"
"My really bad panic attacks have been like this, but the sensation comes and goes in waves for me. For me it would be small waves of discomfort that grow into intense, long waves of burning pain under my skin. You two are the first I’ve heard of beside myself who experience the burning sensation besides me too."
"Buspar 2x a day and Hydroxyzine as needed.

I can barely work without Hydroxyzine."
"After I started medication, it's not nearly as bad. I have GAD..So everything make me anxious without medication. It's not for everyone, but it worked for me 🙂"
Vision and hearing here.
Yes. It helps but there are diminishing returns so it's not something you can do functionally for very long.
"Well, you know it then.  Hopefully you're not substance abusing to deal."
"Ah ok so not an antidepressant….why did you not try one fir your anxiety instead? 

That sounds hard, sorry for you ❤️ I haven’t been able to work for 4 years, I’m not functional unfortunately xxxx"
Thankfully I haven’t had a major attack in a couple years. Been on meds and used to see a therapist.
"Am i the only one who really doesnt remember exactly WHEN my mental illness started?
Like i have a rough timeline but not EXACTLY and have no idea what my first symptoms were. It was 10 years ago."
"I’ve always had manageable anxiety since childhood, but lately it’s gotten out of control and unmanageable. I’ve been dealing with a lot of stress and overwhelm that I think built up over time and about a month and a half ago I had a panic attack and my anxiety has been out of control since then. I feel like a different person. I started meds (Lexapro) almost 3 weeks ago and I’m hoping they make a difference. I’ve had some good days since starting meds, but definitely not back to normal yet. I’m trying all of the things…keeping routine, engaging in things I enjoy, living life, but getting through each day has been ROUGH. I wish you luck."
"I’ve been incredibly anxious since I was a child. Back then, it was always nausea and vomiting over anything. Going to school, going to a new place, going on a road trip. All of it made me so sick to my stomach. As I got older I realized that wasn’t normal, and you shouldn’t just be puking at the thought of going places you’re unfamiliar with. I didn’t fully understand that I had anxiety, or get diagnosed, until I was in my 20s though. In hindsight, so many things made sense. 

The physical symptoms are a huge giveaway, and a big piece of advice I was given was to catch those physical signs and work on ways to cope with them before they start to spiral. The coping part is different for everyone though! Sometimes it’s incredibly hard to stop it, but it gets easier with time and practice"
"Childhood. I would not talk to clerks in shops when buying items or whispered so quietly they could not here me. Also separation from my mother when starting primary school. I was frantically hitting the teacher as she blocked the exit, everyone laughing at me. This continued for weeks."
"I distinctly remember laying my head on my desk to read a book in my lap at the end of 6th grade. When I stood up, I got dizzy and it triggered a panic attack. That was my first real experience. I’ve been on and off since then. Usually health issues brings the anxiety back, then it leaves when my health improves."
"I had anxiety my whole life but it seemed manageable. However, after covid happened It got worse. Then when i started a new job it got worse, then when I had a few triggering events it got super worse (car accident and stomach bug, I’ve had a big fear of that) I’ve since quit the stressful job and focus on school. Fewer panic attacks but I’m still just surviving each day it feels like. I got prescribed lexapro but as always, Im anxious to take that. I also started therapy last year and that has helped a little bit as well."
My hands shook. After that not just hands but arms and legs. I felt fear worry.
"In 3rd grade I started to wake up first once a week then every other night then every night in a panic attack, convinced I was going to die. Lots of meds after that and lots of trial and error. I’m 25 now and still have never found a medication that works for me without insane side effects."
I would have visceral reaction to the doorbell ringing and had to go hide when guests came.
There is a video of my as a toddler anxiously biting my nails while my mum tells me to stop. So I’m guessing it’s been a long ass time
Pounding heart; I literally can feel it before it starts. It’s like my mind just knows
Looking back I think my first signs were how panicky I would feel in social situations or in presentations in college. I later became a teacher and it was so much to handle that I remember my heart would be racing and I would start to get really red - I went to see a doctor and started medication which helped tremendously and so much so that it made me regret not going to a doctor about it sooner.
"I have had anxiety since I was young. Childhood trauma. 4 years old is my first memory of being anxious and I am now almost 49.

I have been getting help for my anxiety for over 20 years and it wasn’t until my current therapist that I have had any actual change in my anxiety. She has helped me flip the switch in a way. I still have anxiety but not to the same extent and it doesn’t rule my life like it used to. I am finally learning to live *with* it. 

I am also on meds because for me, being off meds is just a no-go situation. I may be on them the rest of my life and that’s ok. I’m not even going to say maybe one day I can be off the meds because in reality if I have to stay on them I will. Every time I have come off them in the past, I have spiraled and it’s just not worth it. 

Good luck OP. I hope you find some help! 🫶🏻"
Sorry I don't really have advise but I was talking about suicide in year 4 (I live in the UK) and was diagnosed with depression. That led to anxiety and I've just kinda dealt with it. I had no real help as therapy was shit and a family who didn't understand it. I was alone.
In the place I am right now. My hunting cabin.
"Context:  I'm in my early 60s.  I was diagnosed with GAD less than 5 years ago.  I had no idea I had anxiety.

I think my first sign was grinding my teeth as a very young child."
"Within the last 6-8 months it was constant gulping, racing heart, and just feeling nervous/worried in situations where I shouldn’t have been. I guess flight or fight? I would sometimes also feel my eyes get watery. Now I’ve developed to turning or feeling red within the last 4 months I would say and that’s been a struggle."
"Soooo I was raised with incredibly catholic parents. I had anxiety as a child, but was convinced it was because I was a “bad” person and so the devil was trying to take over my body. I would pray the Hail Mary and the Our Father prayer as fast as I could in my head. It would typically work to calm me down. Little did I know it worked because it was a distraction method. 

I was well passed the age of reason before I learned it was anxiety."
Childhood. I’d throw up when traveling- always nervous someone broke in or my fish died while we were gone (even just a couple days) and scared of highway driving. Turned bright red when I got called on jn class. Excessive sweating. Socially nervous and awkward. Always overthinking and worrying.
"My first physical symptom (not my actual thinking my whole life that I never realized until later was severe anxiety disorder) was SWEATING. 

I mean like Kevin Garnett in overtime sweating while sitting in air conditioning in Spanish class."
"Kind of white-knuckled it haphazardly my entire ass backwards life; until I understood what it was. I was in the third grade having anxiety over whether I had my homework finished for that morning. I remember walking to school LITERALLY thinking in my head ""Man, it sucks being a kid. I can't wait till I'm an adult and don't have these kind of problems."" Lmfao."
"I was 5 years old and playing in the bathroom sink with my little sister playing dolls and pretending the sink was a pool, somehow I just stared at my self in the mirror, felt abnormal, and it felt like I couldn’t breath on my own so I started panicking ran to my grandma’s room to tell her I couldn’t breath and crying, they took me to the ER and the nurses told me everything was fine, still felt like I couldn’t breath but I went home and don’t remember what happened after that, I’m 23 now and I still deal with them"
"I think for me it was when I was diagnosed with endometriosis. Having health issues made me very anxious and it’s been like this for almost 5 years now. 
I feel better when I don’t have any health issues but it doesn’t help that anxiety comes with a lot of physical symptoms and i go in a spiral thinking which major disease so I have this week. 

It sounds funny and not so serious to my family but for me it’s very frustrating and draining. Have been trying to manage ever since"
I just remember crying for no reason during soccer practice and my mom took me to the hospital where I got diagnosed with anxiety. I don’t remember what symptoms I had prior to that day
"I couldn’t eat or even barely drink any liquid for about 2 weeks leading up to a full blown panic attack that landed me in ER. I tried to drink water but I would feel nauseous. Looking back, my “stomach issue” was caused by my anxiety, and since then I found out my symptoms are mostly psychosomatic throughout digestive system."
Childhood but no one really understood it was anxiety. I would cry every morning before school because I didn’t want to go and leave my family. I was also very shy/quiet. Then in middle school it got completely unmanageable.
Mine started in first grade. Definite separation anxiety. Didn’t want to leave my mom or my house. Would be really nervous and nauseous. I remember it wasn’t that way every day tho ….. but have had anxiety since then off and on in varying degrees of severity.
Disassociating at the age of 4 but I didn’t know it was due to anxiety till like last year when I connected the dots. I always disassociate when I get a
"Hi, I have anxiety and it was caused by the Covid lockdowns of 2020. It messed with my mind because I felt like a caged animal with no outlet. Everything was so bleak in the news and then all of the stupid rules that made no since. I didn't know I had anxiety until I ended up in the ER. I couldn't breathe, I was dizzy, my chest hurt, I thought I was dying. I was also diagnosed with high blood pressure. When I went to the ER it was 221/116. I am on Losartan and it has been a life saver for me. I also learned how to recognize the signs of my anxiety so if I start to feel it coming on, I do not spin out of control anymore. I was on anxiety meds for about 6 months but weened myself off of them and haven't taken any for 2 years now.

What got me through all of it was just training my mind to not what I like to call go to the dark side. I lived 40+ years without having any anxiety attacks so I knew that I could put it behind me. I still have the occasional flair ups, but I can almost always talk myself off the ledge."
"I remember when it all started, like this weird feeling creeping up on me out of nowhere. At first, I didn't know what it was, but looking back, there were definitely some signs that things weren't right. Here are a few of the symptoms I experienced:

* Constant worry and racing thoughts
* Trouble sleeping or staying asleep
* Feeling restless or on edge all the time
* Muscle tension and headaches
* Upset stomach or digestive issues

It was like my body was on high alert all the time, and no matter what I did, I couldn't shake that sense of unease. It took me a while to realize that what I was feeling wasn't just normal stress – it was something more. That's when I knew I had to reach out for help."
"Always was an anxious kid, but the moment it became unmanageable was in university. It was during the ebola outbreak back then and between the lack of sleep, stress of school, stress of financing and simmering anxiety, it's like the dam broke. Took until last year to get it back to manageable."
"Mine have all been physical symptoms. Dizziness. Rapid heart rate. Muscle tension and pain. Trouble swallowing. I don't even know I have anxiety, it just produces these symptoms. I've gone through every test thinking it was something else. Everything is good. My doctor said it's physical symptoms of anxiety."
I never felt the same after my first panic attack. I had occasional anxiety before but it felt normal
Not being able to breathe properly for almost a week and not understanding what it is till I went to get oxygen and the doctor gave me meds to calm me down instead
I had my first panic attack out of no where and made my boyfriend pull over cause I literally thought I was dying (didn't know what a painic attack felt like so I was extra freaked). That was the day anxiety entered my brain and it's still giving me problems
I think it began with feeling angry and having lots of intrusive thoughts and talking under my breath bad things towards at people when I am in public and I am inside stores with people.
i used to cry as a child before going to anything but when i got there i was fine
I remember being in like 5th grade and swallowing my saliva over and over. I realize now that this was major anxiety. Not being able to sleep due to worries and fears at a young age.
"My social anxiety began when I messed up real bad in school once. Not ab embarrassing moment, if what I did spread then it would truly be over. This was on day of summer break which meant I was anxious the whole time. Got over it in like a year. Then I got really bad health anxiety due to  misinformation about the male penis and skin infection. I had separate bowel problems which I combined with my penis problem and convinced myself I have prostate cancer. Then during corona I was having problem with my sinus which made me feel like I had a fever every morning. Few people in my house got corona and the remaining went to our different house which wasn't as cleaned and I had asthma 24*7 there, even after medication along with feeling feverish every morning which led me to believe I had HIV. And now after 2 years my health anxiety has flared up once again due to interacting with a 2 month old puppy (who was showing no sign of rabies) and getting scratches by it (didn't break skin). Showed my friends, looked at it for hours didn't see any scratch, so didn't tell anyone at home. After 10 days my anxiety started fucking me up, but chance of getting rabies from scratch was low so didn't call doc. After 3 weeks I started feeling symptoms of rabies (after looking it up on google) and called my doc. He said unless it licked me on the wound or smth I wouldn't get rabies. Then after 2 days I was like what if it bit me on the other side of where I felt the scratch and I somehow didn't feel it or see it. Started panicking again so consulted my doc and got rabies vaccine.found out a few days ago that the puppy is still alive but I'm still gonna complete my 5 vaccine course or else my anxiety gonna kill me."
"This was 3 years ago. I remember always having anxiety but around this time was when it started to become a chronic thing. 

I remember having facial tensions and it was like my face and neck were super tight. I also remember having shortness of breath and it was like I went through the entire day feeling I couldn’t breathe properly.

Then it all went to shit afterwards."
"Mine started when I was 8 and had my first anxiety attack. All I can remember is I always thought I was dying and one day it turned into a full on attack. I've been on anti anxiety meds since then (32 now) I do remember being fixated on my breathing and feeling like I couldn't take a deep breath, so I was constantly deep breathing."
"Making myself throw up when my mom would leave me at daycare when I was like 2. (Actually don’t remember this, my mom and aunt told me about it). 

I do remember pacing my daycare and counting in my head thinking if I counted long enough my mom wouldn’t get in a car wreck and die. 

Looking back now, I was an anxious mess before I could even speak in sentences."
"I had a severe panic attack which included breathlessness, dizziness, chest pain and extreme fear of dying. My parents rushed me to the hospital and turned out it was nothing like heart attack just a panic attack.

Since then I had sleepless nights and even failed exams until I found a reliable doctor who prescribed me good meds. I'm doing okay after 5 years now. Meds are my life saviour. 

I still get occasional fear of dying and all but I'm kinda used to shit now."
It began in my puberty. Im 28 now and every year getting worse
"I feel like I’ve always had it, but what’s made me worried was last April I got super sick to the point where I was gagging so I couldn’t eat anything. I googled and found cancer and was worried, a dog bit me last year in America and I googled what rabies was and I haven’t been normal since, I’ve been worried about it, as you can see from my posts it’s like I’ve had a glaring on and off sickness"
"I always had bad social anxiety - in the form of being very nervous, difficulty having conversations, and discomfort around people i was not familiar with. 

When it started getting bad both times, i had these awful physical symptoms that my body convinced me were real. Shortness of breath, dizziness were the worst ones. But the panic attacks resulting from these were so awful too. I am at the point now where it has gotten better and hopefully it continues that way! <3"
I couldn't eat. I loved eating a specific sandwich everyday at school and one day I just couldn't. This was terrifying to me.
"it all started after june 2021 when i never got to hear from my first ex girlfriend ever again.. because of this years later i have devolped bad chest pain, restlesness unable to relax, nausea and constant pain in my stomach like i have drank 20 cups of cofee"
"That flush/warm feeling that hits you like a tsunami out of no where.

Also the pins and needles sensation"
"I had pretty bad paranoia as a child, I always thought someone was following me and out to get me (like 5 years old)..."
"I don't even remember when I started having anxiety disorder. It was my daily routine, as if it had been like that since I was born. God was so harsh on me. Why was he like that?"
When I started school. I was around maybe 5 or 6 when I started to become a quiet child and worry. It was only when I finished school I realised it wasn't just me worrying and being shy.
Idk it was so long ago
"I do not remember. My *first* signs occurred before my memories started to become more permanent... So sometime before I turned 4. I was always a skittish kid. I slept with a light on, I struggled learning to ride a bike, and I hated everything that was even slightly scary.

The first signs that it was going to be a *problem* occurred when I was 8, and really started losing interest in the things I loved. By the time I was 12, every sign that should've been picked up on was missed. I had completely lost interest in the things I loved, my grades had plummeted, and I barely had any friends. I still struggle with a sense of bitterness around that, as every adult in my life failed me at the time. Forgiving those that are partially responsible for my current state of mind hasn't been easy."
mine was about when i was like 8-9 i told my mom i felt like i was going to die
"Since I was a young child. I was afraid people would break into my window, I got nervous ordering things at the counter. Oddly there were scenarios like musical performance where I was okay, but eventually that started to get worse too, and public speaking. 

A lot of it was nurture for me I think, I was raised evangelical and from a young age you are taught about evil, hell and our tendency toward sin. It made me think way too deeply about every decision I was making, who I was, etc. Anxiety 'runs in the family' maternally but I'm convinced it's because they were all raised this way as well, not really genetics per se. 

Advice: Look for a therapist, keep looking until you find one you like. Also, therapy may always make you nervous, this is something you have to accept rather than seeing it as a sign that therapy isn't working. Breathe out for longer than you breathe in -- 4 counts in, 6 counts out. I've found shocks to my system to be really helpful, like taking a hot shower and then turning the water cold at once and trying to tolerate it for a few seconds. Or holding ice for as long as you can stand it (only do this once or twice at a time so you don't get hurt). 

In general, I know that this is a common practice in therapy, but I've found that anxiety can't be reasoned with. You're not going to be able to think yourself out of it. Acceptance is key. Sitting in the discomfort and acknowledging that you have survived anxiety before and you will survive it this time. Knowing that the worst case scenario will not happen, but (in many cases) even if the worst case scenario happened, you would also survive. Think about all of the times where you were really worked up about something and now how little anxiety you feel around it. To me this is more effective than trying to tell yourself that your anxiety is being irrational or getting mad that the anxiety is there. 

These are the principles and skills I come back to. I still have really tough days. 

Also, I recommend that you don't play with any substances or harmful behaviors. From experience, they may help short term, but they will actually hinder your ability to overcome anxiety in the end, because they lower your tolerance to handle anxiety naturally."
"I think I actually remember the exact moment.

I was in 2nd grade, it was recess, I was sitting up against one of the walls of the school building and looking out at all the other kids, and I saw everyone else having fun and just...being normal kids, right?

And that's the moment I knew I was different. Because I wasn't having fun, I wasn't like everyone else in the schoolyard, and I wasn't being punished or anything, I was just genuinely blase about the whole thing.

I didn't have the words to describe it for another 10-15 yrs. When I turned 11, a doctor diagnosed me with clinical depression. When I was 21, a doctor finally told me it was Generalized Anxiety Disorder and that depression was one of the symptoms.

It's kinda crazy going through the first half of your life not even being able to see yourself, knowing there's something different about you and not being able to describe what it is or why. 

You're just building walls around yourself that whole time, and you can't really see or understand core, basic aspects of yourself, so you're inadvertently making it more difficult to break down those walls and really discover yourself when you finally get the tools to do so.

That's why I think it's imperative that we teach kids about mental illness early on, teach acceptance of people with mental illness, so that the stigma attached to it will die off and kids will be able to see themselves a little clearer a little sooner in life and avoid building up walls around themselves.

Like if you have an anxiety disorder like me, and you didn't know about it until later in your life like me, imagine how much of a difference it would have made to you to not only know what it was from an early age, but also be accepted regardless?

It would have been monumental.

It will be monumental.

We just need to DO it."
Months of overthinking.
"I was on a roller coaster that I had been on many times before. I suddenly felt trapped and like I was going to pass out. Didn’t go on any more rides that day coz I was feeling funny, I thought I was ill. Then on the drive home we were stuck in a traffic jam on the motorway and I got the same feelings again. I’ve never been the same since. That was 12 years ago."
"I’ve had intrusive thoughts my entire life. My mother told me I’ve been preoccupied with death since I was a small child, and I remember silly compulsive behaviors like..I gave all of my stuffed animals equal attention so none of them would come to life and kill me in my sleep. I slept with the closet door open bc the monster wouldn’t be there if he didn’t have the element of surprise. Etc. I didn’t recognize that as an element of my anxiety until I got older. My first panic attack as age ~20 happened when I got too high one night (weed) and since then I’ve been a lot more aware of all of my symptoms. So I guess 18 years “officially” but really it’s been there the whole time.


ETA: the best management I’ve found is lifestyle choices. When I’m eating and sleeping well, exercising, making time for socializing, and balancing productivity with R&R, I have gone years at a time without anxiety disrupting my life in any significant way."
"My first signs were waking up dry heaving over the toilet... I went from 0 to 100 in seconds. My anxiety typically stems from thoughts about finances, family, and just general thoughts about bad stuff happening. I was working on something particularly challenging and that set me off. I've been on meds ever since to keep me in check."
"i somehow thought i got melanoma when i was 15 (2018) and then thought i was having a heart attack a week later lol, basically health anxiety , now 6 years later i still deal with it from time to time"
"Age five. I almost died as I went into DKA when I was diagnosed with type one diabetes and in the hospital for a week. I was petrified because I was away from my mom and dad. My mom stayed with me in the hospital. 

Probably have undiagnosed PTSD, but I take Effexor for GAD, which helps me with the panic anyway. I had nightmares and flashbacks most of my childhood. They didn’t stop until I went on medication at 26, I’m 28 now. 

I saw psychiatrists on and off in childhood, but would have to stop because my mom’s insurance only allowed so many visits. 

Meeting with a therapist this week though. I’m ready to start processing and healing!"
"I struggled with it at first when I was little. I had bad nausea and even sometimes diarrhoea. But, my anxiety periods were not frequent. I didn’t have it often. However, the frequent increased by the time, also with life experiences feeding it. I experienced, mild dissociation time to time but, didn’t realise it till growing up and reflected on past. I experienced difficulty of talking and explaining myself, felt as if my brain was shutting down, ruminating, social withdrawal. (Anxiety merged with depression often)
I remember having very very bad nausea and insomnia before an anxiety causing event which got accompanied by seeing creepy daydreams(?) when I shut my eyes and try to sleep. Which got followed by a mental breakdown when I was extremely pressured and triggered for days (I felt like my limits were being searched by my family). Ended up having panic attacks couple years later. Now, I have all kinds of symptoms, feels like as if they’re different every time."
"💫 born this way 💫

but real talk, i didnt understand that my way of thinking and feeling was abnormal until graduating highschool- a teacher sneakily gave me a mental health-kinda packet to make up a credit. I just thought everyone moved through life this way, and beat myself up for not doing as well.

I think it was only like... 5 ish years ago that I learned my high anxiety is probably due to my ADHD. (im 27)"
"I started to have shortness of breath and could feel my heart pounding before triggering situations. Over time I kept overthinking more and more and I started to feel trapped in a cycle. A good therapist and lots of practice with different relaxing/destressing techniques helped me a lot (drink hot tea or something really cold, affirmations, etc). I also listened to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks on stoicism to try to focus on what I can control and letting go of worrying about the rest."
Diarrhea.
"As some other users have said, to me, anxiety works more like a gradient; it builds up, so it is hard to pinpoint a specific event/sign, but these are some which I've learned to watch closely:

\- Nail biting. I've done this my whole life, but when it really gets out of control (which I'm usually unaware of) I try to be on the watch.

\- Needing more-than-usual help to fall asleep: pills, TV on, you name it. Or simply not wanting to ho to sleep for whatever reason. In contrast, when my anxiety levels are low, I can easily connect with the need/want to sleep.

\- Not being able to concentrate on a single task for more than 10 minutes or so.

\- For some reason I gain weight when I'm anxious. It could be that I eat more, that there's some hormonal process going on, or both. I don't know, but it happens. With pills, this became more evident.

I'm sure you might've heard this too many times but there's no need to deal with unbearable situations; meds are challenging for some (for different reasons) but they help A TON. Hope you find peace in your mind soon."
Panic attacks -> generalised anxiety -> social anxiety that I’m currently dealing for around 1.5 years…. Really sucks…..
"Panic attacks at 12 years old. I haven’t had a panic attack since I was like 21 (I’m 23 now), but I still feel the intense anxiety. One of my goals is to get medicated like I was before"
"Well, the past years I culdn't sleep at all. I started to realise that even the small things in my everyday life were making me anxious, for example making a phone call or order food.

Then, I could't sleep. When I turned off the lights, my mind began runnning fast, and my impulsive thoughts were imbarebale. Like for example, I was thinking how I would react on someone's death or if someome yelled at me. 

Finally, after many talks wth my therapist, I conducted a psychiatrist and I am on medication. I feel way better and secure, although I know that I won't be on medicaion forever, but at least for now, I'm better."
"I was 6 and lost my teeth due to some simple child activities, like running and falling down. After the surgery I started being anxious about my health (I kept on asking my mom if my teeth are fine and in place, like a few times per day per MONTHS). Also we lived in a really really old building and I was afraid that it will collapse or got on fire.
When I was 13 and had to give a public speech at school. Suddenly I started shaking so hard that I couldn’t keep in hands my notes from which I was reading. It was a first time in my life and I didn’t now what was going on. My friend had to go out on the stage to help me and keep in front of my eyes the notes to let me keep reading. All teenage audience stared laughing from me till the end of the speech. Since that day I struggle additionally with social anxiety, public speaking.
Around that age my grandmother died from heart attack and my mom was diagnosed with cancer. She died 10 years later. It strongly empathised my health anxiety. 

Now as an adult I know that most of my fears are irrational, but I cannot cope with the automatic responses of my body. Like high heart right, dizziness, shaking… 

For me it started at 6 and now I am soon 28."
"I've had anxiety and depression for basically my entire life, I wouldn't be able to pinpoint the when, what's or how's. I can think of many events that trigger it, but not the ""starting point."""
"I think Ive always been aprehensive and used to tend to worry a lot but im sure covid triggered this on me , i started with mild dizziness and obsessive thinking aswell"
"I've had anxiety since childhood, but always manageable (I had bad depression though), until just before COVID when I started getting panic attacks. That quickly morphed into health anxiety with COVID and lockdowns, and now I hyperfixate on different illnesses I (don't) have.  At least I don't get panic attacks anymore."
The earliest memories I have were pre school and kindergarten I felt so isolated back then I used to wet my pants because I was afraid to ask to use the bathroom. Didn’t realize anxiety was a thing until around age 17. Therapy and recently starting meds have helped a lot also journaling has been great for me this past year.
i heard my parents arguing thorough the walls from my mom’s uterus
Pre-kindergarten
Had a horrible fear of dying when I was like 4-5years old. Natural disasters too. Would full on have panic attacks and couldn’t swallow food
"I was 13 and I kept having obsessive thoughts that turned into OCD. I struggled with that for about five years and then developed major depression which then, turned into bipolar disorder. I was never put on medicine for anxiety. 

The compulsions eventually went away but I struggled with depression significantly in my 20s. The anxiety came back too but this time it was more extreme perfectionism, caring too much about what other people think, and worrying about irrational things. 

I’m 30 now. Have been through three psychiatrists and four therapists. I’ve been taking Lexapro for a couple months now and it’s great for treating the anxiety. It’s not a magical pill since there are some side effects but it helps tremendously. 

My main regret is not starting medication years ago. It’s changed my life. Typically, anxiety is not manageable without medicine. If it’s severe enough to cause significant distress and disruption in your life, you most likely could benefit from medication."
My first sign of anxiety was in elementary school when I went through an intense case of separation anxiety. Over time my anxiety has manifested differently as I’ve gotten older
"After 10-11 when my dad unexpectedly died…would go thru periods without any , and then major periods … started college a year early at 16…as well as first job… would get so anxious I couldn’t take finals..then period where I was pretty good.. fast forward to having child at 30… major major anxiety, more family deaths, job loss, divorce after 10 yrs… anxiety has been nonstop since…it sucks!"
I was out to eat at a restaurant and as we were leaving I pictured something bad happening to my boyfriend and threw up all my food in the parking lot. Haven't been the same since!
"Lightheadedness, a fear of passing out, feeling like I'm not there. Slowly became derealization. Can't shake it."
"First signs were definitely as a child. Always worrying. Thinking I had this or that sickness. Thinking the worst basically. I took meds in my late twenties early thirties but weened myself off. Anxiety has been off the rails lately. I was at work yesterday and felt a little off balance. Then it all hit me. I felt overwhelmed, scared, dizzy. It was like I just wanted to get out of there I felt embarrassed like what if I pass out in front of all these people. Whenever I get a bad attack like that I feel off balance for days following. Then here comes the wild thoughts of everything I could possibly have. Googling symptoms every time my body feels anything. It’s debilitating. I don’t know if therapy will help. I just feel lost. It’s bad enough to have anxiety but when you start to feel physical symptoms it’s the worst."
When i kept sighing and took very very deep breaths (like really trying to fill my lungs with enough air) at the age of 7ish?
"I don't remember, I had a bad childhood so I'm guessing it started when I was 3-5 but I have no idea really."
"I was probably just born with it, I don't really have any childhood memory where that general feeling of unease was not present. It's kinda funny, but I think my very first memory is of me planning escape routes in the event of a fire to keep myself, my mom, and my favorite stuffies safe (less than 4 years old likely). Definitely not normal child behavior!

I'm childfree and like to joke a bit that, even as a kid, I had too much social anxiety to enjoy the company of other very loud and socially unaware children. Aside from a singular outburst as a 2-year-old, I never acted out in public, that would be embarrassing! Kids these days just need more internalized shame /s"
"yeah i remember always being different? when i was a kid but i realize now that was just my anxiety and me being a child could not manage it so i would freak out 

i don’t remember the symptoms just insanely embarrassing events that make so much sense now knowing it was awful anxiety"
"When I done CBT for social anxiety the therapist asked me when my first symptoms of anxiety started and I said I never remember not having anxiety (the CBT also did not work) fast forward a couple of years later and I got diagnosed with autism. 
I think most people without neurological issues seem to have a starting point to their anxiety, or remember something that triggered it"
"Me too. But, I kinda remembered the events and situations fed it. I remember having social anxiety all of a sudden when I was a kid. I was a confident and outgoing kid so, I was even shocked by myself. I remember thinking ”I don’t know why I cannot do it but, I cannot, I am shy and I don’t know why!”  
Also, I remember experiencing panic because of silly very harmless ‘we got lost’ jokes of my parents. But, everyone experiences anxiety time to time. It’s a problem when it becomes continuous, life-interfering and when it is an anxiety disorder."
"Not even kidding my exact experience. I had a panic attack in october and it’s been crazy for me. I’m starting meds soon, then getting off, my therapist and I made a plan to feel what its like not anxious, then get off the meds and work toward that"
"The past few months have been debilitating for me. I will probably get about 3 or 4 slightly manageable days but that’s it. I’ve been trying my hardest to “do the work”. I started therapy last week and I felt better afterwards but the thought of waiting another week to get another chance at feeling some form of relief is not making things better. I’ve started journaling and meditating recently as well. I’ve watched YouTube videos learning more about the illness. I’ve gotten my bloodwork and currently working on my vitamin deficiencies. I’m just hoping if I talk about it more, I can learn to live with it."
Same here. Had a PA in July and I've been searching for answers since. Been on Lexapro for 7 weeks and it's not going particularly well. If things don't improve soon I'm going to start tapering off and see if they can just give me something for blood pressure to protect my body to some degree while I work through this. I can take the suffering and work but I don't want to blow an oring somewhere.
"I’ve surpassed the spiraling stage. In my head, everything was going to magically go away. Now I’ve reached a point where I need as much help as possible to deal with this."
"i remember as a child i wouldn’t usually throw up because of unfamiliar places, i think once or twice i have but usually my stomach would hurt so bad to the point where i felt like i was. i still don’t know to this day, if i had/have anxiety or if i was just nervous but it still happeneds to me to this day and i have no idea what it is, but i overthink a lot so i think im just a very nervous person😭"
I’m sorry you had to go through those things at such a young age. I hope everything is better and more manageable for you now.
That’s awful I’m so sorry as well you went through that
I have been prescribed about 3 different antidepressants and the bottles stare at me every day. I am terrified of taking them.
Omg! That sounds so scary. Physical symptoms are the worst
I will never forget standing up in 10th grade to read something and my hands shook uncontrollably.  It surprised me. Since then I just expect it to happen.
How are you managing it now?
These comments are making me realize I’ve been living with anxiety my entire life. Because same! I would literally run to my room and lock the door once I learned we were having company.
Whew! Do you know how long you went undiagnosed?
"Same! I will get wave of heat throughout my body and then my heart will start pounding and then a rush of anxiety. I try my best to practice breath work to get me through it but most times, that isn’t enough"
I realized yesterday (as I was watching YouTube videos on anxiety) that I’ve been dealing with anxiety for much longer than I realize. I would literally skip classes in college to avoid doing presentations. I would feel my heart pounding even at the thought of having to speak in front of my peers. I now know that is social anxiety and did not realize it then. I am so glad that I am finally getting help.
Thank you so much for this. I am terrified of trying medication… anxious about anxiety medication 😭 so ironic. I’ve read so many horror stories that I’m afraid. But I know it’s something I have to do
Oh no! I’m so sorry you had to experience that alone. I know you are older now but I hope that you are in a much better place mentally and you are able to get help when you’re feeling low.
Do you have any other symptoms now?
Praying you weren’t an alter boy
I would rather drive 3 hours through back roads than to drive 10 minutes on the highway 😭
I was yesterday years old when I realized I’ve been dealing with this my entire life and was diagnosed at 28
Lmao and look at us now… adulting with the same problems 🤣🤣
Are you currently on any medication for it?
"Yes!!! My family and friends laugh every time I mention a different illness or disease I may possibly have. They really don’t understand how our brains are trying to rationalize each and every symptom we face.  It’s so hard to manage. If I notice any signs of sickness, I go into an immediate panic"
I’ve been focusing on my gut health after learning that anxiety and gut health are connected.
i would also do this but resulted to being fake ill most the time😭
Losartan was hell for me. I was on the smallest dosage as my blood pressure was slightly elevated. I think I took it for about 5 days and that’s when my anxiety and depression became so extreme and I couldn’t understand why. I looked up the reviews on drugs.com and realized Losartan had to have been the culprit and I stopped taking it immediately.
"This is exactly how it happened for me. Now, I look back and realize I’ve been showing signs my entire life. Are you taking medication? What are some things you would recommend?"
Same! I went as far as getting a full body mri. I was convinced I was dying of an undiagnosed disease. Health anxiety is no fun.
I was able to manage my anxiety for months. But then I started to get panic attacks and intrusive thoughts and that’s when I realized I could no longer do this alone.
Are you still on the meds?
same! out of no where i had a panic attack then days later just non stop tension in my forehead area and neck and shoulder pain this was in july and to this day i have they same tension but it moves all over my head like i can’t just relax my head along with crazy headaches! i had an MRI back in july and it was clear but still at this moment my head won’t relax or stop hurting idk
What do you think caused the fear that lead to panic attacks?
"I'm sorry that sucks. I had the same type of stuff happen too. I remember talking in front of class and it was extremely hard for me to do it. I stuttered pretty bad or didn't make sense. Then I would take tests and sweat so much my hand would leave an imprint on my paper. It was mentally exhausting. I had to get on medication, then I stopped (thinking everything was okay), then eventually had to get back on it. I feel a lot better now but I get everyone is different. 

I'm constantly worried about my house, finances, my job, it just sucks. My dad just had bladder cancer and my grandfather died from lung cancer. I quit smoking weed, nicotine and drinking alcohol like 3 months ago and I feel my anxiety skyrocketed when I did all that lol. 

You're not alone!"
"omg relatable. Im convinced my mothers own onset of mental illness contributed to my being born with it. Stress transferred in the womb, as well as a childhood with an anxious parent.

I also asked my mom what i was like as a kid and she'd said i was ""very well behaved"" ; alsl vaguely remember being told often how mature i was for my age at like- 8 yrs old 🙃💀"
"It’s been awful, I’m sorry you’re dealing with it as well. I would like to not have to rely on meds forever either, but I’ll do anything to get rid of this feeling right now. Good luck!"
Check out Therapy in a Nutshell on YouTube. Excellent resource.
"You’re doing all the things, and that’s all we can do! I completely understand the frustration and impatience of wanting it to be done and back to normal NOW. I’ve also started meditating and find journaling helpful. I have also found Reddit super helpful during this time, it helps to know that other people go through the same things you’re going through. I hope you’re able to get some relief soon ❤️"
"I’m sorry, I hope you find something that works. The thought of tapering and trying to find something else is exhausting. I hope the Lexapro starts to work."
"I’m sorry you’re going through it, it’s rough! I feel like anxiety is downplayed so much, but the physical toll it can take on your body at times is not fun. It’s like you quite literally have to work against what your brain is trying to convince you is true"
"It's not magic, but the symptoms though scary, also confirm your body is working PROPERLY! The hang up is your brain is sending the signal at the wrong time. So don't think you're screwed up, treat it as your brain just getting its timing wrong. Then you can understand it a little better and it won't seem so illogical. Anxiety is a big mind fuck. A game that your brain takes on your consciousness, and one tries to out arm wrestle the other. 🙂"
"Thank you, very much so."
Oh the irony of being anxious about taking something to treat your anxiety 😆 ...been there
"Yes, ""uncontrollably."" I hated when we had to give a verbal report in front of the class. When I got married, just my husband and I went to Las Vegas and got married by a JP. A rubber stamp signature was the witness. There is no way I was having a wedding with people looking at me."
Honestly getting my heart rate up for 30 minutes everyday. Vitamin D with breakfast and Magnesium with dinner. If things get unbearable I do have a prescription for 20 mg of hydroxyzine but I really try not to take that anymore because it kills my sex life and knocks me out for a good 15 hours.
Until my early twenties when I could get an actual diagnosis and not be told I was just making it up. It’s been tough.
I haven’t tried the breathing technique but I do try to talk myself into calming down
"oh fuck yeah.

I think I had my first panic attack Thursday night.  1\*  Would not recommend.

psychiatrist diagnosed with GAD"
"Actually, no, but only cause girls weren’t allowed yet. Yup, I’m old ;)"
SAME!
*forgets grown-up homework*
I have been raw dodging panic attacks and anxiety for years
Everyone is different
"This is something I would do Dx A full body MRI sounds like heaven to my health anxiety. Checking EVERYTHING. Its awful, every single pain or body sensation makes you worry you have the worst case of something even if it’s just anxiety itsself manifesting or a treatable infection. There’s some health anxiety podcast and videos I’ve been referred to from others I need to check out. Heard it helps bring you back down to earth and overall eases your mind."
"That's the same. I've had MRI's, CT Scans with and without contrast, a cone beam scan of my head, ultrasounds... 🤦‍♀️ if you don't mind me asking what are your most common symptoms? 

I am so sorry you're dealing with all this too! It's absolutely no fun at all. I have no good advice as I am trying to navigate it myself but knowing I'm not alone makes me feel more sane about it!"
No it was a few days treatment but sometimes I feel suffocated again it comes and goes I don't take any meds now
"That’s awful to hear. I’m sorry you’re going through this, this might take some time to adjust is all I could say. 

But the brutal truth, you’re going to have to learn not to care about your anxiety that’s all it is, anxiety. When you show it that you’re not plagued by it it will go away. This is easier said than done but the more you practice, it will drastically improve."
Yeah:( Thanks! Good luck to you as well
Checking it out now. Thank you
Thank you so much. I hope the same for you. I’m so glad I’ve found Reddit. It’s been so helpful
I’ve been taking magnesium and thiamine at night for about a week. I have not noticed any positive effects yet but it’s only been a week so I’m hanging in there lol
I’m sorry you had to go so long without getting the help you’re deserved. I’m glad you are in a position to get help now.
The panic attacks are the absolute worst. The anxiety was more manageable for me until the panic attacks began.
Literally 🤣🤣 it’s never ending
Me too. Sucks so bad.
"Exactly! And if I read up on said infection/disease, I will literally start feeling every freaking symptom associated with that disease. It’s a never ending battle. 

Please let me know what videos others recommended. I watched a few random videos on YouTube yesterday and took a lot of notes. They were really helpful."
"Everything you listed and more. I have more physical symptoms than anything. Dizziness, heart palpitations, pins and needles, muscle pains, body aches, twitches… OMG the muscle twitches throughout my body especially my eyes are horrible, rapid heart rate, headaches, honestly the list goes on.   

You are not alone in this. WE will figure this out. I am so grateful for Reddit."
The DARE podcast is good too.
The magnesium I honestly didn’t notice a big difference for like two months or so on the magnesium. I’ve also been drinking like a half cup to a cup of kefir in the morning so I can get some probiotics and I think it’s helped my gut health ALOT.
"Yes!! If I find it I will send link in reply to this. If there was a magical cure for HA, it would feel too good to be true because that is basically the root to my tree of anxiety. We aren’t alone though, I love this community for that reason. Calms me down so much. <3"
"Oh wow! I also had pins & needles, on my face and arms especially! Painful muscle spasms, twitches (especially my eyes), I had heart palpitations the first time the other day so thats new for me. It sounds like we are literally going through the same thing! I can be looking at the TV scolling to watch something and feel dizzy & off and then it starts a chain reaction of symptoms! 

You aren't alone either, we will make it through this somehow! I am so glad we crossed paths. I feel way more at ease knowing I'm not the only one out here and that this is in fact not me dying from a rare disease 😅 I have googled so many things from all this, that I firmly believed I had all these rare diseases.. it's crazy how anxiety can work. But my daughter has Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures from anxiety (anxiety caused by trauma) and those are very real and cannot be controlled by medications. Just goes to show how much anxiety can affect you. It still blows my mind! 

Im here for you!"
"Your dizzines haa been like constant  or only somtimes? Bcs for months after very bad anxiety mine has been constant , even that i have done manyyy mri s this months , i feel calm just 2 days afteer mri and starts again"
"I started drinking kombucha, changed my diet and taking more vitamins. Hopefully if I stick to a routine, the anxiety will be more manageable. That is my main goal as of now. I’m glad you’ve figured out what works for you."
It’s almost like reading a comment about myself lol. I hate that we’re both experiencing this but I’m so glad we’re not in it alone. For months I couldn’t understand what was happening with my body until I found Reddit. I’m so grateful for all of you
"It depends on the day, I've had days where the dizziness is throughout the whole day and somedays where the dizziness happens once or even not at all and I'm good. Find something that can keep your attention so you don't think about it. And then when you're done think back to if you had any dizziness while you were occupied. That tells you a lot. When we hyper-fixate on it, it seems to stick around."
I totally get it! We drive ourselves crazy with trying to figure out what's wrong because its out of the norm! I have learned more from reddit than Google. I'm grateful as well!
What the doctors says?
My doctor said it was anxiety. As much as I don't want to accept that answer.
