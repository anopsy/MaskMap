"Essentially it is masking your autistic traits in order to fit in. It is very prevalent with older autistic people like myself who were never diagnosed at a young age. For me it involved studying lots of old movies so I could match what people said to their facial expressions ( old movies were good for that as they overemphasized they’re facial expressions). It involved practicing what I was going to say for every conceivable interaction with other people. It’s all in an attempt to outwardly appear “normal”. I though for the longest time I thought that everyone was like me but just better at being human. 

The big problem with masking is that it takes a great deal of effort and concentration and leads to burnout. Sometime to the point of going non verbal. It also leads to depression and other nasty mental illnesses like anxiety disorders."
"Autistic people behave in certain ways that are obvious to non-autistic people as autistic, or at least not ""normal"". 

Lots of neurotypical people don't react well if you behave in a way that's obviously autistic, so lots of autistic people learn to mask: which is when you force yourself to act in ways that people expect you to. Do things that don't come naturally to you but do come naturally to autistic people.

It varies a lot depending on the individual, but common examples are:

\- Forcing facial expressions that don't come naturally because people think you don't feel anything otherwise

\- Forcing yourself to stay still when you'd rather be stimming

\- Talking in ways that neurotypical people expect you to talk. Like saying ""how are you?"" when you don't actually care, feigning interest in people's hobbies and not just talking about your own interests, that kind of thing. 

\- Maintaining eye contact even though it makes you uncomfortable.

It's exhausting because you need to be pretty much actively doing it the whole time during conversation. But it can also be troublesome if, like me, you're no good at doing it, so people can usually work out pretty quickly that you're autistic."
"Neurotypical people tend to be uncomfortable around some people with autism when their traits are obvious, in order to fit in people will attempt to mask these traits so as to pass as a neurotypical person."
"You know how you put a high-powered graphics card in a computer, and you can play AAA games at full frame rates with no glitches? That’s because the card supplies hardware acceleration for graphics. It’s specifically designed to be really good and really fast at specialized, complicated calculations needed to render smooth, high-quality video.

Most people’s brains have “hardware acceleration” for social interactions. They know instantly, without thinking about it, what people’s facial expressions and body language mean, how their tone of voice sounds to other people, and so on. Autistic people lack that. It’s like running on integrated graphics. The CPU has to do everything... and man, does it get hot!

“Masking” is pushing that CPU full-throttle — still dropping frames, tearing, reducing quality — trying to keep up with a game that was meant to run on different hardware, and trying not to let anybody notice."
"Basically it's when someone who is autistic suppresses their autistic traits (not always possible and occasionally painful) to try to appear """"""normal""""""

Happens with ADHD folks too, can say from experience"
You ever have to go somewhere you hate but know it would be impolite to wear said annoyance around so you put on a happy face and pretend to be fine. It's that but for autistic symptoms. If you've worked retail customer service face is the same basic concept.
"A little anecdote about masking: I took the Meyers Briggs personality test once. I ended up getting a result completely different from what I expected. I realized that the test had asked me what I would do in a given situation, but that it didn't distinguish between what I would **WANT** to do, and what I would **CHOOSE** do. Essentially my natural behaviours, and those I had learned by masking were at odds.

Its quite similar to stage acting actually. Except that your role is a persona you have to have on all the time. I guess its something movie-stars deal with too."
"Some people have difficulties understanding social interactions. They need to see what other people do and try to imitate it. It's like being born without an instruction manual for social interactions, and having to create one from scratch through observation."
"Autistic masking, or camouflaging, is when someone with autism tries to hide or suppress their autistic traits in social situations. They might imitate behaviors that are considered ""normal"" or hide repetitive movements or behaviors that are typical for them. It's like putting on a mask to fit in and avoid standing out. However, masking can be really tiring and stressful for people with autism because they have to constantly monitor and control their natural tendencies. It can make it harder for them to express themselves and may affect their overall well-being."
"It's a series of behaviors meant to mask the otherness of being autistic, usually in an attempt to fit in or avoid discrimination.

For instance, I tend to make vastly different assumptions while I speak or write, combined with the inclusion of sound effects and rhythmic patterns,  plus the rarity of finding topics distasteful, means that my natural mode of talking is strange and annoying to most people. I also cry a lot whenever I talk about anything and get absorbed in the conversation, which disrupts the conversation with people asking if I'm okay, and putting people off with my sniffling. As a result, I mask my natural speaking voice by adopting a higher pitch, and adopting a detached and technical speech style. This prevents the weird speaking habits, and (usually) prevents me from getting too worked up about the topic of discussion.

It's not perfect, and causes its own problems, but it's often better than the alternative."
"Normal people will intuitively have a normal conversation, make normal facial expressions, laugh at normal times, get a normal amount of excited over normal topics.  
  
I (autistic) will have a conversation and will do all the same things, but only after years of intentional studying and copying how other people act.  
  
It is not intuitive.It is difficult, stressful, and exhausting. But because I've been doing it for years, it has become the usual way I interact with other people, so much so that I have lost touch with my own personality.  
That's masking.  
  
And the catch is that even when I'm masking as best as I can, other people notice that something is off about me and will often just say I'm weird or creepy or my ""vibe is off""."
"As an analogy, imagine learning handwriting. For most people, it becomes muscle memory. When writing a ""T"" for example, you can do it without even thinking about the structure and telling yourself ""okay, first draw the horizontal line at the top, then, from its center, draw a vertical line to the bottom"". Maybe the first couple of times you do have to do that, but now when you write a ""T"" your body just *does* it without you thinking about the shape.

Now suppose that, for some reason, you just *can't* get this through muscle memory. Every single time you write a ""T"", you have to think ""ok horizontal line, then vertical line from the center down"". But the more you do it, the faster you're able to go through this thought process, and the better you do it. Almost to the point that you're looking as proficient at handwriting as any normal person. However, unlike a normal person, who is doing it via muscle memory without thinking, you are thinking about the shape of every letter you write. Therefore, even though you can pass yourself off as a normal writer, you can't keep it up as long because it is *far* more exhausting for you. Thinking of the shape of every letter is a major cognitive load that normal hand-writers don't have to worry about.

This is what autistic people go through, but instead of handwriting, it's reading and displaying social cues. Things such as understanding people's facial expressions and inferring their emotions from it, displaying your own facial expressions to express your feelings, understanding when you're reaching somebody's boundary of comfort from the tone of their voice, etc. This is something that neurotypical people learn to do by ""muscle memory"", and they don't have to think about it. But autistic people *always* have to think about it. We get better and better at doing it as we live and interact with more people. But it will *always* require cognitive effort, it will never be ""muscle memory"". 

That's what ""masking"" is. Looking like we're as good at reading and responding to social cues as normal people, because we get more and more proficient at doing the mental exercise. But we can still never keep it up as long as normal people because it will never be automatic for us, it will always require conscious effort."

"It's basically expending effort & focus to appear ""normal"". People are assholes. It's socially easier to play pretend so people don't notice

You know those memes about ""now you're breathing manually""? Imagine that, but for every social behaviour you exhibit. It also involves consciously suppressing the ""undesirable"" things that people find annoying. 

It's exhausting, and can reinforce feelings of social isolation due to the fact you're basically talking through a social glass screen; the alien pretending to fit in"
"For those who were diagnosed later in life, did you have children & did your children have autism or were they on the spectrum at all?"
"When we try to act normal to avoid being seen as “low functioning” or “weird”. Though I have absolutely no idea how to mask so I end up looking 9, even tho I’m nearly 16"
"I'm fairly sure I have very high functioning autism. Never diagnosed, but it would explain SO MUCH of my behaviors, ticks, and way of thinking. Should I get myself tested? Is there any benefit to getting diagnosed? Or should I just continue as I am?"
"You don’t practice making expressions in the mirror?

Everyone masks.  Those that do so more naturally or without conscious effort are deemed neurotypical."
"When I’m around people, I make myself act like them. I have a persona that is an amalgamation of everything that’s socially acceptable. I have to tone down or completely “mask” my reactions to things.

Since my intense and unfiltered reactions to some things are weird or annoying (I audibly gag at some textures and stim a lot physically), I hide them because people treat me differently when I’m not masking around them.

I’m able to be around close friends and family without hiding my neurodivergent traits, but with most people I suppress myself, and that takes so much effort."
"It's living in hell, all your life. It's pretending to be someone you're not in an attempt to survive and succeed, even if what you're doing goes against everything your body/mind is telling you to do.

Think of a neurotypical person and their typical social motions: looking people in the face, understanding social cues, being relatively comfortable with common things like going to the store or perhaps some other social gathering (let's not even get into large gatherings and tons of noise/lights/smells), understanding and being able to identify or regulate your emotions, not being highly sensitive to one or more primary senses (sound, temperature, light, odor, etc.).... the list goes on.

Now take those things and make it so the social norm is the exact opposite, and in order to survive or succeed you have to learn how to do these things, but you don't really learn them and understand them, it's more that you've memorized the steps to the dance and have practiced and practiced until you can get it right even though it's not genuine.

Now take that scenario and make the neurotypical world the default, and autists have to figure out hownto live in that world. That is autistic masking. It's pure hell every day and it causes a ton of depression, anxiety, and other things. Medicine can take the edge off, but that's it."
"ELI5: make an effort to appear normal.

It is masking your condition to blend with neurotypical people. It usually consumes a lot more resources than neurotypicals can imagine and causes a lot of mental fatigue"
"It is when someone who has autism has to act like they don't have autism, to fit in with people who don't have autism.

Often it is just societal bullshit, especially when the autism is merely mild autism, or ""high functioning"" autism. Society should simply accept those people as they are, instead of them feeling that they should have to mask.

Fuck most of society and fuck the people that cause people with autism to have to mask."

I've described it as suppressing the urge to stick my head under the chocolate fondue fountain because I know it's socially unacceptable but still wanting to very badly
"Autistic guy here, ive known that people maso but i havent that much, whenever i mask, its because i dont want to be chastised at school, a public place, etc. Although recently ive been trying not to since i feel more free. Basically it comes down to this in the simplest terms
A ""defense mechanism"" that ensures you arent socially chastised and called out in public"
"I'm glad you explained that so well. I have friends that are going through some of the same things...it took a minute for me to catch on...getting close to someone that has autistic mannerisms, well you pick up on it if you really pay attention to them. I felt as if I was violating something private by asking but was relieved to find out that they were so open about it and relieved to have someone else they could be honest and really themselves with...one of my dearest friends..."
"Avoiding tasks and stuff that could possibly expose you -  and it makes it worse because I get a little a anxious and overwhelmed trying and doing new things and even though I have good intentions everything always , always go wrong.

I've always been the type to want to do something last, or do it alone in the middle of the night so no fear of judgement. I would wake up in the middle of the night to do my homework at like 2 or 3 am because I hated doing it in front of my family. My mom would try to help but never be able to answer the questions I had and it made me so upset that I would never truly understand anything I'm doing . (ADHD/possible)"
"As children, our behaviours are constantly corrected to be ""neurotypical"" behaviours - which really means, the behaviours that society has decided are acceptable and which come more naturally to people who are not autistic. 

We learn very quickly that only a neurotypical presentation is ""acceptable"" and if we want to stay out of trouble, make friends, get and keep jobs eventually, we have to pretend to be neurotypical.

Imagine being an actor, on stage all day long, constantly trying to remember the ""right"" lines, and facial expressions to make in every scene, constantly judging whether you got it right. That would be really exhausting wouldn't it?

And that is how we live when we mask. Permanently exhausted, and that's before you add on sensory stimulation and all the others things that eat away at our fabric.

I was diagnosed aged 43, and masking is still the most damaging thing I do to myself."
"Imagine a robot who looks just like a human. Now imagine them doing robot stuff. That's natural for them but wierd for you. 

Now imagine being a robot trying to pretend to be a human and blend in, it's not natural. They may get good at it and or they may be terrible at it, you might notice something off about them, but either way it's mentally exhausting and takes a toll on them to analyse and second-guess the correct way to move and behave.

This is just an analogy but I guess some autistic people won't be happy being called robots. Ive been called a terminator in the past but I'm not bothered by it."
"Could someone ELI5 how this differs (neurologically, and in other ways) from using social judgment? For example, I may feel an impulse to interrupt my colleague, but I make the decision not to; or I want to roll my eyes at something someone said, but I decide not to out of politeness. My burning truth may be that I still hate my colleague or want to roll my eyes, but I suppress it to keep the peace or to keep a strategic advantage. Is the NT/ND difference in how much energy or resources it requires to conceal these real reactions?"
