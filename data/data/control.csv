"**20/40/60 rule**

When you're 20, you care what everyone thinks of you.

When you're 40, you *don't* care what anyone thinks of you.

When you're 60, you realize *no one was thinking of you at all,* it was just in your head."
Listening is much more important than speaking.
"You can't save someone who isn't actively trying to save themself. In other words, there are some people who thrive on drama and chaos, and only want to bring you into it. Walk away. They'll be fine and you'll be far better off."
"At the end of the day, after all is said and done, I assure you that you are on your own."
Every one is your brother or sister. Treat them that way.
"* What others think of you is none of your business.

* Forgiving is giving up hope for a better past.

* The best revenge is living a happy life.

* Naps are great.

* There is always time for another last minute."
"Believe people when they show you who they are. 

Don't overlook red flags because you ""want to see their good side"".

Invest early and for the long term."
Get into good eating and exercise habits when you're young and those habits will keep you healthy when you're older.
"People will believe all types of crazy stuff but you don't have to too.  When something seems too good to be true it usually is, except for vaccines and antibiotics."
"Change is the only constant of the universe. No matter how comfortable or content you are, or no matter how miserable you are, everything changes sooner or later. Adapting to change is critical, and the resultant change becomes your new reality. 

Everyone, everything living dies.   

You aren’t in control no matter how much you think you are.  Accidents happen. Shit happens.  People you depend on and love die unexpectedly.  Your employment and/or clients can disappear overnight through circumstances beyond your control.  Catastrophes happen and not only to other people.  So much occurs that is beyond anticipating, and your only recourse is to adapt to the new reality.   

It costs you NOTHING to be kind, accepting, affirmative to people and it can make others’ lives, and your own life, worth living.  On the reverse, you waste time and energy worrying about what other people may think of you — which means you are effectively living in their imagination.  What’s the point of that?  

Relationships are more important than conflicts about politics, religion, ideologies, work, possessions, money — anything.  There’s no law that says you have to engage in any discussion.  Withdrawal can be a sign of maturity since it’s almost absolute that no one will change their mind about long-held positions.   

Relationships are more important than work.  Yes, you need to uphold your responsibilities, but never at the cost of relationships.   

As early as you can, get in shape and stay in shape through a sensible lifestyle and low-impact, regular physical activity that you can learn to love and look forward to.  It makes a huge difference as you age.   

You’re more than a brain within a living organism - you have a spiritual side, too. Get in touch with it in some manner.  It’s a natural, human drive.  Art, beauty, nature, music, people — all can trigger a spiritual response within you.  Find a way to embrace it."
"Use your legs, stay active."
"Bruno's Lessons

I'm not the center of anyone's universe but my own.

Don't shit on other people's parades.

Don't chase women; they are faster than me.

Sub-lesson: Make common cause with women, they see and know shit you don't.

Learn everything that comes your way.

Love the HELL out of something...or MANY somethings.

Physically exert yourself to exhaustion three times per week.

Sit and be quiet...again, about three times per week.

Be part of something bigger than yourself.

Talk less...listen more.

Take the long view of everything."
"Don't put up with abusive behavior.  It's not normal.  It will never change.  

Start saving early so you can retire comfortably.  Every little bit counts."
If you drag your feet a little before putting weight on them you can find glass and nails before they go through your foot.
Everything is temporary.
"Nothing tastes as good as being fit and healthy feels.

Take care of your body - it will have problems and wear out, and living in constant chronic pain is no fun."
"The people you choose to be with can have a huge impact in your life. 

I can't tell you how many times I was with friends, just minding my own business and then we are suddenly fighting strangers or find ourselves at a police station. My husband and his family have impacted my life much more than I expected. 

Choose friends and partners wisely."
"We have a lot less control over our lives than we like to think we do.  You can do everything 'right' and still fail, you can wing it and succeed.  You can eat right and exercise, not drink or smoke, and still drop down dead of a heart attack in your 30s.  Things will happen that you never even saw coming, people you have never heard of will make decisions that will have an impact on your life (and it's not personal, they've never heard of you either).  You don't, and no one ever will, get what you deserve in life.  

There is little point in worrying, because worry always ends.  Either the thing you are worried about won't happen and the worry will end, or the thing you are worried about will happen and you will deal with it and the worry will end, or you will die and will never worry again.  Of course, that is much easier said than done, but it helps to bear that in mind when the worries come."
"How to not get sucked down by regret.

"... listens more than one talks ... actively listen to others and hear less of oneself.

... family is first, last, and always!

and finally, early in your life, do listen to the adults who kept telling you to eat right, sleep well, and take care of yourself.  Later in life, sometimes it is very difficult to reverse the damages that have been done to your body!"
"Do not attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.  99.9% of the times I thought someone was being rude to me, or being mean or out to get me I did not have all the facts or did not fully grasp yet just how little anyone else actually thinks about you. 

Assuming no mental illness, feelings are transient, you travel through them, they are not destinations.  Enjoy the happiness when it is visiting and know that you will heal from the pain and it will pass you just have to travel with it a little while."
"Given time, patience and effort nearly every situation in your life will change, several times over."
The only constant is change.
Do what is best for you and your family. Companies do NOT care about you.
"Don't be a people pleaser. Nobody appreciates a people pleaser. You don't get any reward. They just assume you're a pushover. So do what is right for you, and quit trying to please everyone."
Every child needs love; regardless.
Which experience is that?
"Something can be your responsibility, even if it’s not your fault."
"People are okay, buts dogs are so much better!"
Rely on myself first
"At my age now (59) i just want no drama , so i try to be more chill. I also have no energy to get so worked up ."
"WE CANNOT
PRAY IN L0VE AND
LIVE IN HATE AND
STILL THINK WE
ARE WORSHIPING
G0D."
"Intelligence, knowledge and a formal education are very important, but wisdom is much better for you and those you're around."
"It’s all a construct, live as kindly and deliciously as possible day by day"
"Plan for the worst, hope for the best.  

If plan A doesn't work, figure out a plan B.  And work your way through the alphabet, if it's that important.

When you absolutely have tried your best, and it's still not working, cut your losses and walk away.

Don't remove future ""options"" because you'll need them when you least expect them.

If you run into one asshole, they're an asshole.  If you run into nothing but assholes, then it's a you thing.  Rethink yourself or the company you keep.

And most of all ... be true to yourself even if you won't admit it to anyone else. Self-responsibility will take you far further than giving your control to someone else."

"Nothing matters about what other think, feel, look like, what they say or do. You are your own person. Don't fit into the IT crowd. 

The world isn't going to end if you don't have the latest whatever and all your friends do. Suck it up buttercup. 

You are in this yourself. When it's all going to crap no one is there to help you, so man up and keep moving forward. No one cares

If you need help, calling your friends will teach you that everyone has a reason not to help

when a disaster hits, it's all for themselves for 48-72 hours. How you use those hours is up to you and it's your responsibility to save yourself. The Government isn't coming for at least 72-96 hours and the bad guys know it. 

Start saving as soon as possible. I have Roth IRA's setup for both my kids. 

Learn Civics because one day you might need to know how to hold a constitutional convention. 

When you're stopped by a cop, hand over your license and registration and never answer any questions. He doesn't care where you are going or where you are coming from. He is looking for probable cause to arrest you or search your car. Also don't be a dick to them, just hand the license and registration and no BS. Do what they say and you will be done quickly. And for goodness sake keep your hands on the steering wheel in plain site and no quick movements. they are already wondering, don't give them a reason. 

Your wife or partner will probably leave you at some point. No marriages or whatever last forever. This will usually happen when the last kid goes to college. Don't make a big deal at the divorce. Just get it over and move on. Also, don't get married again. It's not worth the hassle, just live together or date. 

Final fun fact... the stripper pole at the strip club spins around, not the dancer. So many people don't know this and I don't understand."

"Good stuff here, guys."
"SLOW DOWN. 

I have fallen several times but the worst was when I was too impatient to remove a baby gate  off the top level of a deck we had.  Ex husband put it there to prevent the dogs from shitting near the back door.  I was just going to step over it to feed them instead of taking the gate down.  I miscalculated my step and fell, breaking both of my feet.  In a wheelchair for 6 weeks."
"If you don’t need lots of stuff, find a way to do what you love when you’re young. Most of my siblings died young, so I did my bucket list in my 20s, 30s and 40s. I‘m in my 60s, and I would have a much harder time rock climbing, rafting, and hiking mountains today! I still hike and paddle, and am now motorcycling!"
"Love costs us nothing, but it means everything."
"You do not have to do it alone. Ask for help and generally, people will help you. This is not cheating. It’s okay to trade chores, have potluck dinners, and find people who will do the things you don’t like to do."
Don’t make decisions based on fear. Wished I learnt this as a teenager because it took me way way too long to get this
"Learn to sit with the pain.

"* We spend the first part of our lives trying to be who everyone thinks we should be.
* We spend the middle part of our lives trying to be who we think we should be.
* We spend the last part of our lives just being who we are."
"You become what you dwell on. 

If you always dwell on the negative, you tend to become a negative person. 

If you always dwell on the positive, you tend to become a positive person. 

Both of those extremes make obnoxious people. 

Personally, I look for the good traits I like in people and dwell on those. After so long that good trait becomes second nature to me."
"Pause 

Whatever it is, just pause

Unless you’re an EMT, almost nothing needs to be decided in an instant. Step back and take a minute or a day

Not every moment needs to be acted upon either. Pause, see what unfolds"
"Take your health and finances seriously. If those two things are in good shape, the world is yours."
"Its not always what you say, its how you say it.

You are not as important as you think at your job, they will replace you in a heartbeat if it suits them. 

Slowing down and doing it right will always be faster than doing it twice.  

in a relationship...

The saying ""Don't go to bed angry"" is BS arguing when you're tired will lead to saying things you don't want to say.

Both of you cant be going off the rails at the same time. nothing will get accomplished."
"That nothing lasts forever.  Good times, bad times. Just ride it out."
"Don't waste two things .. time or trust.

You'll never get either back."
"Quietly moving on from someone asking to prove them wrong is probably the best revenge. As the saying goes, “Ya can’t fix stupid” and you shouldn’t have to do their homework for them."
"People will come and go. That asshole co-worker/ex/friend of friend etc?  Meh. Guarantee you won’t know them in 20 years and you will laugh that they upset you, if you even remember them at all."
"Everyone thinks it’s the Big Decisions (like where to go to college, first job, etc) but it’s the small decisions that matter a lot more"
Other people are not thinking about you at all.
"Do whatever needed to maintain a healthy weight: obesity is no joke. It’s a prison sentence.

Get some financial education: not just household math, but long term financial planning for your life.

Time goes waaaaaayyyyy faster than you think. GET ON IT Because there is NOT time enough to “get to it later”.

Please don’t waste your one precious life."
"Don't let people rent your mind for free. In other words, let it go."
"If you’re gonna be dumb, you gotta work harder than everyone else to compensate.     
Don’t waste money trying to impress people. They probably won’t even notice.        
Be able to admit when you need help."
"Don't be afraid of things you don't need to be afraid of. It took a long time for me to understand the FDR quote, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" If it won't literally kill you, take a deep breath, and do it. Any embarrassment from failure will be short-lived and immediately forgotten by everyone but you.

edit: One more: ""Don't forgive because they deserve forgiveness; forgive because you deserve peace."""
"Here's some GenX slacker wisdom:   
Hollywood and Nike ads really sell you hard that you need to be striving for amazing goals every day and putting in 110% otherwise you're wasting your life. 

It's all corporate-America dream bullshit and its really up to you to decide if how you spend your days is working for you or not.   I think as long as you aren't a leach it doesn't really matter what anyone does with their life. 

I do suggest trying to take care of your health because maintenance will make your later years so much less problematic.   Realize that some of your life is just going to be wasted making some money.  You can offset some of that by trying to find a job you enjoy.

Personally, I'm proud of my career and family and the home my wife and I have created for ourselves but I could care less about ""winning"" anything or becoming famous.   


The only winners I've found are those who have found happiness within their own goals and means."
"I'll pass on philosophical and keep it to two simple categories.

Physical:  Keep moving.   Long walks, running, strength training, whatever.   When you get older, lack of physical activity hits you much harder than it used to (including mentally, really).  

Non-physical I:  Don't stress over life's little daily annoyances (traffic jams, someone cutting line, whatever) it just doesn't matter.

Non-physical II:  Enjoy things without becoming too attached.  Everything changes, don't let it ruin your enjoyment of the present.  For example, your last day of vacation is no different from your first day, other than you can let yourself feel down about it being the last day.

Just my 2c off the top of my head."
Don't make excuses. Nobody cares. Just own up to it and people will respect you for it.
"Trying, even if you fail, is better than not trying at all."
"Always take an opportunity offered to you when possible, even if it scares you or is way out of your wheelhouse"
Keep my mouth shut.
You can do everything right and still fail.
"That people will believe their own lies to keep their marriage/life safe, at the expense of others, and don't care who they destroy whilst doing so. Trust no one. Always be on guard. Don't invite crazy into your home."
"Life is more than just ""buying stuff"".  I have all of the ""stuff"" I need.  I like peace of mind and freedom.  I'm a bad consumer.  I'm happy with what I have."
I never learn :) I repeat the same stupid mistakes just like giving my heart to the wrong people.
"""No."" It is a complete sentence. It does not need any qualifiers."
Be kind.  Listen.  Don’t judge.
"The only person I can control is myself. 

Use things, and love/value people.

When things are unbearable, wait. It WILL change. 

Be kind. To others, and especially to yourself.

This is MY life. The opinions of others are irrelevant. 

The Four Agreements: I strive to live them."
Be self aware.
"People should NEVER stay married for the children. It’s better for children to have two happy parents who don’t live together than being miserable and having it affect everyone in the house with the animosity. 

Never use your children as pawns in a separation/divorce or speak negatively about their other parent. It’s not their fault and they don’t deserve that mental and emotional abuse they’ll have to work through."
"Life is not fair.

The world owes you nothing. 

Finding the right or wrong spouse affects your life more than any other decision you make.

Nobody cares what college you went to, except your college alumni fundraising department."
The green reed bends with the wind-Confuscious
"Being told to keep my mouth shut and do what I’m told and to be kind to others. This made me a push over. I helped others financially and never was paid back…”I promise I will pay you” “Can you watch my kids tonight?” (Last minute, so I’d cancel my plans) When I had my daughter and needed a sitter a hand full of times, those same people didn’t help me. It’s funny because they tell people that nobody ever helped them with their kids. Guess I’m a nobody. LOL. I allowed people to say whatever they wanted and I never spoke up. When I finally found my voice about 4 years ago…I’m 61 now…and learned to say “No” without making excuses, suddenly I was a bitch and they burned up their phones to talk about me. My sister was the worst. 
My advice is if you don’t want to go to a party, lunch, dinner, holiday gatherings, shopping, etc say NO and DO NOT offer an excuse!!! They will try to make you feel guilty, but don’t allow it!! Also, borrow money to NOBODY!!! 
PS. This winter I will not be clearing the neighbors snow. Came home from work (where part of my job is to clear snow) and my walks were not done but theirs were. We’ve always cleared neighbors (not elderly) but this year, I’m not doing it, nor is my husband. NO is a wonderful word and getting over the guilt is even better! I’m just sorry that I was a push over for so many years"
Don't drink or smoke.
"If it won't matter in 5 years, it's probably not worth a fight."
"Have a budget.

Live below your means.

Have an emergency fund.

Floss your teeth.

Cut out assholes from your life.

Live joyfully, it really pisses off the toxic folks in your life."
"Don't ask, don't get.  It never hurts to ask."
"Two wrongs don’t make a right, but three lefts do."
"Kindness, hard work, and lifelong learning.

Those are the keys to a happy, meaningful life.

(Prayer, charitable endeavors, and childrearing count as ‘work’, in this context.)"
"Stay far, far away from family and relatives."
A genuine smile can lighten a situation from the beginning.
Appreciate what you have instead of longing for what you think you don't have
"1. Everybody you meet is fighting a war you know nothing about. Give each other a break, when you can, and don't automatically jump to the worst conclusion.
2. Most people, most times are doing the best they can with the hand they've got. It's not always enough, but, it's usually the best they can do at that point in time.
3. ""I might be wrong""
4. Everybody you meet has something to learn and something to teach.
5. You're never under any obligation to set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.
6. In difficult conversations, pretend there is a third party there, listening in, someone whose opinion of you matters. This will help you from saying something you regret later."
beautiful list. Do you have any more?
Too late for my teeth 🤦‍♀️

"I’ve found posts online by complete strangers just full of compiled information about me. A bunch of stuff comes up if you google my name. There are archived topics on 4chan about me. Literal random strangers I don’t know whatsoever have spent a ton of time thinking and writing about me. 

Strangers in public also often come up to me to comment on me or ask rude questions. I never notice what strangers are doing if they’re not actively bothering me because I don’t care, but a lot of times I’ll be out with someone and they’ll be like “oh those people are staring and talking about you.”

I never know where people get this thing of “nobody is thinking about you,” tons of people have zero lives and obsess over what strangers are doing."
But that adds to 120. Inconceivable! /S

"Speech is silver, silence is golden"
"Very true. Be social with people, but don't yack-yack all the time. You will learn a lot about a person if you just listen to them. If they have the propensity to just de-mean another person, that is an absolute turn off. The conversation is no longer social."
Very poignée de porte

"I keep going back to this idea overtime,  sooo important! Now that I'm single after a divorce,  this has become a principle of mine..."
"Related to that, if your first impression of someone you meet is ""OK people but may be more trouble than they're worth"" *trust that instinct* and run."
I learned this the hard way. I was kicked to the curb by my boss at age 65 after working there for 24 years. He decided it was time for me to retire and rudely told me I had been replaced.

"A good friend told me that some behaviour that I had been exhibiting was perceived by many as rude, unfunny, and ostracizing. I had thought that I was being funny. Floored me lol."
"Building a life with my partner in mind. 
I mean everything. Was saving for a house. Went to school for a small major so she could pursue her huge one. 

Lost friends that disagreed. Lost time and sanity. Lost my patience. 

Right before my closest friend moved she inquired the date of the move. Dumped me a day before my best friend left. 

Wedding band still on my finger as she pulled out of my driveway for the final time. 


Now I’m left with a plan not designated for one person. A future I’d planned for gone in a moment. And a year and a half of therapy to try and get back to where I was before this mess. 



Plan for yourself. Always. Your partner should add to your plans. Not be your plans."
Got arrested by crooked homeland security officers at the border of mexico .. hit me with a felony for assaulting them to cover the fact that they assaulted me just for asking to speak to a supervisor becaue i was being legitly harrassed... spent 33 days in jail and county   and plead to a felony because the prosecutor and that entire town is corrupt asf..brownsville texas..the worst place ive ever lived at.
"Being fired from my first job, which before and after firing was so stressful I started developing an alcohol problem (ultimately dodged that bullet, thank God)."
"getting fired from a job for the first time haha man it felt like a break up and then i got fired from the next 2 jobs, it was really humbling i was kind of a jerk and needed my ass kicked to get my sht straight."
"Definitely when I lost my job, they let the whole department go. I was out of work for three months and it was hell. I would Uber in the mean time to try and pay my bills. I’m always on my toes at my job to make sure this never happens again and try to be super humble in all aspects of my life."
Having children.  You realize how little you know and how much your parents worked to get you to where you are today.
Dealing with chronic disease.
Graduate school.
Dropping out of grad school.
"I got into the trades in my late 20s. Great money but I got in with very little experience. The last 8 years have been nothing but humble pie. As soon as I’m getting into a groove, I switch projects or catch a layoff. My field is so vast and there are so many different types of work. I already journeyed out and have my state license but there are PLENTY of days where I feel like the dumbest guy on the jobsite"
"I think for me it’s understanding how uncaring life is for those who don’t decide and understand to prioritize themselves over anyone, including your family. This is not because they are bad (most of the time) it’s human nature. That even your siblings, partner or friends may decide to use things against you if they are at a fragile moment in life.

We are ultimately animals like any other in the kingdom that all want to survive, and we have the unique ability to be able to deceive ourselves from it. We also have emotions and that makes things so complicated. Like understanding that someone may be going through a tough time in life but if you help them, they will likely unintentionally sabotage you. I’ve realized that this is the main reason people are so hesitant to help children when they are facing a crisis. I never understood that as a child, or as an adult until recently. 

It’s only smart to think with your emotions once you have set a foundation that will filter out any threats to your self esteem/ social standing."
I became a millionaire in my 30s when I could have done so in my 20s. Don’t work for others.

Going broke after never having to deal with financial insecurity before.
Graduating and not being able to find a job for about a year. Finally taking a job I knew wasnt the best for me and ended up being there 8 months before laid off and again being out of work for another like 8 months.  During all of this time I didnt take unempliyment out of a fooliah sense of pride and as a result burned my hard earned savings.
"Had to sleep outside on the streets. Just sat by a corner and watched people walk past. I had nowhere else to go. 

I wasn't asking for money or anything but seeing so many people walk past me as if I was invisible was humbling. 

Taught me a very valuable lesson that has only since been reinforced since then, no one really gives a shit because they got their own shit to figure out."
My first AA meeting
"It’s a long story, but basically experiencing homelessness for a few hours. Or rather not knowing where I was going to sleep. It made me feel microscopic. I still remember crying in the rain. I’d never complain about housing ever again. Hotel, hostel, dorm, apartment, closet I didn’t care. As long as there was a roof over my head."
I've had three people I know admit that I'm the reason they didn't kill themselves. What the fuck do you do with that?
getting sober
For me it was being a freshman at the #3 top University in the U.S. (2000 rankings) and seeing how far ahead of me the other students were academically.
Abusive relationship. Alcoholism and Rehab.
When I realized I had just been lucky instead of being “awesome”
"Becoming a mom. 

Most humbling but also most rewarding experience in my life."
Woman.
Being an EMT.
having kids in a pandemic ! it made me want to be better version of myself. I realized I've  become a more compassionate and flexible!
Being laid off
"Developing Epilepsy, and getting diagnosed with Asperger’s as an adult"
"Ulcerative Colitis.  

It robbed me of years of my life.  I’ve never taken anything for granted since, and I view every day and every good thing as a gift."
"Talking to other people and realizing I don't know as much about the world as I thought I did. I read a lot growing up but there are some things that are not always in book. It is a humbling, scary and invigorating experience. 

It pushes me to learn more about everything the world has to offer so I can be a more well-rounded, educated and empathetic person."
"Almost drowned. Realized,within limits, people’s opinions are worthless. Changed my life outlook and trajectory."
My father passing away
Getting kicked out of law school while doing an unpaid law internship
"In 2013 I needed help. Badly. I'd always been self-sufficient, never needed anyone, never needed/sought advice, certainly never needed help with school or studying. The one time, the one (and first time) I desperately needed help in my life absolutely no one was there for me. Not even the people whose job it was to care.

It was humbling, and horrifically destructive to my life. But I do take it \*extra\* seriously when others ask for help now. Particularly when it's a person who rarely or never did so before.

FFS, we need a nicer world."

No gold watch?
Feels good!
Say it LOUDER
"I noticed that when people hear your story, or what you are going through, they are saying sorry sure, but they are also saying to themselves......""thank fuck I'm not going through that"". People 100% do not give a shit."
Gratitude is the attitude.
Hopefully you changed
"It bears repeating: a partner should be an add to your plans, not be the plan. Sorry that happened to you."
"thanks for the advice your sacrifice wont be in vain bro i will avoid that town on purpose, and refugio tx is like that too with their bs speed traps im glad the hurricane damaged their town really bad too"
Yikes. I’m a white dude that lived in Culiacan and been hassled by boarder or whatever at the airport. Was stuck for 12+hours. And now I must be flagged because I get seriously questioned all because I lived there.
"Yeah that’s an aspect of human nature that most people don’t fully understand. The preying of people on certain races. 

I’m assuming you are Latino."
Good work friend. Currently 1 day sober. Funnily enough my drinking was also triggered by a stupid job. Hope you're doing better.
Been thru that. My humble pie.
How intense/hard it is/was?
You have any advice on how to accumulate wealth when you are on your own with no support from family? Where working is a bit of a must for a snapshot of time. I’m 21 in school and racking up debt. I have interest in real estate and am looking to start my own thing to support me while in school but it’s honestly so stressful. Any advice would be appreciated thanks.
Most people are or have to be worker bees tbh
[deleted]
I appreciate the last sentence. That’s what probably helped you avoid that situation again.
yeah I remember this feeling in San Francisco well
"Lack of boundaries, not your fault."
You can always be both.
"I started in EMS at 18 and it made me grow up FAST. I lasted until I was 33 (full time), then just part time/volunteer since. I’m completely out now though. Life is so different after a career like EMS"
"Asperger’s in general is incredibly humbling, especially since nobady really seems to understand it (most practitioners)"
Very humble answer. These are what I look for.
How do you correlate drowning with peoples opinions?
Omg that must have been painful man. I’m sorry you had to experience that. ☹️

Mosquito burgers in Africa was what I watched on YouTube. Very humbling
I did but not the point
Live a learn. Aliens exist so I’m not really tripping
They target males crossing the border.. always have a camera..those towns are filled with corrupt lawyers judges etc making money off innocent and not inncoent people ..its insane ..hope those places rot.
They have too much power and the legal system is big business down there .. yea they screwed me pretty bad and thats only some of the story
Yup.. they know we are poor .. cant afford lawyers ..not educated in the crooked legal system.. after i got arrested i started to notice all the lawyer ads in that town and jails built ..seemed soo corrupt....did more research and the town is filled with cartel and corruption from top to bottom..judges being arrested etc
Keep at it my man!
"Just different than what I knew.

Had to learn how to separate my self-worth from my success or failure.  Research is an area where 95+% of the time, you’re going to be failing.  That makes it really difficult to cope with if you’ve spent your whole schooling career believing that you’re capable of succeeding because you’re doing well.

Something like that, at least."
"Truth. Not everyone can be a boss, quite literally."
Advice for a success is endless. Take action.
"When I see homeless people on the street now, I feel sadness for their plight but moreso guilt that as much as I dislike doing it, I find myself looking away so I don't meet their gaze, so I don't have to say ""no,"" so I don't have to confront what I can do but choose not to."
"I mean it wasn't like a ""If you don't do this or"" anything like that it was just something that came up in conversation. Each one had been contemplating it but thinking about me or me caring about them stopped them. None of them made a point of telling me.   


I love that I did that but it also kind of reframes so many decisions in my life. I mean there are those ""if only I had done...different"" but now when I see those questions it's like Clarence sitting on my shoulder going ""If you were there where you wanted to be you wouldn't have been where you needed to be""   


That's humbling as fuck because there was a time in my life I beat myself up for the consequences of my decisions but now looking back. I was just loving the people around me and sharing what I love about life and yet between my daughter dumping a potentially abusive boyfriend because I supported her. Saving my best friend because I give a shit about him and a day doesn't go by I'm not sending him stupid bullshit texts.   


These are all things I didn't think anything of they were unimportant bullshit. But they mattered and it's like fuck."
"Nice run, I did it from 30 to 36 before moving into management. There were a couple of, very quiet, long haul intra-facility night trips I did as a tech that changed the basic brain chemistry of who I am as a personality."
Thank you.
"I should elaborate. When I got pulled out of water into the jet ski and we went back to the dock no body except my family cared what had happened even though they saw it. Folks just had a “So” attitude in their demeanor, body language etc.and we’re enjoying the beach. Even though I almost lost my life no body was really bothered.I come from a state socialist society and you at least care about how folks around you are doing or keep it in mind. This was in Florida vacation the rip current happens after sand bar caves in under the water. Just made me realize no one cares and there is as much as a dissolved society here as possible. It was an unforgettable experience made me realize there is no social contract in extreme extreme capitalist USA when moment of truth showed up. I still donate and help folks where I can but man this place is something else. My brother was the only one who called life guard. Crazy realization."
Never ever play yourself.
😆 Maybe your new love will be an alien! 👽
Thank you. 💕 (And I’m proud of you.)
"They are making you responsible over their ability to survive, even if only emotional. It’s immature, even if they had plenty of reasons to feel that way."
"Yeah I noticed that too. My ""friends"" didn't really care when I was almost lost at a lake. They were also just enjoying themselves. I think humanity is just like this. They only care if it benefits them. Selfish shits who deserve to be annihilated."
Gonna have to agree to disagree.
With me? You think they should have done that?

"I am a guy but I saw my ex's (then girlfriend) friend kissing her on her lips for straight 4-5 seconds while seeing each other off and my ex didn't even hesitate . I literally thought she was Bi or gay but when I asked her, she told me that girls do that stuff all the time. Although we broke up for some other reason but I don't know the truth till today."
"My friend kissed me on my nose.

That day I realised I was definitely straight."

"I was in nursery or kg maybe and had a fight with a girl on who's food is better but food was finished so we tasted each other's mouths ifykyk, realised in 9th ki first kiss toh ho gayi bc

Also once in a empty classroom a girl sat on the table and opened her legs and I was alone with her and it was soo uncomfortable fr never talked again 

A girl was obsessed with holding and rubbing my thighs for sm reason and we had to sit together which made it so weird and in a joking way we both got into a relationship (it was joke) she turned out to be a actual lesbian and I ghosted her and changed my batch

A girl told me she loves me and dreams about us traveling the world and going to college together nd all (she's my bestie toh ig chalta h)"
bhai ''females'' kaun likhta hai yaar??![img](emote|t5_2zhzn|31421)

"Bro even straight girls act like leso with their “bff” ![img](emote|t5_2zhzn|28582)

My bestie and I were playing the pepero game (you have to eat a piece of chocolate with 2 mouths at the 2 ends). We did it with a cheeto. In a moving bus. Ended up *kinda* kissing.
Kisses. Continuous kisses all over my face.![img](emote|t5_2zhzn|30131)
One of my only 2 crushes I've ever had (both fictional 💀) is a girl I guess that counts as gay
My birth probably
"Let me put this in the most respectful way I can....I hypothesis that, Women are by default lesbians....they don't have any gæ experiences....I have seen women who barely knew each other do stuff which I won't do to any of my friends...a 5 second eye contact with a guy makes me awkward but grills hugs, kiss and do all sorts of physical shit in the gayest way possible and still have the f\*ckin audacity to call themselves straight...I wont be this touchy to my own wife...while you guys do all the babu shona...having intense convos and relationship shit in gossip groups as I observe from a far...So I have come to that conclusion....

This further strengthens my theory of women being a conspiracy by government to distract us from our goals"
she gave me a kiss on my cheek ( plus i am not even straight so like i had butterflies lmao )
date a girl lol
Kuch nhi I hate holding hands and hug krna mere friends ko girls but I love themmmm besties 😂😂

Lol
Made out regularly!? You're just 17
Also exchanged rings on the left ring finger. And act like each others' S/O all the time.

For Prometheus, I'm still wondering if i should see it or not. I just know that Magneto's actor from xmen is in it."
"Even women are weird. 

To summarize it, 
Humans are weird in general."

shh boys ko nhi pata chalni chahiye ye ![img](emote|t5_2zhzn|31414)
It sucked. Found out how sheltered I was growing up and how bad I am at relationships. I would still go through with it because you can’t learn from mistakes if you don’t make them.
"I know a couple of people who married late after being perennially single, and they were very happy and clearly appreciated married life a lot.

22 is really not that old for relationships, although with socializing and dating becoming more difficult, you're more justified in being worried than the 22 year olds when I was that age (around 20 yrs ago).

I would really emphasize, invest way more energy in meeting somebody through an in-person network of whatever kind, not online dating. You may keep up a profile or two, but don't take it seriously. Join interest-based communities. Be extremely socially active. This will benefit you in multiple ways beyond making it more likely that you'll meet people for relationships. Your social life will be more active, you'll have community, you'll be more likely to have friends even in ages when most people find it difficult to make friends, you'll be more engaged in at least one of your interests. You'll have more to talk about. And the people you'll be having relationships with will also be more social which will be a benefit for your and their mental and physical health, as well as a good influence on your children if you have any."
"Anon, I am 33 and still waiting for my shot to. One thing I can tell you, is women come and go, you will have bouts of good days and lonely days. Don't let your desire for connection allow you to live your life in vain. Not like me. Build yourself up, and focus on what makes you happy."
36 and ssssssoooooo worth it!  My advice is that being lonely sucks but being with the wrong person is far worse.
"I'm in that same boat right now. I'm 23, I've spent probably half my life where all I wanted was a significant other, I have missed out on all the young love that people always romanticize, and now I am struggling to decide if its worth it to keep up hope, or just try to rise above the desire for love you know. it sucks

&#x200B;

edit: there has been a lot of great support in the replies, i thank everyone for that. I do however want to comment on something that has come up often. I understand it isnt meant to be taken this way but saying that 22/23 is still young just feels dismissive, like telling someone with depression 'someone has it worse' or telling a teenager theyll grow out of it. I recognize it is truly still fairly young, but still i have missed many milestones that come with dating. Because of all these missed milestones, and several other factors, I dont think I would even be able enter the dating scene until age 28 (I figure by then I could be physically, mentally, emotionally and financially fit enough to start). Thats when my peers would be trying to settle down, while Ill be trying to figure out what i like in a partner, what clicks what doesn't etc. To use a chess analogy, people are moving to the mid game, and I'm still figuring out what the pieces do.

This may have come off as a bit whiny, i am still truly appreciative for the great support we have gotten in the replies, but all this is to say that saying we're still young, at least to me,feels like you're tussling my hair and saying 'oh you'll learn when you're older little Timmy'."
"Yes! Didn’t get my first bf/summer fling and have sex until 24. No dates or anything before then… just didn’t happen. At the time I told myself it was totally possible I’d never meet anyone, so I should make sure my life is good even if I am alone forever.

You have plenty of time. Don’t ‘wait’- use your time to make new friends, do things you like - it’ll make figuring out the right partner much easier if you know yourself and what you like, if/when you do meet them. And if you don’t, then you still have an awesome life and group of friends."
Go out to as many events and social interactions as you can. The only way to meet a woman is to put yourself out there.
"Don’t fall for simp syndrome. It’s a curse for both men and women alike. It’s when you’re new to relationships so when you find a significant other, you become so obsessed with keeping them around that you essentially become a people pleaser. Only manipulators  and stuff like people pleasers. Normal people don’t. I can tell you from experience it’s a tempting hole to fall into. You’ll only push a potential partner away and give yourself bad habits"
it was definetely worth it for me. i met my partner at a networking event. join things you have an interest in and love might find you unexpectedly there...................

One of the best coworkers of my life found love around her 40s. Over 20 years later and she still blushes and gets giddy talking about her husband. They're polar opposites and the most endearing and adorable couple I've seen.
"Hi Bro, don't get overwhelmed or desperate to have someone by your side.  
In my experience, my first relationship was until my 22s. 

From what I remember when I was 14 years old until almost my 20s, I was always worried about having a girlfriend (probably like you).  
In my 20s I changed my mentality and just focus on having fun with my stuff, spending time on my interests, and playing rugby (this sport teach me too much about life and learn about myself). Then, I knew a girl in my 22s and we were sweethearts for almost 4 years.

**My advice** is to try to find a hobby that fills you with passion, enriches you as a person and you learn to be alone, that you enjoy being with yourself.   
The idea of having a girlfriend is not a priority.  


I hope this brief summary of my life and advice will help you."
How old are you?
"Learn how to love, forgive and accept yourself. You can't love anyone if you don't love yourself."
"Bro, it was *totally* worth it. It’s awesome. It’s like living your life in black and white and then seeing in color. It’s like there’s this higher plane of existence that you didn’t know existed. Everyone else is living at 11 while you were stuck at 10."
"Be thankful. Most people don't know what they want out of life, much less another person.
I waited till I was 33. I'm in a very fulfilling relationship with an amazing girl!
The only thing I'll say is to keep your expectations in check, ask what you can give someone else and why you want a girlfriend. 
It's not her responsibility to make you happy or to make your life more fulfilling. 
That is your responsibility."
"Had my first relationship when I was 29. I learned that I was woefully inexperienced with relationships, I was codependent, and inadequate at identifying red flags and enforcing boundaries out of fear of losing her. I also learned that being alone is far better than being with the wrong person.

My advice would be to let go of the fear of losing people. Don't settle because you fear this is the best you can get. Don't be afraid to make mistakes; you will learn and you will grow. learn what your boundaries are, and enforce them. Listen to your gut, not just your heart or your genitals."
"You need to build yourself as a man a girl wants to be with, go to the gym, improve your social skills and it will be so easy to get a relationship, it seems like you struggle with confidence so build confidence, if you aren’t born with confidence the way to master it is to respect yourself and the only way you are gonna respect yourself is if you achieve your goals and work hard on improving yourself, and for relationships you should just get with a few girls before you look for your dream type as you are gonna want experience with relationships for a higher value girl otherwise she will be with a man that knows how to be a gentleman already"
"Dated all through h s & college. 

Never putting 1 woman on a pedestal ever again. 

Sums up my experience."
"I was 28 when I got my first relationship and it was amazing. In hindsight I wish I was able to let myself be vulnerable much earlier and date earlier in life. You learn so much about yourself in a relationship. For 2 years I have discovered a different side of me, positive and negative.  
Unfortunately things did not work out and recently we broke up, it hurts but I will be okay. It was an amazing experience to look back on and I now have a clear picture what I want from my next relationship."
"I'm 27 and I just experienced it myself. It's definitely worth it, but be warned that once you kind of 'unlock' those emotions you're also going to be unlocking the baggage that comes with them. I didn't know I was capable of feeling lonely until I had my first break up. It's kind of questionable, really; the highs of enjoyment with a significant other are higher, and the lows without them are lower. So... Roll the dice at your own peril."
"Being alone leads to depression. You need someone that shares your life, unless You want to go mad....

Do not look for a lifetime romance, just sharing a flat with one or two Friends with similar interests can be ok.
Dogs can be excellent Friends and beyond loyal !!!"
Not worth it. I don’t even know if I can call it love. Relationships at a young age basically consist of lust and childhood trauma manifesting as problems.
"I (25f) just recently got out of a pretty serious relationship. This was my first serious relationship since I left highschool so it's been a fat minute. In the end yes, I think that that relationship was worth it. It hurt, when it ended...like a lot.  The healing process felt like forever. During that process though, I got a better understanding of what I'm looking for in a partner and gave me a better understanding on how to be a better partner too. My views on relationships and dating definitely changed for the better. 

I like to make lists so here we go. 
1. The best way to find someone is through a community that you and your potential partner are both in. That way you guys already have something in common and if they're big on quality time, BOOM! Do that hobby together. 
If you guys don't have a common interest yet, you guys can find one together, create new memories together. Just make sure they are open to finding new interests. ( Past partner absolutely hated trying to new things, due to his anxiety of not being good at it).
2. Your self worth isn't a reflection of your compatibility  with someone.
3. Dating apps are great to meet new people, but don't expect to get a serious relationship out of them."
"I had my first relationship just last year at 20, I'm 22 now. Weird to think I've been through two birthdays since then. 

Anyway, was it worth it? Absolutely for me it was. Despite the pain that came with things ending between us last December, I'll never regret the time I spent with her. That feeling is what pushed me to be better as a person, even after our breakup."
"I started dating when I was 24. Until then, I had happily given up on romantic love and decided it wasn't for me after I had rejected a string of male friends and randos. I had lost interest in men and was content living my fullest individual life with family and friends, doing all my favorite things.

Last year I fell in love. Even though he didn't have many of the things I had formally looked for in a future partner, somehow everything seemed right. We have been together since January this year, and he is the person I want to marry. He has told me the same since the beginning.

My advice to you is to build yourself up before you worry about getting with someone else. This means finding your own hobbies, spending time doing what makes you happy, and occupying your mind by furthering your own person. Be okay being by yourself, so that you won't be desperate for companionship and you'll be ready to meet your person/people where they are and grow together instead of hinging everything on whether it works out with them. Make friends wherever you are (school, work, etc.), and if you've run out of options, find ways to go to Meetups or make online friends. When you find someone who's a little different in a good way, you'll know. This is where I repeat that sickening cliche about 'finding love where you least expect it', because it happened to me and I found someone so worth waiting for."
"I’m 30 and while I’ve dated for ~15 years, I’m in the first healthy, loving romantic relationship of my life. Every day I get to wake up and be so grateful that this person is in my life, that somehow we’ve found each other. I really, really tried in other relationships I’ve been in, but nothing lasted longer than 6-8 months. Every disappointment, every “heartbreak” I thought I’d experienced, even the really awful stuff, was worth it to be the person I am now, who somehow fell in love with the best person I’ve ever met. Neither of us are perfect, but we work towards being perfect for each other. Yes, it is worth it.

Now advice: at 22, date everyone. You don’t have to sleep with everyone if it’s not your jam (although this will also help you be a better partner later!) but go on dates. You’ll learn what you like, what you don’t like (but can accept), and what’s an absolute dealbreaker. You’ll get more comfortable in your own skin. You’ll learn how to communicate: being able to be upfront with someone when you don’t see a second date in the works is a hell of a conversation to have, but you’ll learn how to have hard conversations with people, which is something you’ll need with a future partner. 

It can be lonely — I spent a few nights crying and wondering if there was ever anyone that would see me and love me in the way I wanted. It’s cliche advice for a reason: when you stop looking, you fall in love. 

Also, with the dating apps: if someone isn’t immediately your type, give it a shot. My partner photographs terribly but I am ridiculously, absurdly attracted to him and have been since day one. He’s got pheromones or something, I don’t know, but it breaks my brain sometimes hahah."
"Bro you haven’t missed out on anything you are very young at 22. Anyway, don’t get hung up about “young love”, it’s anything but special. It’s hard to navigate stuff when your brain isn’t done cooking. Expand your worldview in other ways and you’ll be better for it."
I'm 39 and I let the love of my life slip away because I wasn't able to truly know she actually genuinely did love me as much as she said. She was  absolutely the most amazing woman and I fucked it up..... now I'm so depressed and angry with myself its hard to even think about ever finding someone who could possibly love me like my ex use to....
I’m 23 male I’ve had a first love and 1 real relationship but never casually dated due to mental health reasons and recently I got with this girl and we’ve gotten close and it’s looking like we may end up moving in together after 8 months of being together and I never realized how much the average people casually date after she shared a lot of stories and for me it was hard because I never really had that experience of dating and putting myself out there and I do regret not doing that. I feel like it’s important for people to do when getting ready settle down with someone special you meet that’s the only thing I found hard is just not going through it myself and I dated maybe 3 people realistically. I highly encourage casually dating as it is good for social development. I’m happy with her and do have that regret but I’ve let it go.
Be happy on your own first!
"You’re never too old man, the right person will come along for you. You have to be the best person you can now, so when they come along you will be there for them ;)"
"Idk if you would you consider it late,but I do regret not waiting for my bf. I wish he would have been my first and only person."
Ime no it wasn’t. I lost what I now consider precious time with my mother who was sadly only here for a short time. Love isn’t always love it’s lust. If you’re looking for love let it find you and then if your lucky you’ll get to keep it and cherish it for yourself with the person you love. Jme. I hope you find what you’re searching for OP.
"I met my first love (still going strong) when I was 27 🥰 I had only dated previously at that age, never had a boyfriend. It was all organic. As cliche as it sounds, the right guy will come along eventually. We just clicked and it went up and up from there.
I do wish that I had more experience sometimes but at the same time, I’ve achieved most of what I could control in life until I met him. Studied, got my own place, have savings, got a decent job, and yeah. I think I would have taken longer to achieve these things if I was in a relationship at the time but of course I can’t say for sure. 
My advice: socialise more in settings where you can meet new people (I met my bf through a work social event), try online dating, just put yourself out there or you won’t meet anyone (let’s just say I chilled at home way too much instead of potentially meeting people earlier).
I see myself as an awkward and shy person when I’m in unfamiliar settings with people I don’t know so make sure you have people you’re comfortable with in social situations where possible."
I'm early 30's. Never been in a relationship.
"I had my first everything when I was 21. Now in hindsight I totally could have waited a lot longer, there’s no hurry. It would have been worth it to wait couple more years in my case.

My advice to someone still ”waiting” is that if you really want a partner, just waiting won’t do anything. You gotta be really active in your pursuit. But at the same time like I said, I don’t think you’re in a hurry. I know it’s hard to not stress about these things, but now that I’m 30 and with more life experience, I can say confidently that you still have a lot of time. 

There’s honestly so much more to life than romantic relationships! The issue is that we are always focusing on what we’re missing."
"I haven't experienced it very late but I usually have long gaps between partners. Plus I don't actively search for partners. So, I don't fit the criteria you set exactly for the advice you asked for but I'll say this. Love is a beautiful thing. When 2 people are in love, it's a feeling you can't exactly describe with words. It's exciting and sets your mind on fire. It's amazing and everyone should definitely experience it.

That being said, I'm currently single and not actively looking for partners. Because I have some other goals for my life right now and having a partner will not be possible during this phase. I'll still tell you though, don't give up on love. You don't need to feel low about not having experienced it till now but at the same time don't just give it up entirely.

Appreciate life. It has a lot to offer. Form meaningful bonds with people. Learn how to be a great friend. Travel. Experience things. Live life. Your life shouldn't become this thing where you have so much time to sit and compare yourself with others. It should help you get more out of life. This will help you not feel very low about not having a partner yet. But at the same time, when you finally get a loving partner, you'll be an excellent one at that. 

A relationship requires a lot of work. Lots of dedication. It's not a cakewalk. There will be times when you'll be at the top of the world and times when you'll want to wring the soul out of your partner (don't actually do it 😋), but you'll have to communicate, respect each other, and work together on figuring out your path together.

The most important things are respect, communication, and honesty. Be transparent about your lives. Talk things out. Show effort. I remember when I thought one of my relationships was dying and I just gave up. I didn't put in much work after that. I caused a lot of frustration for my partner. But she made a photo album by hand. The effort she put into it, completely shook me awake. I knew I can't just let someone this amazing just fade away from my life that easily. I put in more efforts and we managed to reignite that spark again. It was amazing.

Your life shouldn't depend on a lover for it to be complete. Be complete on your own. So that you can add to each other's lives.

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk 😋"
"I experienced one-sided love a lot of times. And from that phase, it turned to 'meeting multiple men and having one night stands I already accepted there's no one for me' phase.

I got my first real relationship at 29 and still shocked that we're together for more than a year now."
"Be yourself, get rid of fear of losing her. Have boundaries. Love her but don't let her change you unless it's something like she wants u to ""stop using drugs"" and shit. 

Have mature love, if she ain't understanding.. it's not worth it."
"Never give up and don’t just accept someone you really don’t care about, there’s a country western song about that. Be a friend, looks fade but personality stays, volunteering may lead to new friends and that can be partnerships too. I got remarried at 69 and yes, older relationships are challenging, but so is work and children. Don’t give up."
"Been single my whole life but had FWB here and there,
with 25 I then met my gf and the search has been so worth it"
"Go live your life, have interesting hobbies, build a small close knit friend group, love yourself first and let your positive experiences build you into an interesting person that attracts interesting people. I spent my 20s traveling, backpacking, leaning into my hobbies and when I finally decided to give dating a serious effort it all worked out for me. Married this year at 33."
Being in my late 30’s I don’t think I’ll find love. Am still waiting and being hopeful maybe one day there a good woman out there for me.
"LATE? Friend, you’re early. Late would be 35, 40 - or even older. You’re fine, and it’ll happen. :)"
"I have several friends who didn’t really start dating until their mid to late twenties and are doing fine and others who dated and married young and ended up divorced. 

Everyone is different and there is no right or wrong timeline. You’re too young to be worrying about it and way to young to be talking about giving up."
"If you close yourself off from the world, the world will close itself from you. So I'd say remain open but in the meantime, work on being the best person you can be."
"You'll never know what and if at all the ""big love"" looks like. That's why people tell people to just be themselves. If you are yourself and happy with most aspects of live, you find someone cheering you and your life - adding something that was never really necessary. And that's the best feeling."
"It's always nice to have attention from the opposite sex. Flattering even.

But as I grow older, I've become more inflexible. Like I won't change my entire life and being for them. I'll adapt and compromise but that really shrinks my pool of options. 

I'm fine with being myself so it's not too much of a bother. But if you'd like to expose yourself, doing a shared activity is a good start"
"I had four relationships in my 20s (first relationship at 24 years) and early 30s that lasted at least a few years each. And by the time I ended the fourth relationship (after 7 years of trying), I was ready to give up on love.

But the decision to respect myself and my needs really helped. I decided I would not take any toxic attitudes and behaviours from anybody. And I focused on being the best person I could be... I started working on myself, my health, my hobbies, and my work with complete focus. And before I knew it, I'd met someone with whom I connected very easily and who I could see as a long-term partner. She's now my wife... we got married when I was in my late 30s. 

You're still quite young. Work on yourself and become a person with whom others would want to be in a relationship. Love can happen anytime in life and it's worth waiting for."
"I feel you, man. 
Well, I was raised in a very dark malacious religious cult (because my parents are part of it as long as I can remember). I barely saved my life from running away from them and their life style a few years ago; considering what they put me through for all those years screwed with my psychology, wellbeing, and conscious, I don’t and won’t regret this decision. I just had to share this insight stuff briefly so that you can fathom what I’ve been going through for 15 years now since the day my parents decided to send me to this evil cult’s so called “private educational instutitions” (the schools that stole my middle school years and high school years from me). This caused me not never develop those skillsets which you get via social interactions with peer (not even mentioning any sort of interactions with girls). I now have social anxiety disorder, complex-PTSD, and depersonalization-derealization disorder which interfere with my life on many domains. I’ve been going to therapy for almost 2 years now, my life literally shifted, ngl, but therapy never helped when it comes to having to be able to approach girls romantically. I am 23 now never even kissed nor did I hold hands with a girl. I of course had girls that I liked / had crush on multiple times (over the course of past 17 years) which I sometimes naturally achieved to make it clear to that person; however though the lack of experience, my disorders, my upbringings were more than enough to fetter my possibilities with the person. Anyways, I have been actively challenging my social anxiety disorder for several months now which helped me to be able to invite people to my birthday (which I have never been able to do it up until my 22nd birthday last year), have random verbal interactions with girls, and to have fun on such social settings such as bars, clubs, pubs, ... etc even if I am solo. But I still can’t go beyond where I am currently stuck on when it comes to establishing even a friendship with a girl. Here is why, I am kind of keeping myself from talking to the pople in opposite sex in some sense due to me not being able to make eye contact (especially with women) because of all the horrible, inhumane, and messed-up things I have had to through when I was in that pure evil cult. My eyes just autonomously gets lowered and vast majority of the times girls take this as as if I an checkign them out which is clearly not the case. By the way, as for my personality, I am a trueborn funny, a real nerd, an affectionate and thrustworthy person. I stay in shape, and I would describe myself as a quite organized person. I really don’t have any insecurities about myself. And also this is my 5th year at the universty I go to, and seems like I have at least 2 years to go (aside from this school year) if not more. As you may already know, once you hit your mid-20s the dating life just goes downhill if you don’t have your life in order (interactions with the opposite sex-vise, for me especially), no matter how charming & attractive of smart you are. Considering the fact that girls around my age tend to either have a boyfriend (at this point in their life) or taking a break from all that relationship stuff; I am out of options at this point because I literally tried everything to fight off my ill fortune so to say. But here I am at 23 ..."
"I thought it was worth it, because I had friends who got into relationships in middle/high school and I knew what to look out for and how to navigate a relationship better once I got into my first relationship in my 20s. My advice would be to work towards being happy with yourself or at the very least content with being alone. I’ve noticed people seem to rather be in a bad relationship than be alone but if you are content with yourself, I think that prevents that from happening as much."
"I certainly thought it was a worth while experience. Part of the reason it took so long to find was because I sought out a genuine connection, which of course made our relationship have a more impactful, meaningful impression on me. 

My advice to you would be to follow my suit and not settle for anything less than true chemistry. Relationships require a lot of time and energy, so it’s never made sense to me to pursue something serious with someone i wasn’t serious about."
"I don't know if this counts, but I'm divorced. Met my ex when I was 18. Now that I'm older and wiser I met the actual love of my life at 31. If I had to it all over again, I would never have gotten married. That wasn't love. I always wished I had spent more of my twenties focusing on myself, learning, working, having fun, making friends. Instead I just put all my energy in my relationship because I was so excited. But...I didn't take time to reflect on how we weren't right for each other. 

So...relationships are great, I totally understand why people want to be in them. But I've learned there's so much more to life than being in love. The right person will come along and it'll be all that much better because it'll be right."
22 isn’t late at all. You’re fine bro. Just roll with it
"I’m currently 29 and I haven’t had a relationship with a woman in almost 10 years. I kissed a girl for the first time in a year last night which was nice but besides having flings here and there, no relationship. I try to look at the little things I’ve experienced and tell myself that I’ll get mines one of these days. To keep working on myself until I do get there. I suggest the same for you."
"Wow. 22 is relatively young. That was the year I moved to NYC and started living my life, in fact. For personal reasons, I wanted to save myself, so I decided to enjoy my entire 20’s as a happy, single woman. Focused on self-love, my career, saved up, traveled solo, joined classes, got my masters, went skydiving and didn’t miss any events and roadtrips with friends. Pretty much just made lots of memories. There were times of course where I thought about dating but for some reason I knew I wasn’t there yet. I’m pretty spiritual so prayed a lot and counted my blessings more than worry about what was missing. I also knew in my heart that if I did start dating, it wouldn’t take long before I would find my life partner so I didn’t worry too much. When I hit 30, that’s when I decided I’ve done everything I wanted to do in my single life and am ready to experience new adventures with a significant other. That’s when I moved to another country and opened up to the idea of dating - met some nice guys and those who just want some. Knew better than to stick around of course. Had a crash course of heartbreaks too haha Fortunately didn’t last too long as I met and married the man of my dreams 2 years later. We did a 6-month long honeymoon last year and am now expecting my first child at 35. It was worth the wait. I don’t regret my choice to be single all of my 20’s because I never felt like I missed out on anything; more like saved myself from unnecessary heartaches. I used that time to be the happiest, best, most content version of myself. When I was ready, I was whole, secure and at peace with myself. I knew I was dating not for someone to fill a void in me or make me happy, instead I was looking for my equal/ forever partner to share life with. It’s never too late to find love. Don’t let society tell you otherwise."
"Best advice I can give are two advices: you're of course never too old and, more importantly, life isn't a goalpost of achievements and activities even if society and those around you make it feel that way. 

You can always have a gf younger and find out you fucked up tons later on life and vice versa. There is never a clear and definitive answer in this stuff. So saying what I did, work on what you feel can help you toward your goals whether it's slowly but surely and don't sweat being 22 and not hitting milestones of sorts; no one has a universal guide and when you should have a gf or meet your true love so why sweat that stuff? 

I'm not saying it won't suck or it's easy but stressing and wondering on this subject Dan only lead to more anxiety and anxiousness about whether you're on some track to meet the right person despite the fact there is no track of sorts. Just love you're life and focus on you and while it's easier said than done the counter part is why sweat what's outside your control when you can focus on that which you can control? Easier said than done I know but not like I'm wrong either in that assessment."
"I was 23 when I met my partner. Eleven years on and we're getting married next year.

It was worth waiting until I had a real connection. I have all the happiness and none of the regrets."
Your good man. Lots of guys dont experiance first love until later in their 20s.
I never thought I’d get married and wasn’t looking for love. I made it to thirty-four without ever having had a serious relationship. Then i met my wives and we were all married in less than six months. You never know what the future holds.
"I’m (36F) and married my wife (37F) this year. We’ve been together almost 4 years. 

She would be the love of my life. I didn’t have my first serious relationship until I was about 26. I enjoyed dating and sex (began all that around age 19), but I just really enjoyed my independence and freedom. I lived in a few different countries and wanted to build my career. 

The person I am now and the person I was in my 20s is like night and day. 

I cannot stress enough how important your 20s and early 30s is to your own personal growth and development. 

Enjoy being sociable and slutty in your youth. Settle down with a well-rounded, mature adult in your mid to late 30s. It’s the fucking best!!!"
"I was 26, fell in love, lost virginity, had my heart ripped out. Worth every second."
I would say dating early and going through all the mistakes you make dating sooner would help you figure out what you really want when you’re older. Plus you get the experience and skills needed to make relationships at an older age more successful. Everyone’s got their own journey but that’s my perspective. I worked on myself for 7 years and waited till mid 30’s to start a real relationship and didn’t regret it. But I know the mistakes I made in my first two taught me what to avoid and how to value myself enough to wait that long.
"I didn’t start dating until I was 26. I focused more on my career and once I felt settled, I joined a dating site and met my guy (we’ve been together for over 3 years). Don’t stress yourself…when the time is right, it’ll happen. I worried so much and looking back, I wish I hadn’t. I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be."
"Yes.  Why date until you are ready to marry?  I feel like I enjoyed a lot of great friendships and activities in high school and early college that I wound have missed out on had I been dating.  It’s not a time in life to add drama.  

I’m married 14 years now to a fantastic woman—my best friend.  We married young (very early 20s) and grew together as adults.  She’s the only person I’ve been physically intimate with. I wouldn’t change a thing except to treat her with more love and respect from the beginning.

Wait for love.  Date to marry."
"WORTH IT! I (f24) fell in love for the first time this year. It’s been amazing because we’re both old enough to know what we want and we grow together, learn together, etc. He (m26) and I moved in together a few months ago and I’m so glad I waited and held out for the perfect person- for someone who genuinely loves every part of me. You’ll find that person!!"
"It's over rated as fuck. Sex, love, relationships. All of it."
"I was 27. 

Don't worry, it's *never* too late.

I know people who married unhappily in their 20s, realised in their 30s after kids, and then in their 40s have to find their actual love."
I'm 20 F and I rejected every chance of being with a partner ever
"I’m still very young but from my experience I’ve had phases in my life where I’m extremely unhappy with myself (whether that’s my looks, body, grades, etc) and moments where all of those worries have been solved momentarily and I couldn’t be happier. I’m somewhere in the middle of that right now not really sure where but one thing I can promise you from my experience is that love worth your time comes without excessively seeking it. When I tried to pursue relationships because I was so unhappy with my life they all ended up shitty because I was desperate and I went for people that I liked but deep down knew weren’t right for me. I’ve only had one true love and I didn’t even try to find it, love found me in a weird way. It was the best part of my life and I’ve been single for a few years now and honestly I’ve had incredible ups and downs emotionally but when I focus on my own mental well-being, like feeling, looking and doing good (in school/work) I just find myself being presented with the situations by complete chance. Don’t rush love, anything worth your time can’t be forced and you’ll know when it’s really worth it. Also just try put yourself out there in more social situations, you’ll meet more people and whether it doesn’t seem like it matters now, everything aligns. Someone I met briefly a year ago during Halloween literately led me to meeting someone who I’m considering being in a relationship with and making friends. Even if it seems small pursue all the chances you have, cause you never know! Basically my message is, don’t rush it, don’t try too hard to seek it you’ll find the opportunity by taking care of yourself first (LOVE YOURSELF BEFORE ANYONE ELSE) and just try to be outgoing and include yourself in social interactions to make friends and meet new people. Not sure how helpful this is but this is the best I can give from my experiences and what I’ve made from them."
"My first real, reciprocated and lasting (more than 2-3 weeks) relationship started when I was 24. It lasted about 3 years and it was amazing (well, until the last few months).

It was a deep,romantic, almost-crazy love from both sides, especially at the beginning. Just as you'd imagine it.

So you're definetly not late with anything. As an advice though, be aware that in the first relationship you have, you'll have to figure out an insane amount of stuff about your feelings and yourself in general. It's very hard to control them, but you have to or other use you suffocate each other. So be patient with each other, and tell her to handle you lol."
"I had my first girlfriend at 22 years old.  Back when I was at high school and college, I thought that I would never have a girlfriend because I was socially awkward and clumsy. But alas, I was proven wrong. Try doing new things for yourself like building your hobbies to increase your self confidence.

Try also putting yourself into situations where you are expected to converse with the opposite gender or other people such as speed dating events, dating apps, and volunteer/charity/church groups. Good luck to you OP!"
I'll tell you as someone who fell in love early. Throw away any preconceived notions you have and focus on two things at your age. Fucking and learning what your needs are.
"Mine wasn't *that* late, I was 17, but it certainly felt late to me, and the relationship ended up being a total disaster because of it. I put so much weight into finally being in a relationship that I basically ignored all of the red flags that should've made me leave way sooner than I did."
"I would assume it's not worth it, having missed out on young love is a very hard pill to swallow.

Things just wouldn't be the same experiencing your first at such a late stage in life."
Always Love
"Yes, it's worth it. I didn't have my first relationship/sex till I was 21, so close to your age now. 

Previous to that I was frustrated with not being successful with dating. I worked on myself, gained some confidence, and started putting myself out there. Don't wait for it to come to you."
It's always worth it even when it's not
I didn’t get it till 26…
Whats that
"it takes times, usually the first love in high school isn’t love, it’s infatuation. i’ve been in relationships before, thought it was love but really it was just an unhealthy infatuation/obsession or lust , then got extremely hurt in the fall out. take your time with this stage in your life because infatuation can be great you get high off of it, but it can also kick you went your down. but once you find love (usually when you are not looking and you’ve done a lot of work on yourself) it’s amazing. and it doesn’t look like the movies .. it’s safe, comforting and feels like home"
"Looking for an honest genuine answer to anyone here: how do you make it to 35 y/o or similar and NOT ever had a date, partner or love experience? 

Is it severe lack of social skills, are you obscenely ugly? 

If you can talk and aren’t completely hideous, I’m sure anyone can find a partner by 35, no? 

I find almost all people are beautiful in some shape or form right?"
"25M I havent had a date in my life and at some point you just embrace the loneloness as part of who ulyou are. Fundamentally I know nothing is wrong with me but some days youll feel dowm becaise something is lacking in life seemingly. 

At the end of the day I can only work on myself.  So I try not to think about it too much. You just move forward right."
"Had all my first at 24, kiss, sex and relationship. Most definitely worth it but the process is always on going. Don’t give up, talk to people all the time and get comfortable with talking with everyone"
"100% worth it, man. It’ll sneak up on you faster than you think.  I was the friend no one ever wanted to date for a very long time, and all the heartbreak from that period was undone when it finally stuck. 

My best advice to you is to use this season to learn how to love people: that is, to seek their benefit, even if sometimes in spite of your own. Learn to do this freely, without bitterness, and with proper boundaries.

My next best advice for you is to get your life in order, get a good routine of hygiene and dress and organization to life, and stay/get out of debt. Do what you can to make life easier for the two of you when it happens. 

Women rejected me my whole life. When I was 21, I told myself I was just not the type of guy a woman would ever want, I wasn’t cut out for relationships and that I would be better off forgetting about romance and just trying to make the best life I could as a single man. I’m 27 now, my fiancé and I are planning to elope by the end of the year."
"I feel it’s all the more rewarding, the longer the wait. Also apparently those who meet their partner and marry when they’re a bit older tend to have longer lasting relationships. Also even if things don’t work out then it’s all good because you have the experience and know what you do and don’t want in a relationship :D it’s all about enjoying the process and growing as an individual."
"Any advice for me ? I have the ""sheltered while growing up"" problem too"
"Thank you , its the being ""socially active"" part O struggle with. I am kind of a loner so I despise social interactions and like being alone"
I am always confused whether I should try or just completely give up hope of having a partner
Congrats. This gave me hope
"Exactly the same thing man , I am always torn up between giving life a chance or just accepting I will always be alone and will die a lonely man in an old age lol"
"You are not done growing as a person, who you are today will not be the same person 10 years from now. You have plenty of time, enjoy your youth and freedom, to go anywhere and do anything without getting permission or compromising with another person. I was married at 21 and the worst thing that can happen is to be in your early thirties, finally confident and mature, sure of who you are and meet that special someone, The One, the One you should have waited for. It’s heartbreaking.True love will happen for you but until then enjoy just being you!"
"I’m 29 and have dated a lot and honestly you really shouldn’t let the media make you feel like you’re on the wrong path. Your twenties are for learning general life lessons, making mistakes and really learning who you are and developing a life based on what you want for yourself. True love should come after those things when you have your most fulfilled self only then should you add someone who naturally fits into that flow. The best things are worth waiting for and come when we least expect. 22-23 is exceedingly young you have so so much time. And honestly? You probably saved yourself a lot more trouble, potential trauma and heartache than you realize. I ended up in several abusive relationships that I didn’t realize were abusive until later in life and they completely shaped my life and sent me spiraling down a very bad path for a very long time. I’m jealous of people who are strong enough to be on their own."
"Hey thats three men in the boat brothers! Tho i believe things happen for a reason, and 23 is still fairly young"
"Most people aren’t living wonderful lives. That’s just the truth. Most people struggle one way or the other. Missed milestones. I didn’t go to my high school graduation because I couldn’t afford to buy the graduation cape. No I’m not kidding. I had good grades and was really looking forward to it but we were poor so I stayed home. I’m the only student missing from my graduation class picture. Didn’t go to my college graduation either because my father died, my mother couldn’t make it, the uniform was too expensive just for me to stand there alone without anyone clapping so I stayed home. As for early love. It left me heart broken. It’s not that you are missing out. It’s just that the possibility of being left completely heartbroken by your girlfriend or boyfriend is very real. It’s best to have someone you love. Truly love. A good friend is worth its weight in gold. As for intimacy that is much more important than sex. Aim to create intimacy with a woman. Not just sex. You’ll enjoy it more and be happier for it. Sex is meaningless when intimacy isn’t present."
"Honestly , you really haven’t lost much you know your 23 that’s still young. You have your whole life ahead of you. Love takes time, get to know yourself more in the meantime. When the time is right you will know."
I am kinda afraid to approach women first since I don't have anything to talk about most of the time and women would never approach me either so this becomes redundant process tbh
"I'm doing this but what kind of events are the best anyway, I'm attending this Chrsitian Ministires lol but this stuff is genuinely draining me, I not 100% interested in their mentality and views of god, I was actually taught Jewish traditions and stuff from my dad, but I don't know it's really hard lol, and sometimes I find myself drinking with only males, which totally drains me too, what are like the best places to meet women lol, I don't feel like hitting bars or anything yet lmao.

edit: this semester I also worked hard on these foreign language clubs, they were cool at first lots of women and stuff but they slowly stopped attending , to the point that is was  like AA of males, it's genuinely like the world was telling me, like no lol"
"I really didn’t think about it this much in depth but this is really true. My ex was a people pleaser and before me she complained about how her past 3 relationships all consisted of abuse and manipulation. After being with her for about a month it was more than clear to me that she was a complete people pleaser, she could never make a decision, never plan a date, never even had her own opinions on topics really and was just a boring person in general. It was clear that the last guys were manipulators and since she relied on having a bf at all times as she didn’t have much of a social circle she just walked straight into those relationships and I could only feel bad for her. Broke up and tried to support her afterwards but she went back to her older ways and downloaded tinder in a day. I tried to do the right thing and teach her to stand up for herself but who knows. 
TLDR - Ex was people pleaser and she was manipulated"

"""Met my wives and we were all married "" , is it the poly couple thing ?"
"What if I am not into marrying right ahead? What if I want to explore myself by going through variety of different relationships over the course of 10 years-ish? What if I don’t believe in locking my life with the person whom I may or may not be for real in-love with? 
But here I am at 23, just started to develop certain social skills, and still trying to gain some moral courage; whereas I am a cult survivor so I am not willing to let women take advantage of my upbringings & shortcomings."
Lmao... I've experienced both and adult love life can definitely be intense. How old are? Five?
Love is conditional.
"Just keep putting one foot in front of the other, basically, you'll get used to it. Although I'm happy to cover specific steps.

Framing matters as well--there's got to be a more neutral way to describe how you relate to social interactions besides saying that you despise them."
"Do you hate them because you dislike how other people act, or do you hate them because you don't know how to get to the parts you do like, like (guessing) having a deeper conversation about a topic? 

Because if you actually prefer alone time to being with other humans, then that leads to a very different set of actions than disliking social interactions because (for example) you don't know how to initiate your preferred ""good"" conversations or how to speak without being ignored"
"The best option for people like that is to join any group sports. You're focused on a common goal, so you have a topic to talk about. You can claim exhaustion if you don't want to hang out with them. And you can hang out with them if you want to. Although converting friends and acquaintances into romantic interests takes a lot of skill. I'm very bad at this, if I'm friends with someone, I'm just friends with them, my thinking is very binary. And do take online dating seriously, specially if you moved to someplace you don't know anyone. This is a generation gap thing, we think in internet, but people just 5 years older than me (I'm 29) don't. I think this is even more true for people 5-10 years younger than me. Of course, face to face meeting is important and really nice, but the virtual connection is also a connection. The person I talk most is someone who lives in another country. All my life, I've had internet friends, and they have been great comfort to me."
"Once someone said there are no introvertierts, there just confident and anxious people"
"I’m 35 and have never had a relationship or even a date. I’ve been told to focus on being happy with myself and when I stop looking then love will find me. I’ve yet to really learn to be happy or ok with myself so I can never find out if I will suddenly find love. I will say that I have semi given up, I’m still hoping I will find someone but I don’t really expect too. I would say keep trying, my situation is a bit different since I’m looking for a child free partner which severely limits the amount of girls around my age who feel the same. I’ve been in the position where I’ve both given up and lost hope at the same time and it was miserable. I keep a little bit of hope, that maybe just maybe it will happen for me in an attempt to stay sane."
Never give up hope but put effort into bettering yourself and mental health. Ppl are attracted to those who are happy and confident.
"Usually love finds you when u just dont expect it. Once you forget about it and live your life the way you want it potential partners will apppear, as people just love someone who can just live his/her life happily by themselves.  Dont give up hope, but also dont stress about it."
"Respectfully, why do those have to be your only two options? I’m almost 28 and have never been in love. And yeah, when I was younger I felt similarly to you. But I hit a point where I was like….I can’t keep up that mindset. It’s not healthy. So maybe you could just live your life? Go out with your friends, have fun, it might just happen naturally you know? If you meet someone you like, ask them out. Or maybe someone will ask you out. You don’t need to be actively seeking love to find it. And you don’t have to give up on it. It’s not one or the other."
"You're only 22, pretty early from many contexts (like Indian engineers). Personally, I'm 30 and never had any experience or much in terms of female friends. I'd say get out, roam around and live life unafraid at this age, you'll certainly meet someone. If you don't, so be it. At my age, perhaps due to stunted character development, I'm attracted to girls about 20- 25, but because of the massive age gap, I really can't even try to smile or do anything about it, so I'd say shoot your shots before you feel it's too late to"
"I will say there is life outside of romantic relationships, tho its really hard for me to believe sometimes too. It still really hurts to think that youll have to accept something like that, that goes against what all other humans do you know."
Go to church—one with a lot of young adults.  Grow close to God and find your wife while serving/volunteering.  The highest marriage happiness/satisfaction/success is found in the Christian Church
"I used to feel almost exactly the same way as you. There is a headspace you get into that you convince yourself is the whole truth that is hard to get out of. Ultimately the trap you set for yourself is just a mental trap. You can change the way you think about the whole thing by finding examples in your experience that disprove the idea that “you dont have anything to talk about”. The truth is you do have a lot to talk about, you just need to find out what it is you like talking about. If its talking about you that can b ok sometimes. Also sometimes you got to fake it until you make it. Keep asking people about themselves. Ask loads of questions and actually try to listen and understand what others are saying to you. Ask questions of people that you wish they would ask of you. It will get better"
"My advice, don't look for a future partner in a religious space especially if you aren't on board with the teachings. For me it was wasted time and lost friends when I eventually left.

Nothing against pursuing a faith, I just don't think it's a mentally healthy environment for young adults looking to date."

"> just sometimes I think am I doing the right thing by giving up on love by choosing to be alone all the time ?

Wrong thing. You should be ***patient*** but not ***give up***."
You got plenty of time.
"Yes, we’re all three together with each other."
"That was my (badly phrased) point. People hurry into relationships in their 20s. But if you expect to live into your 80s or 90s, then there's no reason to commit before you are ready, or worry about it otherwise.

There's as long as you need, if you find the right relationship at the end of it."

"If I had the power, I would put this before every romcom like those warnings on cigarette packets"
"I just want to add some context. Love is not always conditional. RELATIONSHIPS definitely are conditional. Relationships can and will end if you don’t listen to your partner, don’t empathize with them, and are not receptive to making change in your habits. The key to success in a relationship, I think, is to know what you want, and learn what your partner wants through open and honest communication. Don’t play games. Don’t make things complicated. If you feel something is wrong, ask. Most of all, validate your own feelings and your partner’s feelings. When you’re feeling anxious, confused, or combative, that’s okay, but try to approach conflict with the attitude of “I’m willing not to fight about this.”

Success in a relationship can be either a long-lasting good one or a breakup when needed. Breakups are success conditions because they end the relationship when it no longer works. No matter what, they’re for the best. 

I just wanted to make the distinction between love as a relationship and love as an ideal. You can love someone and break up with them because the relationship doesn’t work. I haven’t stopped caring for my exes."
"Lust is conditional, love is not"
"You are right maybe ""despise"" isn't the right word , I just enjoy my company too much and suck at small talk"
"I hate interactions not because I hate people,  just that I don't have anything to say most of the time while I feel others in the room can talk and giggle about anything all day. That makes me feel like incapable so I just go about my business not saying anything to anybody until I need to."
I am the latter. What do?
"I have the same issue. I used to be socially active, people hung out with me all the time. It's been 2-3 years of social isolation and I am super awkward now and can't find anything to say to people without feeling like I am hitting a wall. There are barely 1/2 people I can be free with and they live farr away. It doesn't help that I have never been open with my parents we have a complicated relationship..we love each other but never really talk freely and they fight all the time sometimes too toxic too. That has sort of brought me down in terms of confidence and ability to carry conversations freely. Even with people I really like, I find conversations to be a chore even though I'd love for it to free flow with them :/ I have no clue how to improve and become a confident quick on my feet person that can attract other people with my energy. Any tips would help please :)"
I don’t think this person knows the correct definition.
"Thank you for the honest advice , hope you find happiness in some form surely"
"Mostly true, with the caveat that this assumes the life you want will naturally lead you to interact with women. However, if you are (for example) a tech nerd living in Silicon Valley with mostly solitary or male-dominated hobbies then yea you'll have to make a considerable amount of effort to meet people outside of your normal social circle"
Thank you for the advice
"Nobody will ask me out that I am sure. I actually have no friends to hang out with either right now , I hope that changes when I move out next year though."
"To both of you I just want to say:

I'm someone that for so long, all I wanted was a girlfriend. To have someone love me, and to love someone back. It was foremost of my desires - I would have given anything for it. I thought my life would be so much better if I had a girlfriend.

Eventually I got my first girlfriend, someone whom I had pined over for years. I was ecstatic, and I thought things were going great. We continued on and eventually I just... Realized I wasn't as in love with her as I thought. She was a good girl, a nice person (she's married now and I'm happy for her), but after 5-6 months or so I just didn't feel the fulfilment I thought love would bring me. 

Since then I've fallen into a cycle of being single, wanting to be loved so badly, getting a girlfriend, and then never feeling what I thought I would or should. 

Of course, this says more about me than anything else. It's still something I'm working on, and realistically is something I should talk to a therapist about, but I just want to say not to romanticize the idea of love and being with someone. Sure, being in a relationship can be great, but just be sure to manage your expectations.

Love isn't going to make you feel complete. Accepting that you are complete as you are (or, alternatively, that you will never be complete and to always be working to better yourself) will be an important step to making sure you are someone that can be successful in love.

That's the end of my big block of text that no one asked for. Hopefully you can find something akin to wisdom in the ramblings of a single guy with a few drinks in him"
This is terrible advice. And the last sentence is hilariously untrue.
😂😂😂😂😂
"Oh man this hits home really hard, I know better to learn from experiences of others rather than figuring out by myself  wasting precious time, thanks for the advice, hahaha."

"A bit off topic. But do you identify yourself as an incel? If yes, do you have any Discord servers you could recommend with a lot of incel's? I've been wanting to talk to them."
Both are conditional
You can also use someone emotionally.
"I'm a bit like you in that I'm not very comfortable with small talk. But I do enjoy having long conversations about subjects I'm interested in. It helps to have a variety of interests too.

In my primary social circles, I sometimes feel a bit lost as these are not just my friends but also my wife's. I have cultivated a few longterm friendships over the years though. These are friends with whom I can have really wonderful conversations and, interestingly enough, they mostly happen over the phone because we're not in the same city.

I think it helps to put out your interests in any social situations in which you find yourself. Talk about an article or book on the subject that you read recently. Ask people what they think about a particular topic that you are interested in. You can initiate conversations this way. And if there are others in the group who find these subjects interesting, it gives them a chance to connect with you."

"A good book to start with is ""how to make friends and influence people""  perhaps you can find a free pdf or someone narrating the book to listen to."

"I'm a bad person to ask because I am a genuine introvert, I can spend entire day inside my head day dreaming. What has helped me is to have a list of topics inside my mind that are conversation starters. The same question, presented differently, can be either small talk or a genuine conversation starter. And I also ask specific questions. So I usually ask, what was an experience you have enjoyed lately, or where have you been going for vacations. People love talking about themselves. I also have an active imagination, so I ask absolutely bonkers questions. I had a meeting recently where I knew nobody (I was representing the engineering part of the task, but normally it's not an engineering meeting). Everybody was asking how are you and things like that. I was very tired, so in stead of saying that, I said that I felt like a zombie, and then I asked if I turned into one, what should I do first. Should I call the emergency or should I go eat my neighbor? People laughed, they started discussing it and it broke the ice. I now have people I nod to in the office, or say hi, thanks to that zombie question.

tl;dr - prepare a list of topics beforehand, ask questions that are not routine and regular, ask for suggestions. In my experience, these help a lot."
"No problem, i know it's tough mate, but hey, gotta trust in the future"
"I know it’s hard, but patience leads to acceptance. And once you move, things could change- stay positive about that. Additionally, work on your confidence a little bit. I know it sounds ridiculous, but telling yourself over and over that you’re good looking and likable and whatever positive thing you can think of DOES help. It boosts that confidence. So just stay calm and be patient."
"Fucking hell dude, I asked for that"
"I appreciate this a lot. I used to think a lot that love would solve everything, but I have a lot of time recognizing that a lot of what I want in a relationship, from love, can be fulfilled, perhaps better, from a tribe, just a group of friends, and just working on bettering myself, and as such thats my focus now. One thing I still struggle with, and perhaps i can pick your brain a bit (after a few more drinks of course) is dealing with feeling like you just aren't desirable. Realizing that no one has ever looked at me and thought 'oh hes cute', and its likely no one ever will, is probably the most painful pill to swallow. This doesn't come as easily from those replacements as other attributes."
"No this is not some big block of text , genuinely very good advice. Thank you so much"
Why?
Plenty of time -1
It's ticking. But there's no hurry. Plenty of time...
"I'm involuntarily celibate, it has nothing to do with identifying as one. This isn't like gender or whatever. It's either you've tried to get a GF or sex as a guy without a prostitute but have failed and that's all an involuntarily celibate is. 

And no I don't join any of those discord servers. I just go on with life and occasionally I'll watch some black pill content on YouTube. My favorite channels are FaceAndLMS, jacked and stacked, and wheat waffles. The it's complicated channel is also good."
Sure
"Obviously it's cliche to say, but things like ""being cute"" aren't that important to being desirable. It's all about how you carry yourself. Being conventionally attractive helps of course, but in the grand scheme of being desirable the kind of person you are will be what is most important.

There are plenty of cute people out there that are crippled by their own doubt of themselves, be it with a relationship or not turning enough heads on the street or whatever. Wouldn't they all be better off just living their life like normal - being the person they are - however desirable that might make them?

Cute or not, it's the same for everyone. All the flash aside, your flavor of human is what will be remembered and is what will make you desirable or not in the long run. The attractive person gets looked at twice, the likeable person gets looked at every day.

And one last little cliche before I head in for the night, remember: beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Thankfully this world is full of beholders, with all sorts of different preferences"
"Your post history (a frequent in the dead bedroom sub I see) is evidence enough as to how christian-based marriages are *not* the highest in happiness/satisfaction/success. In my opinion, many christian-based marriages are rife with lies, shame, unhappiness, an inability to properly communicate, misogyny and, of course, a whole lot of sweeping shit under the rug. 

But good for you if your christian marriage blessed by a magic man in the sky has fulfilled all you hoped it would. I hope you get laid at least once in 2023. In fact, I'll even pray for you!"

"Can confirm. 
Suffered from ""ugly duckling syndrome"" and even when I did grow into someone conventionally attractive I didn't know how to connect past a superficial level for YEARS. I was a very bitter teenager not understanding how people thought I was attractive but never wanted to be with me."
"That depends entirely on how you spend the years. 

If you interpret ""plenty of time"" as ""I can continue what I'm doing indefinitely without any changes and eventually something will happen"", then yeah the years will fly by. If you interpret it as ""there's plenty of time, so taking a small step today is enough. I can climb the mountain of tasks/changes I must make before I run out of time, even if I do it the slow way. I don't need a savior to reach down and carry me instantly to the top, because there's plenty of time to hike it. I haven't already failed because I waited too long to start"", you'll have a much happier and more fulfilling and less miserable life, regardless of the outcome."
Looking at your profile you sound like a really miserable person.
Honesty for what lol
"But once you're a certain age you can't really do anything to get a relationship anymore, it just kind of becomes ""over"" at some point"
Doesn't invalidate what I said
For the incel part I mean.
And what age is that? 94? When you are on your deathbed? Keep your doomer mindset to yourself.
That's nonsense. One can meet people and get into a relationship at any age.
"Really? What age? My grandfather got a girlfriend at age... 81? 20 years younger than him too. Real cradle robber, him.

It wasn't his first, this was some years after his wife died, but I think the point still stands"
I wouldn't put too much trust in an incel's judgment of reality.
"I'm talking about a guys first, it becomes too late at some point"
Good response man hahahaha
Doesn't invalidate what I said
Do you believe you already passed that point and it's too late for you?
"Actually it does. No one sensible trusts an incel. If you having an hard time understanding that look at the votes.

Now go back to your cave or get help. We're not interested in hearing your negatively just because you think your life suck."

"Yes they do, that's because people can't really tell who's one and who isn't"

You need to eat some shrooms

"Just cope, do other things. Until I get old enough to the point where life doesn't have much of a point anymore since I wouldn't have a family or grandkids. So I'd probably just off myself by then."
They're poisonous
"I get the feeling you're really struggling to let go of the idea of finding a romantic relationship. Do you have any friends or family who can give you a sense of intimacy without being in a romantic relationship?

I didn't get my first experience until I was 25, so I 100% understand the fear. You haven't experienced a romantic relationship, so you really have no idea what it's like, how it goes, what is necessary to get started in one, what's necessary to be successful in one, and how easy or difficult it may be. And if I tell you something that's 100% true and also a reason to hope you may get the thing one day, or the experience of people who lost their virginity at even later ages, you're in enough pain that you won't believe that it's true, or that your life operates on different rules in some way.

So, when was the last time you got a hug?"
The trip will do you good brother. It will cleanse your soul of your doom and gloom mentality.
">Do you have any friends or family who can give you a sense of intimacy without being in a romantic relationship?

I live with my parents still

And yes I'm trying to fully give up, but it's a bit of a challenge. Stupid monkey brain won't fully let go of hope and attraction for girls.

>You haven't experienced a romantic relationship, so you really have no idea what it's like, how it goes, what is necessary to get started in one, what's necessary to be successful in one, and how easy or difficult it may be

Correct, I've experienced nothing. Not even a kiss or touched a girl.

>And if I tell you something that's 100% true and also a reason to hope you may get the thing one day, or the experience of people who lost their virginity at even later ages, you're in enough pain that you won't believe that it's true, or that your life operates on different rules in some way

I just don't think there's a point in experiencing that once I'm old. Here's why:

1. Most women have already had that experience and they stupidly take it for granted to the point where it pisses me off.

2. Relationships will be mostly transactional at that point, everything will revolve around a guys wealth, his job, his house, etc. Very little importance on the actual ""personality"" part. No longer will the relationship consist of the bowling, county fair or simple star gazing dates the younger couples would have.

3. There's a very high chance I'd just be the last pick that the woman settles for once she's done dating the much more attractive guys than me. There would never be an attraction as strong as the ones she had in her youth. 

If anything, if we do end up being intimate she'd probably fantasize about the times she was with those better guys than me.

Right now I can't really do shit until I move out since women view guys living at home as inferior people, which means that I will have missed out on dating in my youth.

>So, when was the last time you got a hug?

😂😂 How is this relevant?"
"I'm not a druggie, plus they're illegal"
">How is this relevant?

Because you said a bunch of things that makes me think you hate yourself, and you may be starving for some basic human intimacy and compassion and acceptance, but because you've been starved of it you don't know what the sources are for it besides romantic relationships.   
And because you're in pain, you've crafted a world view based on a LOT of assumptions that brings you to the conclusion that it's not your fault and there's no point trying. A worldview where the failure was out of your hands, as a shield to protect yourself from the shame of accepting responsibility for your fate, because it's less painful to get screwed by the world than it is to try,  and still fail to achieve what you were told is ""good enough""

If you want to REALLY give up? To really let go of the idea of finding a romantic relationship? Mourn the loss of who you thought you could have been but can't ever be because you missed your chance, forgive yourself for failing to achieve that ideal self, accept who you are as good enough, and then do stuff with your life that you find fulfilling, for its own sake, regardless of what anyone thinks of what you did.

For the record, this is extremely hard. It's MUCH easier if you have some bros or family who can give you a hug when you're feeling hurt and tell you you're okay just the way you are. 

So when's the last time you got a hug from someone who accepts you as good enough, as you are right now, in spite of everything you feel regret and shame for not doing?"
Enjoy your self-limiting mind then.
">that brings you to the conclusion that it's not your fault and there's no point trying

There is no point in trying, didn't you read the points I made?

>forgive yourself for failing to achieve that ideal self, accept who you are as good enough

I can do everything minus those two, I will always see myself as a failure and a pathetic excuse of a guy (not a man). And that's okay.

>So when's the last time you got a hug from someone who accepts you as good enough, as you are right now, in spite of everything you feel regret and shame for not doing?

What kind of question is this lmao I don't fucking know"
Lol because I'm not a druggie?
">What kind of question is this lmao I don't fucking know

I'm noticing that you laughed at it instead of answering. Have you ever gotten a genuine hug of emotional support from someone who accepts you as good enough?"
No because statements like “I’m not a druggie” are very close-minded and close-minded people stay the way they are because they’re close-minded.
"I already told you my family has hugged me, I laugh because it's a corny question."
"Okay, I don't do drugs. Is that better?"
"Alright, better question.

Do you love yourself? Do you think you're good enough even though you still live with your parents and never had a girlfriend?"
"Sure, have you seen the research behind how psychedelics help depression and anxiety? 

I see it as a tool for improvement. It’s definitely opened my eyes for a better life and I only had to do it once. I just hope you can find a way to help yourself get out of the black pill rut."
">Do you think you're good enough even though you still live with your parents and never had a girlfriend?

Fuck no 😂"
"That's a very important point.Do you want to know how to give up on having a girlfriend and move on with your life?  


Because there's ways. It's hard, but doable."
"I'm sure castrating myself might be part of it, but I don't want to lower my t levels"
"Answer this question, sincerely, without joking, and then forgive yourself. Not to me, not right here, just in general. This will take a while and is the sort of thing therapists normally help with, but there's a youtube channel that can DRAMATICALLY help with the process.

Why does living with your parents and being single at age 25 mean you're not good enough?"
"I like that channel, I used to watch it while I played COD or fifa. I think I've seen all of those but just kind of forgot the basic talking points he made.

And forgive myself for what?

>Why does living with your parents and being single at age 25 mean you're not good enough?

Multiple reasons:

1. I didn't go through the pivotal point in maturing in my young years of dating and seeing what it's like.

2. I haven't accumulated a good enough wealth at my age especially for my expectations based on the career/field/areas I went to school for.

3. I'm simply behind the majority of my peers and a good chunk of it is my fault in the career part.

4. I won't ever experience young love, many other things young guys experience. That ship sailed and there's no going back.

Those are the ones I came up with, I'm sure there's more"
">And forgive myself for what?

Do you not blame yourself for any of the things you listed below? Because if you truly don't blame yourself for them, I can't imagine why it's difficult for you to let go of any of it and move on with your life, or why you have the thought ""I'm not good enough"", and why that thought causes you any distress at all"

"Was visiting my parents with my husband. They live in the countryside and me and him decided to go for a walk at night, look at the stars and all that. It’s maybe 11pm. 

So we walk for a bit, reach the top of a big hill and lean on a gate looking over a field. Pretty stars, moon out, no torches. We’re there for maybe 5 minutes when I spot a man walking slowly across the field towards us. 

The guy doesn’t have a torch, which seems super weird to me. Like, we didn’t bring one but we’re walking along the roads and there’s a bit of light from the moon. The only reason a man would be walking in the field would be if he was out checking his livestock, which you would definitely need a torch for. 

He’s just slowly walking straight across the field at us and I can’t think of any reason for him to be there. I ask my husband, do you see that guy? He says yes. I say what’s he doing, my husband says “I don’t know” then shouts hello and waves at the guy. (Why???)

Nothing. Doesn’t slow down, doesn’t wave, doesn’t say anything. Just keeps walking straight towards us. 

Husband shouts hello again. No response again. I’m fucking terrified and assuming this dude is a lunatic and we need to run. 

And then the guy turns slightly to the side and...is a horse. Turns out at a distance in the dark, the shape of a horse walking directly towards you looks exactly like the outline of a person."
"I opened my bedroom door one night to go and fill up my water bottle. At the other end of the corridor I saw a strange shadowy silhouette - a few feet tall, dark, and it felt like it was looking at me.

I'm immediately alarmed, but just stare for a second, until it starts moving. Straight towards me.

I (at the time, a twenty year old man) screamed like a little girl on a rollercoaster when it began to run at me.

Turns out my sister went outside to smoke and a random greyhound just showed up and let itself in. I'll always remember the bonechilling pitter-patter of its creepy little paws."
"The time I woke up to find an intruder in my bedroom, standing beside my bed looking down at me. I chased him out and wasn't physically harmed but the police were certain that, despite him taking a number things, I was actually the real reason he broke in and that waking up when I did saved me from rape or worse because it startled him."
"I had two stories but had to post them separately as the other was long

A few years back I was walking in a city with my mum and little sister, I was about 12 and my sister 5 I think. Everything was fine, birds were chirping and kids were playing and people were just shopping having a great day but then all of a sudden mum grabs my little sister and tells me to run in the direction we just came. 

I didn't have a clue as to what was going on but I listened to her and ran she then stopped and told another mum with two small kids that something was coming but I didn't hear what the something was I couldn't even see or hear anything but the birds, kids playing and people shopping.

The other mum joined us and we all hurried into a computer shop. About 5 minutes later a very very large group of people rioting came walking passed they were shouting, swearing and there were things being thrown about cars were also being smashed.

My sister was crying her eyes out and I remember my mum trying to keep her quite the shop owner gave her a balloon which calmed her and then he locked the door and turned the lights out. It lasted for 20 minutes but in those 20 minutes its like the whole city went dark all I could hear and see through the door was the riot nothing else.

We waited about 20 minutes after it had passed just in case they came back and then mum took us home."
"I used to live in this shitty little apartment in a shitty neighborhood. Just three streets over boasted the first murder of the year just after midnight on New Year’s Day! Anyway, the place was above a restaurant and the dumpster was right up against the wall of the building. From there, you could absolutely hop right on top and gain access to the first floor roof which happened to be right outside my bedroom window. 
One day, I noticed there was an EYE traced into the grime on the outside of the window. 

I started sleeping in the living room after that with a hammer."
"A few years ago, I was home alone with my sister (I was 14 she was 13) and my parents and siblings went out for ab 6 hours. Me and my sister were sitting at the TV watching Dr. Phil and we here a lock.. all our doors were locked so I was confused. I checked the house and found nothing. The next night I'm in my room walking around in booty shorts and a sports bra. I here a click sound. I thought nothing of it and layed on my bed that faced the window and went on my phone. I hear another click. I put on a t-shirt and I go to my window and I slam on it. A guy with a fucking camera was hiding and he bolted. I screamed for my dad and he realized what happened and he went after the guy and the dude was caught. Turns out he had multiple pics of me over the course of 2 months of me sleeping, showering, and changing along with multiple pics of other underage girls. So of course he got arrested. That was by far the creepiest experience. I'm 17 now and I still get a pit in my stomach when I tell the story and I always feel watched"
"I was at a night club with a friend and this guy came over and started talking to me. We spoke for about thirty minutes. During that time, he kept asking where do I live. I would give vague answers because I didn’t feel comfortable telling him. He seem too personal in asking questions. As my friend and I were leaving, he seen what type of car I was driving and just waved bye and went back in the club. A week later, I was leaving for work and found flowers in my car with no note. This was in 1982 when nobody locked there car door.  The following week , I found a card in my car stating that he found out were I lived and sat in my car for four hours hoping I would come out so he can see me. I noticed my personal items missing from car as well. He said he didn’t feel comfortable coming to the door due to my parents were home. This was creeping me out. I locked my car the first time scared what I may see next him probably laying down in my backseat. He wrote another note that he was pissed that I started locking my car doors and left it on windshield. The following week he busted my window out that is when I got the police involved."

"When I was really little, between 2 and 3 judging by what house this took place in, I turned in my bed and saw my father laying in a plank position. He was balanced perfectly on top of the flimsy plastic safety rail. My father is a disabled veteran and at the time he could barely walk without a cane. But he was just laying there, perfectly balanced, on an inch thick plastic rail. His arms were rigid against his side, his eyes were open and staring up, and his mouth was gaping. I got freaked out so I got out of bed and his eyes shifted and looked at me while the rest of him was completely still. I ran into my parents room, where my father was asleep in bed.

I'm convinced this was sleep paralysis at a young age. Several other events have happened throughout my life and I still get hypnagogic auditory hallucinations when falling asleep each night."
"Woke up not being able to breathe and realized there was a hand over my mouth. Then I felt the sharp knife in my back and heard someone whispering in my left ear ""Shut up, shut up, shut up..."" A guy had climbed in my New York apartment and wanted to get everything he could. He thought I had a roommate in my loft above, but I didn't. We were alone.  
   
Somehow, once I was completely awake and not paralyzed with fear -- which miraculously only took a couple seconds -- I was able to act very calm. I acted like this happens every day that someone climbs in my window at 5 a.m. In the middle of his ""visit,"" his energy turned and I could tell he was considering raping me. I had a very bizarre experience of being present in my body AND feeling like I was high up on my ceiling looking down at myself.   
   
Once I had that very bizarre ""big picture"" view somehow -- even though this guy was strung out on drugs and had a knife -- I felt like I would be OK and I was able to talk him out of the rape.  
   
I was actually very calm and collected all morning, through the experience, through the cop visit, and even through the guy calling me, after the cops had left, to threaten my life (once he found out the ATM card code I had given him was wrong).   
   
I even went to my morning workout. I wanted to get out of the apartment and thought a workout would help shift my energy. In the middle of the workout I sort of collapsed, as the adrenaline wore off.   
   
Even though I was calm, cool, and collected that was one hell of a scary event."
"When I was around 6-7 my dad gave me this giraffe toy that swayed its head around and sang this song called ‘naranja dulce, limón partido’ (this was from when I used to live in Colombia)

I thought nothing of it first, but when I was trying to go to sleep at night, I’d hallucinate that the giraffe would slowly turn it’s neck to look at me.

Whenever that happened, I wasn’t able to move or scream. I felt locked in the position that I was in. I think it lasted like a minute or two, but it felt like hours.

Years later, I realize it was sleep paralysis."
"When I was 7 years old I was home sick and my mom was there to take care of me. She went out to buy some breakfast and left me alone at home with our home-phone and her number in case something happened. I was sitting in our living room playing Bakugan on my Xbox 360 when I heard very heavy footsteps from the stairs about 5-6 meters to my right, I didn't think much of it assuming my mom had come home even though I hadn't heard anyone open or close the door(it's very loud). There were these glass ""windows"" that you could see parts of the stairs from our living room. When someone walked up or down you would always see them. The steps got louder and louder as they should but it sounded like it was a very large and heavy person(even larger than my dad who was at work at the time). I couldn't see anyone through the glass and when ""it"" got to the top of the stairs the sound stopped, like something was standing there, looking at me and I suddenly felt really sick, like very sick. Then I heard the steps again and they faded away the further down they got. That's when I started to cry and shake like I've never done before. I grabbed the phone and called my mom. She hurried home when she heard me sobbing on the phone under my blanket. Never had a scary experience since, or at least as scary. I live in Sweden and now later on when I asked my dad about the history of our house he said that it was an old Police station in the 1940s. Others in my house now, like my step-mom, step-sister and even my mom when I ask her about it, have all had creepy experiences and are convinced that there is someone else in there, something else. My dad said that it was the old wooden steps creaking but it's not possible for them to do it one by one, that consistently and loud, up and down. I don't really believe in ghosts but I still can't explain what happened.

tl;dr: When I was 7 years old i was home alone and heard very heavy footsteps going up and down the stairs."
"When I used to live in Japan I always felt safe. But there was this incident one night I can't shake out of my mind. Was waiting for a friend around this apartment building just chilling, when I saw just a regular guy smoking a few feet away from me. Not weird about that. So Im just on my phone when I feel a presence. Look up, then it's that guy wearing a suit, pants pulled down and touching himself furiously right in front of my face. I jumped up and dropped my phone between his legs, trying to push him away to run when he grabs my arm. Luckily another man nearby saw this and scared him away. Terrified of what could have happened if that man didn't interfere..."
"Not one incident, but about a hundred. For about a 3 year span, I would have a light bulb burn out over my head about once a week. Not turn off, but completely burn out. It even happened twice on one drive home about 7 miles apart. I have witnesses of as many as 5 bulbs burning out over my head in one night."
"When i was like 7 or 8 years old i was at a pool with some guys i knew, one of them got agressive rather quickly and he was at the time like 10cm taller than me and easily stronger. So we decided to throw one of those toys that you throw in the water and then dive for them.  We raced there and i was a split second faster and he got angry because he thought i'd ripped it out of his hand. He tried to drown me and pushed my head down multiple times before keeping me under water. I legit thought i was going to drown. I had nightmares about drowning for multiple years after that"
"I'd just got hold of my first car a few years back, and took it out to the country lanes to drive fast and just generally mess around.

It was around 7pm and just getting dark, after half an hour of wheelspin and speeding, I pulled over to reply to messages and browse Reddit in my new car. I looked up in my rear view mirror and saw a man around 6ft crouched just enough for me to make eye contact, with a black canvas mask and his hood up, just watching me with wide eyes.

He noticed I'd seen him and made a grab for my drivers door, luckily I'd locked it. I floored the car and drove home so quickly. Never been back. Fuck that shit."
"We had a ""peeping Tom"" that would secretively work his way around neighborhood properties at night.

He held a flashlight and coffee can in his hands. People would notice him looking in bedroom windows and ""lingering"" there.

When someone would call him out on it, he'd say ""I'm a fisherman - out looking for *nightcrawlers*.""

When finally caught by the police, the peeping Tom became known as ""The Nightcrawler."" A few months later, he was apprehended again, looking in his *favorite* (house with attractive females) bedroom windows while pretending to be grabbing worms for the next day's fishing."
"I was 11 years old. I was playing basketball at a court by myself. Just getting some practice in. This car pulls up by the court, parks, and then sits there. Nothing happens for the next 30 mins as I’m shooting around. Then I get my stuff to get up and leave. Immediately, the car turns on as I do. I get on my bike and start riding away. The car starts following me on a road, tailing me slowly (the car could have easily passed me). I knew some shortcuts around so I started going towards them. This was a shortcut where I knew the car wouldn’t be able to follow me. As I go up this dirt path, I hear I car door open. I never biked so hard in my life. Terrifying"
"ooh, there were many incidents happened at one of our rented flats back when I was a teen. 
My sister and I were babysitting our cousin's kids, aged 10, 6 and 3 respectively. The youngest was one of the brightest and the most polite kid you could ever meet. So, there we were getting ready for bed and he asked for some water. I lifted him up, took him to the table outside the kitchen. Now, we always had the window open in there and this window took 3/4 of the wall. From where we both were standing/sitting, that window was  to my right in the kitchen. It was almost sunset. The kid was sipping water, I was looking at his face, may be talking about something I dont remember what (he has ridiculously long and beautiful eyelashes so I often caught myself looking at them). I saw his eyes moved towards the window and becoming wide,  his face lost color, all of this happened in a split second and he said, ""that black man""..I looked towards the window ,ofcourse there was no one, we lived on the second floor. I enquired about what did he just say, his face still horrified,eyes never leaving the window. ""The black man tried to smash the window with his axe, he couldn't and ran away to the other building(the one adjacent to ours)"". I soothed him by saying along the line of, he got nothing to worry about, we are all here with him. There was no way he could make this up, he never lied.  I am very strong nerved and rarely get rattled but this shook me good enough that I couldn't sleep that whole night."
"Drove through downtown St. Louis. My parents were lost. three men in masks posed as construction workers (no trucks or road work signs) walked up to the car and started to walk around the SUV and tried to open all fours doors. 

We were all petrified as we were blocked in by the cars in front of us and behind us. I've always assumed they were in on it. They all had masks of some kind. 

Two homeless men full on sprinted towards the car and Sparta kicked the fuck out of two of them and fucking destroyed them. We could hear the dry heaving. They then proceeded to fuck up the other one. 

After they ran off my dad asked what was that and apparently the three men would pose as workers then rape the women in the cars that stopped. They would drag them out and rape them on the street. My dad asked the homeless men to get in the car and we took them to get food at the White Castle and dropped them at a grocery store with 100 dollars cash. I had never been so fucking scared in my life. It both destroyed my faith in humanity and restored it. 

They were both Vets. Let's get our vets taken care of better, people. Their sense of duty doesn't go away (in most cases). 

I'll never forget that night or the gutteral sounds they made after getting dropkicked. I'm a lower middle class white kid from Alabama, so it was an experience I had never seen being in shitty places in St. Louis.

But hey"
A blank whit van with graffiti on the back drove by me and a friend and stopped just ahead so jokingly my friend said “here’s where we get kidnapped” and just then the van began to reverse to us so upon seeing this we turned and ran as fast as we could away from that van.
"My sister and I were recently checking out of an old hotel in the countryside we’d been staying at for our dad’s wedding. We had come back to the room after breakfast to pack our things away and, as my sister was unlocking the door, we both looked to our left into the stairwell. There, heading down the stairs, were two middle aged women. The first blonde like me, the second brunette like my sister. And both wearing the same outfits as us. The exact same. Right down to the buttons on my skirt. Obviously, they got down to the reception first and my grandparents thought they were us until they noticed they were older. Still waiting to be black bagged for finding our older doppelgängers"
"When I was in college when I was around 19 I would meet my mum and gran for dinner. While they waited for me in this indoor market an older guy approached them and they started talking. After a while he began joining them every time he saw them in the market.

The first time I met the guy I just felt uneasy being near him but I didn't know why so I ignored it. After a while he started acting creepy like waiting away from my mum and gran until I walked in then he would act like he just got there even though he'd been waiting for like 20 minutes. I arrived one day to see him sat with my mum and gran but my mum and gran looked different they were both angry but also looked like they wanted to flee their body language was just off.

I walked up to them and greeted them, they all replied I then went to take my bag off but my mum asked in a voice that didnt sound like her normal self do you want to go eat somewhere else today, sensing something was wrong I agreed.

Once we left the market and my mum knew the guy wasn't following us she told me the guy had been asking a few questions about me lately they were getting creeped out but didn't think the questions had become severe enough yet because it was mostly about what I do at college and what movies do I like but then just before I walked in he was asking questions like do I have a boyfriend, do I want one, do I like music because he makes music and he can make me a song if I want him too.

There was also some other questions but my mum and gran wouldn't say what they were. We ended up completely avoiding him and chose to eat somewhere else for dinners just so we wouldn't run into him. He was also asking about me all the time never talking about anything else just me.

I ended up running into him one time when I was walking with a friend but because I had told my friend who was a tall guy about  the creepy guy he pretended to be my boyfriend. After that I've never seen the creeper again its like he vanished I've even been going in the market and haven't seen him once. 

Just ignore any grammer or punctuation mistakes I'm tired 😂"
"One time I was taking a crap, and an earthquake hit causing the toilet to shake so much, I thought it was going to shatter underneath me."
"Last year, in 2018, I decided to go for a walk at night in my neighborhood.  It was a boring day in summer so I thought I could use some fresh air from being cooped up in my house for a while.  The cool air was so refreshing and the evening light was so pretty.  I actually felt physically and mentally great for the time I was walking.

After the 15 to 20 minute mark into my walk, I noticed this guy just sitting on his porch.  At this point in time the sun went down and street lights were on.  (Note, I am a Male and 16 at the time this took place.)  This guy picks up a backpack and just goes down the same street as me.  I really didn't think much of it until I turned right on a neighborhood street intersection where he did the same.  Adrenaline kicked in, I started to shake and I felt more aware of everything around me.  As to why I started feel scared is that people RARELY walk on the streets, especially at night, so nobody was out except me and him.

I eventually sped up my pace and started back home.  Scarily, he also sped up.  I started to freak out but I tried not to show it.  My house was only a block away and when I believed I was out of sight, I hauled it to my front door.  I immediately locked my doors and tried to think if I was being paranoid or not.  I wasn't because he walked passed my house. (My house is on a side street and not on the main road)  

I don't know if I could have been robbed or something else but never the less it was scary for me."
"One night i was putting my 4 year old son to bed and about a hour later he asked if he could sleep in my bed so i let him. After tucking him in and wishing him ""goodnight"" he then asked me - "" who is the man wearing the black sweater behind you in the hall""

Me and my son live alone"
"First, some backstory: When I was younger, I volunteered at a charity that rehabilitated birds of prey.  Given that we had a large number of carnivores, and that not every animal brought to us for rehabilitation survived, we had a large number of corpses and corpse chunks that needed disposing of.  The normal waste disposal people wanted no part of this, so we had a deal worked out with the local veterinary teaching hospital to take our body part related waste items. The bin they had allocated specifically for us was all the way on far side of the large refrigerated room they kept corpses in while they awaited disposal or necropsy. 

One day, when it's my turn to take the waste over, I open the massive steal double doors, and am greeted with dozens and dozens of skinless horses hanging from the ceiling from the chains/winches they use to transport huge corpses around the path department with. They are so densely packed that there is no way I'm going to be able to reach the bin on the other side without  squeezing through and rubbing up against skinless corpses.  13 year old me really does not want to do this thing, but can see no other way to reach the bin allocated...no other way that is, except walking along the edges of the various other body part bins that line the right hand wall. 

On the way to the bin, the walk across the edges of the bins goes as planned.  I almost lose my balance once or twice, but I make it to my bin and drop the bag of bird and prey body parts in it.  Relieved, I turn around, step to the nearest bin, and slip...directly into a bin filled with disembodied dogs heads.  To set the scene correctly, there's me, fully inside a metal bin about the shape and size of a small dumpster, just sprawled a top a literal \*pile\* of dog heads.   


To answer the inevitable question of ""why was there a bin full of dog heads?"" the short answer is rabies.  If you suspect an animal has rabies, you need to send the brain away for testing.  Most local vets wouldn't be able to safely and correctly remove a brain for FAT testing in a local clinical, so they just send in the entire head.  I had fallen into the rabies head bin."
"So, me and my brother were home alone one night. I was like 5-7 years old. In elementary school at the time. The house we lived in had a basement where you could enter the basement through stairs as well. Anyway, it was late and I was walking passed the basement door when I noticed the door handle turning. I froze for a moment and decided to look through the keyhole. Now, I dont remember if I exactly saw his eye looking at mine or just the guys shadow, but I freaked out. Also, I remained calm luckily while getting my brother and whispering to him. He ended up grabbing a bat I think and started to yell. I knew he called the police too, but my memory is in pieces. And it is one of the reasons, I am scared of the dark/basements that aren't accessed through the house only."
"This was 90% my fault, but I have a vivid memory of a night I spent homeless in montreal.

Im from Ontario, and I was in Montreal, and it was late, so ai decided to spend the night with my sleeping bag in Mount Royale (?) park. There were so many trails in it, it was hard to find a decent patch of woods to lay low and sleep. When I was trying to sleep, i heard pitter patter all around me. I figured it COULD be a raccoon, but seemed like people, walking, in circles, on all those paths all around me. I couldnt sleep!

I got up and packed up and found a bench under a streetlight to collect my thoughts, where was I going to sleep? I was so freaked out I had my pocketknife open and under my leg.

A man walked up, about 50 years old. He asked in French ""Are you waiting for someone?"" And I answered with what I thought meant ""No, i think someone is following me"" (i.e. im scared) but instead the direct translation would be ""No, Im waiting to see if someones waiting/looking for me""

The man put his hand on my leg, and I almost took my hand out from under my leg, with my knife in it. But instead I just looked scared and said ""I dont know whats happening!"" And he kindof looked concerned and walked off.

I then hung out in a doorway and drew, I couldnt sleep. At 5am a woman with scars all over her face asked me if I wanted a blowjob for $20. I said no...

I later found out that the park I was in was a gay walking area. The creepiest experience of my travels turned into an almost funny joke!"
"I'm working midnight shift and can watch movies most nights. Last night I'm watching the movie 1408, the movie about the haunted hotel room . I'm at the part of the movie when some sketchy shit happened. the fax machine phone in my office starts fucking ringing at almost the same time the phone on the movie rings. When I answer the fax machine phone all I get is dial tone... then a fax comes in and until I read what was on the fax I was shitting bricks.  I enjoy watching horror movies on these shifts makes work....more exciting."
One time a woke up to a  spider the size of my hand and it was right near my door so it took a bit to have the courage to go out.....I slept with it in my room basically it was watching me.
"When I was 12, I was taking a shit in a Burger King bathroom stall, when mid shit a middle aged Indian man put his head under the door and made the bj motion with his hand and mouth. I froze and just said fuck off and he left the bathroom. The fact I was mid shit when this happened to me stopped it ever becoming in any way traumatic lol"
"I was on a business trip, finished a group dinner downtown, but felt funky so left early by myself.

Walked along a boardwalk by the sea. Was beautiful late night.

Then out of nowhere I got this weird feeling, seriously like dread. Looked out and this “cloud” that couldn’t have been that big was hanging over the water and I swear it was looking at me and wanted to hurt me.

As I stopped and looked it seemed to actually be coming toward me.

I started walking away and it seemed to be following me, and moving faster.

Eventually I broke into a sprint I was so scared.

Still have no idea what it was but it was terrifying."

When i was like 6 i was playing outside in the snow in my front yard by the curb with my cousin when someone with their face painted white and wearing a black hoodie pulled up in front of me. Not too long after he did this my mom the the screen on my storm door down and started saying something to me. when she did this he immidietly drove off.
"This isn't crazy like the rest of the stories I'm reading, but when I was younger my parents would sometimes go to the late night track games my brothers raced in when they were in high school. Sometimes only my mom would go or vice versa so on occasion I would think I'm home alone just to head downstairs to see my dad at his laptop. The laptop my dad has, has this really loud key board that clacks when you type on it so you can hear it from a distance. Well, once there was a track meet that my mom left for at around 8 at night, and I was sitting on the couch in the living room watching YouTube on my phone. Once she left I figured my dad stayed because I could hear him typing on his laptop and clicking the mouse right behind me (his laptop was in the room behind the couch I was sitting on). I started talking to him about something (don't remember what lol probably something on the news) but I talked for at least five minutes before I realized he wasn't replying or making any sounds other than the typing so I said, ""Are you even listening?"" And turned around. There was no one there, the laptop was turned off and the chair was still pushed in under the desk. I remember getting really freaked and jumping off the couch.  I was literally talking to myself the whole time but I swear I could hear the keyboard, clear as day. I looked around the room really quickly and he wasn't in there, so I said ""fuck this, I'm going upstairs, bye"" and sprinted to my room, turning all the lights on along the way. This isn't a super creepy story or anything, but to believe with complete certainty that there is someone behind you, and hear them as if they were there just to realize you've been talking to yourself and hearing nothing really freaked out 13 y/o me."
"I was walking my dog at night, I noticed someone was following me so I turned around, we talked for a little and all of a sudden he said he wanted to kill me and grabbed my hand and wouldn’t let go. I ran home immediately after."
"My friend and I slowly drove by a car that was stopped at a stop sign one night, the dome light was on and all four passengers were sitting perfectly upright and staring straight forward, completely motionless with their eyes WIDE open. As we passed the car, nobody moved or acknowledged that we were staring at them, and as we continued down the road, the car remained in that exact spot until we lost visual of them. When I was leaving my friends house about 5 or 6 hours later, I was continuing down a different road roughly about a half mile from where this strange occurrence happened, when I approached a car that was pulled over on the side of the road, headlights facing toward me. I slowed down and was going to see if they needed any help until I realized that it was the SAME car from earlier in the evening. All four passengers, like before, were sitting perfectly upright in their seats, staring straight forward with the dome light on, not acknowledging the fact that I was staring at them. I nearly came to a full stop as I was passing them until they all abruptly and in perfect unison all turned their heads and looked directly at me. It was at that moment that I got this rush of fear deep down in my bones, and I slammed on the gas and took off down the road. But... their car once again didn't move an inch whatsoever. They never pursued me or anything. One of the most bizarre moments that I can recall."
"I was home alone, maybe around noon. I was sitting on the couch with my 2 dogs and I heard a creek from the kitchen. At first I think it’s just house noises because it’s almost 100 years old. But I decided to look anyway, when I get to the kitchen the basement door is wide open. I remembered it being closed when I got food because, you can open the pantry if the basement door is open. I look from the top of the stairs and don’t see anything so I close the door and go back to what I was doing. About an hour later I hear the creek again, go and look basement door wide open. I close it and put a chair in front of it to keep it from opening. Still have no clue how or why it opened on its own."
"Growing up my group of friends all lived in the same neighborhood. One time during college we were all back home and went out for a beer. This question was brought up and one of my friends got really serious and told us that while growing up sometimes as he was laying in bed two glowing faces would stare at him from his window. When he would scream or run away to get his parents they would disappear.

His little brother and my other friend started cracking up, and he replied that he wasn't lying he was serious!

His little brother and my other friend (who lived a couple doors down from him) said that sometimes they used to sneak out, crack open glow sticks and rub it on their faces, and make faces at his window. He was really dramatic and had a high pitch scream so it was hilarious to spook him. They never told him until then! Lol"
"So im a nocturnal one you see so im up real late but this takes place a couple years back when i was 14-15 years old.

I was up one night grinding out some CoD with they boys and i heard little taps from the window. Mind you this was school break so i thought it was some kids throwing pebbles at my window.

I played it off and continued to play then a couple hours later me and my friend josh were the only ones left on line grinding zombies. And the tapping returns again i decide to shake it off but it was strange how kids stayed up till 11pm to throw pebbles.

Anyway about an hour later josh signed off and i continued playing when i heard a crashing sound from below me. You see my rooms above the kitchen and i just stiffen and try text my friend and then some cliché horror film thing happens ... the fuckin power cuts and now im terrified as i heard hard boots hit the floor below.

I carefully open my door and see two dark tall figures waving around flashlights i nearly slammed my door but hid in a corner in my room and hid under clothes as i dialed 911.

After 2 minutes of excruciating waiting i get a hold of an operator as i quietly explain the situation he says he will dispatch 2 cars to my location and as he says that i hear another bang but farther away glass but i stay silent and wait for what felt like hours when i hear 2 sirens blair the footsteps grew quicker as the cop cars pull up i hear shouting ....
Then a gunshot .

So here i am home alone and a shoot outs about to break out when i hear alright on the floor as two metal thing clank on the floor i get out of the corner and tip toe down to find two grown men with handguns and crowbars on the floor cuffed.

Turns out the pebbles where to test if anyonr was home and when i didnt look they waited and then broke in.


TL;DR

I think im gonna get mugged when cops show up get into a gun fight and win."
"As a guy, just about getting raped by a girl was probably the weirdest thing possible.  Like i get the whole ""men can be sexually assaulted too"", but to actually be in that situation...  It's extremely weird.  I managed to throw her off and she gave up on it, it was a small school and even blackout I could see it running through her mind that she should give up and people would find out if she really did try to go through with it.  It took a while after that, and wasn't me trying to report her, but pretty much every knew by the end just how batshit crazy this girl was.  And it's not like I'm a super studly guy, I guess I'm just good enough looking but meek enough looking she thought I was a good target."
"Haven't been through a lot, but one thing I remember clearly is the long-seated fear that my brother would rape me. When I was younger, he would just... Pull out his penis. Any time our mom wasn't home and both of us were. I've got some serious anxiety and a vivid imagination, so that really freaked me out."
"My husband and I went up to a lookout in our town back when we were dating. Drove up the hill to go park and check out the city lights, but we get up there and there’s this car parked up there already. 

For some reason, the minute I see the car, I get this horrible feeling in my gut. I try to brush it off, I’m kind of a paranoid person, but the feeling won’t go away. I turn and look at my SO and say, “I have a really bad feeling about that car”, and he replies “Me, too.” 

From there, we whipped the car around and got the hell out of there. I’m still not sure to this day if we would have been in danger or if we would have come across something, but if both of us had a bad feeling, it seemed like it was a good thing we left when we did."
"Non paranormal I have to say when I was in high school when a big fat weirdo pedo looking janitor got super close behind me, I mean like less than an inch and almost touching, when I was alone trying to figure out what to select in a vending machine and just stood there looking down at me breathing heavily and I literally said outloud ""uhhhh what the fuck"" and after a minute or so of me trying to process what the fuck was happening and half expecting to get molested someone turned the corner and he instantly looked at them, stepped back in an almost robotic fashion, and literally MARCHED away from me... the guy who turned the corner even said ""what the fuck"""
"A couple times, I've been home alone and seen a woman walk into my brothers bedroom. (it's a kind of ongoing thing). She seems to be of a rich background, she wears a sort of nightgown with puffed sleeves that come back in at the wrist. Her hair is always very neat.

But I've only ever just caught her going in to my brothers room. A couple months back, I saw her as I was coming out my bedroom, leave my parents bedroom and walk into my brothers bedroom. She has never noticed me, nor does her precense make me feel unsafe. Its just confusing as to why she never comes to my room."
"Came home from a night out. Not completely wasted but a bit dizzy from drinks. It was in the suburbs of a small town, in the dead of night, so for entire 20 minutes walk i wouldn't encounter any human. Was pretty used to it since i took same road for years.

But anyway, was returning home in this particular night and i hear chain sounds. YES, f\*cking chain sounds, like in horror movies, in the dead of night, all alone. So i start walking faster, and i see where the sounds are coming. On the same side way as me it was a dog coming from the oposite direction. Like a MASSIVE black dog with a 2 meters chain tied to his neck. I instantly went to the other side of the road, (wasn't a large road), and when we passed near each other i was shaking to the point i could have a heart attack.

I was like 16 and not a too fit guy, so that could could have literally tore me apart before anyone could come and help me."
"ITT: 

Men: I saw something supernatural!

Women: Yeah, ghosts can’t compare to the creepy things men do to us."
"Was trying to pull the curtains down, and wondering why it wouldn't work. Was trying to fix it, then, all of a sudden, a bat felt out of it.

I was just saying ""oh why  isn't it going, what'S wrong"" - then a bat felt down on the floor, and I just calmly said ""aah, because of a bat"", as if a bat was a very common reason for non-working curtains. My sister would say ""what are you talking about, what bat"" - and then saw that bat on the floor. It was alive, but sick or something."
"When I was younger, I played with my cousin near the pond near his house and accidently dropped into it(for that moment I can't swim) and I started to sink my cousin started to scream and my grandma run from house to us. I have already gone under water and passed out , but my grandma saved my life.

Also I have a scar on my face (it looks like cross) because of I felt on the hit heater and my cheek was cultured.

(Sorry for mistakes, I come from Russia and learn language)"
"I woke up in the middle of the night. I guess I was sort of awake but I was still dreaming, however. So I look around my room, and at the end of my bed I saw a little pale boy with blonde hair and blue eyes, just sitting on the floor, resting his head on the bed next to my feet. I immediately started panicking, going into shock, screaming. I started kicking and punching the kid, without hitting him (cause he wasn't there, obviously). Then I turned on the lights and he was gone. Even though it wasn't real, I was scares out of my mind."

"One day I woke up, paralyzed, somehow magnetic drawn to something.  
After a few seconds my eyesight was getting darker very quickly as if there was a shadow all over the room. I felt a cold breeze like this ''something'' was slowly moving towards me. As soon as I managed to move my little finger just a tiny bit it was over. I'm pretty sure I was awake, but maybe I really didn't. It felt so real."
"About 8 years ago I was staying with my wife (girlfriend at the time) and her 2 year old daughter. I was having one of the most realistic dreams ever. Usually something is off and I'm a lucid dreamer but this dream was real. I walked into daughters room and right before I walk in I see a pair of adult legs sticking off the end of her bed. When I walked in they were gone and daughter was in the opposite corner hiding. I asked her what was wrong but she wouldn't answer. I turned around and a man was standing in the doorway and I got this sudden feeling of dread. He opened his mouth and the most god awful sound came out. At this point I woke up but I couldn't move or speak (sleep paralysis?). The terrible feeling was still there and I was freaking out. Eventually I was able to move and I woke up my wife to tell her about it. When I started telling her about the man, she stopped me and asked if he looked a certain way. She described almost exactly what I saw. She had had a dream a couple weeks earlier about a man coming out of the crawl space in daughters closet. To make matters worse she told me about how after she had that dream, our daughter would stare up at the ceiling and talk about a man crawling across the ceiling in her room. I immediately got our daughter and put her in bed with us. Needless to say we stayed at my place a lot more after that."
"Two stories, both happened to my mother who is the least superstitious out of all of us.

The first one was when we lived in England.  The house we were staying at had a hall way with doors on either side; both of which were hard to open as they get stuck easily; and a stairway.  One night, my mom went downstairs.  Once she hit the bottom step, the lights turn off, one of the doors open and closes, she feels a wind, the other door opens and closes, and the lights turn back on.  Mind you these are heavy old Victorian doors that get stuck really easily.

The next one starts with my mom as a child.  She’s an only child growing up in North Dakota with helicopter parents.  So she creates an imaginary friend named Thomas who lives in her closet.  My grandparents don’t like that as it’s not “normal”, so they got her a cat named Thomas.  Many years later, and my parents are visiting my grandparents in the same house, my older-brother is in my moms old room.  A few days after arriving, my Brother is talking about is new friend Thomas, who lives in the closet."
"A bit of background information: 
I was 17 the summer before my senior year of high school. I had a summer job as a lifeguard at a water park by my house. We weren't typical lifeguards that are on tv or anything, sitting up in chairs. At this facility we had to have roving guards. Basically to watch your zone of water you paced back and forth along the edge. Our uniform was a one piece suit and a neon yellow long tank top over it. We didnt wear shorts because of chafing. After about a week of the place being open they stopped requiring the shorts because we were bleeding where the shorts rubbed. I lived close enough to the pool where I could ride my bike to work. 

One day after closing, I was leaving and went out front to get my bike and go home. A few days prior, our manager told everyone to be more friendly and to answer questions customers have if we aren't actively guarding. So as I go out to get my bike there was a car parked in the drop off lane. The driver was an old man and rolled down his window to ask me something. I thought he was just a confused old man and was asking for the hours so I approached the car to talk to him. 

The man did ask hours and standard questions about the pool but he also slipped in some personal questions like whats my name and do I go to the school thats near, and if I lived close. I thought he was just being an overly friendly old person. But as he kept asking more questions and talking to me I started getting warning bells in my head to not give out personal information. I answered more vaguely.

Then right as I was starting to get creeped out, my supervisor is leaving the building and locking up. He notices me alone, talking to an old man and comes over just to make sure everything is alright. As soon as he says a greeting and starts walking towards me, the old man quickly drove away. My supervisor and I both agreed that it was super weird. He offered to put my bike in the back of his truck and to drive me home. I declined and just took a non direct route and kept an eye out for the old mans car.  

Nothing really happened for the next couple of days but that weekend the old man comes to the pool when it was really busy. I was guarding a section of the lazy river where the walkway was narrower behind me, so I ended up guarding right on the edge of the pool with a lot of people close behind me. I am paying attention to the water, doing my job, when I hear someone talk to me in a voice that only I would be able to hear over the noise. It says ""Hey are you [my name]?"" I could have sworn I felt something brush against my ass, but I couldnt be sure it was inntentional because there were a lot of people that bumped into me. 

I didn't reply because I had gotten to the edge of my zone and turned to pace back the other way. I saw it was the man from the car. He walked away and sat near the next zone in my rotation. That zone was at an island in the middle of the river. The guards would take off their tank tops to try to keep them dry because having a wet shirt was awful. Your suit under would never get fully dry before you had to go to that zone again so you were just hot and sticky for the rest of the day. 

The man sat there and just stared at me waiting for me to go to that zone so he could watch me in my swim suit. I blew the whistle code for a supervisor and explained the situation to him. He called for the guard on his break to come take my place and took me out of rotation to go into the break room while we called the police. Before the police showed up though, the old man disappeared... 

It was honestly very creepy. I don't know what would have happened had I not acted. I have always guessed he would have tried to take me after work one day. 

The next year we had this man with white hair but the face of a 40 year old who frequented the park. One of the other frequent members said she had gone out with this man, but got a creepy vibe from him so she looked him up. Turns out he is a registered sex offender and cannot be within 2000ft of a public park. We tried calling the police several times after he showed up, but he never stayed long enough for them to catch him. One day after my shift was done, I was headed out to my bike and I saw him putting his bike into the back of someones truck. The driver of the truck was the creepy old man from the previous year.... Ugh apparently creepy old guys hang out together."
"I was in the Edinburgh catacombs on a ghost tour with my university, and they took us into a room that had a kind of stone loft taking over half the room with a blocked off doorway beneath it.

I'd been on a similar tour before, and I knew they'd turn the light off so when they did I tapped someone on the shoulder to spook them. The moment I did I felt such an angry feeling coming from the stone loft that I ended up pressing against the girl I'd tried to scare. My hair was on end. Somebody didn't want me stealing the scare!"
"When I was about 11 years old, I visited my classmate's house for the first time. We were playing games and having a good time, then my parents picked me up.  
A few months later, I learned that my classmate's father was sentenced to 11 years in prison for rape. He raped multiple women and girls - one of them was only 12 years old.  
It haunts me to this day because HE WAS HOME when I was there. I saw him and greeted him. He looked like a completely normal person to me. I keep thinking, what if my parents couldn't pick me up? What if he offered to ride me home? I would have said yes, I had no reason to suspect anything. So yeah, it wasn't a creepy/scary experience back then, but after I learned who he really was, the memory just terrifies me."
Sleep paralysis will fuck you up for life.
"Walking around ikea and baby was hungry. I was breastfeeding at the time but I decided to half cover... the store was empty but this one dude ran up to me from behind and tried to take a picture of my boob with the kid on it.

Jokes on him since the “good part” was covered. I wanted to punch him but could catch him. It’s difficult to run with a kid on your tit. Who knew? Lol"
"I inherited a plant from my aunt when she died. Several years later, I was hibernating on a hot weekend and binge-watching the first season of Stranger Things.  I happened to look over at this plant and it suddenly had a bloom of pink flowers on it. I'd had this plant for several years and it never had flowers before. It scared the shit out of me in a Poltergeist kind of way."
"me and a friend we went out and knocked on doors and then hid us. they were an old man who got really angry but he never found us so he stood and screamed. we were 10 years old during that time. we sat in a place behind a little timber and when he walked in we ran forward and knocked this we did 6 times. Once, he came out with a gun. he began to look for his plot. as he approached us we ran. he fired a warning shot. we were so scared that we brought a knife into the room that we could have in defense if he came.  
sorry for my english (google translate)"
"A girl I was talking to in freshman year of college (not flirting - literally just talking because we shared a class), went up to my best friend at the cafeteria having never met him, sat with him, and proceeded to talk to him about me for half an hour.

Now I had never told her that he and I were friends - so she had either gone through my Facebook friends or tagged pictures, found that we were both at the same university, and tracked him down to get information about me.

She got blocked shortly after."
"Visiting my boyfriend's family in farm land, upstate NY.   I hear cows.  Nothing unusual.  But I'm also hearing this weird metallic bang.  Not like a gunshot though, but the cows are also really loud.  I asked his mom what was up with the cows and she nonchalantly tells me they're being slaughtered.  So there I am trying to enjoy my tea with Mom, and the windows open in the quaint barn house (no air-conditioning in summer), with cows screaming in the distance.  Over the course of the day less and less cows are mooing, and I'm trying to enjoy my vacation."
"It was my first experience with sleep paralysis.

But I think it also might have been a dream at the same time.
It was confusing.

I woke up unable to move a muscle.

After a few seconds of panicking, I remembered some tricks to get myself out of sleep paralysis.

Willing own feelings come back into your body.

I typically think that is BS, but this time it worked.
I sat up and looked around my room.

It felt off.

Like the room was moving around me.

I reach for my phone to check the time, and see that it is 3:27 a.m.

Then I hear sound from across my room.

I get that feeling that I'm being watched.

The hair standing up on the back of my neck, the chill going down my spine, and that undeniable sense pure dread.

I hear the sound of heavy, raspy breathing.
Something was in my room, and I didn't know what it was, but I knew I wasn't safe.

I could hear the phlegm crackling its throat upon each and every breath it took.

A cold sweat quickly ran over my body.

The room felt cold.

No, not cold, it was absolutely freezing.

As much as I wanted to wrap myself in my blankets, and hide, just pray for that thing to go away, I knew I had to find out what was in my room.

I hesitantly turn on my phone's flashlight.

I slowly pan it across my floor, towards the other side of my room.

Then I stopped when I see pair of black loafers, partially covered by dark trench coat.

I felt like my surroundings restarting to warp even more, as I slowly drug my flashlight over the creature's body.

It had the shape of a man, but I knew it wasn't human.

As the light revealed more and more of its features, I saw that in one clenched-fist it held something furry in its gloved hand, the other holding something silver and sharp, with the red stain on it.

I do not want to go any further, but I knew I had to.

When the light hit its face, I was overcome with pure terror.

A scream was frozen into my throat.


Its features look like an amateur sculpted them out of clay.
Everything was over exaggerated.

The toothless smile was spread from ear-to-ear like an endless cavern.

Its eyes were hollow and empty triangular sockets.

Its face was heavily textured, a dull, muted, pinkish beige.

I can see that some parts of its face was swollen with inflammation, black veins crawling under the skin like a virus is corrupting it.

Suddenly the whole image became clear as my surroundings are warped and distorted beyondy comprehension.

I saw that in one hand he held my sweet, sassy, white rabbit, her throat was slit, her head almost severed.

All sound stopped, other than a ringing in my ears, and dull thuds of my heart.

When I finally woke that none of it had happened.


Ever since that night, that monster has been a reoccurring entity in all of my nightmares...

He's always there,

I feel like he's always been there.
That maybe I'm just noticing him for the first time.

I'm going to post a picture this on r/sleepparalysis when I draw him, along with this story."
"I was like 8-9 years old.i woke up in the middle of the night and standing next to my bed, staring at the was a clown. It kinda had the body of those sack baby dolls and it had blonde curly hair, black diamond shapes around the eyes and red lipstick.

I was probably just seeing things as I only saw it for a split second and it was dark. But I was terrifying"
"Me and my friends were exploring a abandoned house in the middle of the woods. It’s was 10:00 o’clock at night we heard a scream from the bedroom of the house we all had flashlights and it was 4 of us, we went into the room and we saw naked old man scratching a wall while screaming we ran out terrified and we called the police they searched the house and found the man who had escaped a nearby mental asylum. He had mental issues and now is getting the help he needs."
"I was home with my ex and our dog. I just got out of the shower and hung up my robe on the door that goes to the closet. My closet is attached to the bathroom, and there’s a door to separate the two, but I always keep it open and just hang my robe on a hook. I was looking for something in one of the bathroom drawers, and from my peripheral, saw something go in my closet. I could tell it was really dark, and moved without any rhythm, like someone on a moving sidewalk. I immediately knew it wasn’t my dog. This feeling of ‘release the shit so you can faster’ came over me. My robe was swinging, from whatever had brushed next to it. I called for my dog, very timidly, hoping he would come out of the closet, no pun intended. He didn’t. I poked my head out of the bedroom and asked my ex where our dog was, he replied “next to me, why?” I hauled ass out of that room, naked and shaking. He thought I was crazy until something happened to him a few weeks later."

"It was an episode of my sleep paralysis, I'm an introvert so I dont talk to many people but I had one friend at the time. She was the closest person to me, but once I fell asleep. I saw the worst things imaginable. I saw my only friend crying on her knees before my bed. While a dark figure was standing behind her, but I just had to sit there and watch as the figure slowly dragged her away from me. All these words everyone says about are just screaming inside my head. Next thing I know I wake up crying on the floor of my closet."
Definitely finding my mom's nude corpse stiff from rigor mortis with a bag over her head with a belt tied around it. Was sitting at her desk and when she fell back she looked like a bug. Remember how cold she was.. Either that or the blood vats at my old job.
"Pretty sure my friend and I saw a hell hound about 15 years ago. We were driving around close to midnight and saw what looked like a huge dog, but its eyes were looked like they were reflecting light when there was no light shining on them, and its shoulders seemed to be more like a humans rather than a dog."
I was sleeping over at my friends house (she lives in one of those older houses) this was back in grade eight. My friend and I heard baby cries coming from the spare bedroom which no one goes into...we were both freaked the fucked out because 1st off she’s the only child and why would there be a baby crying in the home??? Both of us were too scared to check but I opened the door to her bedroom to peep in the hallway to see if I could hear a noise and it was gone. We still don’t know what it was to this day and that’s probably best left unknown...
"I went over to my grandpas house and my little cousin was there, he was staring at my grandpas room down the hallway and started to cry, I asked him what was wrong he said “they want me to come play with them but there eyes look scary and they look evil.”"
"Late to the show...

One of my childhood fears was that I’d look out of my bedroom window at night and see a face looking back at me.

So a few years ago I was working on a secure psychiatric ward on a night shift. We had to account for all the patients being present and breathing once every hour (unless they were on 4x hourly or constant observations). 

I was wandering down the corridor around 3am doing my checks. The bedroom doors have privacy windows which we have keys for so we can silently make the privacy windows transparent to look into the patients’ rooms. Got to the end of the corridor to check on a notoriously dangerous and deranged patient (paranoid psychotic, homicidal stalker type).

I went up to his door and turned the privacy window key and saw his face inches from mine staring straight at me with a horrible malevolent grin on his face. Made me jump back and let out a loud “fuck” to which he responded with a demonic laugh.

I got my other staff member to do the checks for the rest of the night...

Still gives me the shivers..."
"I am half Eastern European and lived for a while in said country and when I was 16 my family where broke and it was only me, my twin sister my lil sisters and my uncle and aunt and one baby boy cousin. I worked at a restaurant with my twin and one day we are going back to our apartment at like 11 pm I notice a guy walking behind us. (We are from a minority of this country and always get problems cause it’s clear we are a minority) so I always have a gun I know it’s dumb but this was Eastern Europe in 2017. So then we keep walking and I tell my twin not to look back t their might be a guy following us. 5 mins l8r he’s still behind us. Then suddenly my twin turns and he fully runs at us I had actually got the gun ready from a time so I turn and shoot right on the leg (I go to shooting ranges) the guy then starts bursting out laughing and we run off and he starts to crawl. We didn’t have credit in our phones so we found a security guard for a park & tell him police found blood but no body I got charged for having an illegal weapon and went to juve for 3 months"
"I was at home, alone. I was pretty young, probably around 14...

You know that old video, theo ne of the creepy manequin girl who sings ""I feel fantastic""?

Yeah well my phone started playing it. I wasnt watching it, I didnt even have youtube open. I was like uhhhhhh what and then opened youtube and closed it. It kept on playing. I locked my phone, it kept playing. I tried to restart my phone, but it didnt work. No matter what I tried the song kept playing on and on, and wouldnt stop. 

I started getting teary eyed because I was honestly just scared, its a creepy ass song andI thought my phone was haunted. I ended up taking the battery out and guess what 

It still played. 

Dont ask me how BECAUSE I DONT KNOW HOW but I did throw it across the room. Called up my mum when it stopped in full on tears"
"I was at my friends house for a sleepover and I guess his parents had been really wanting and planned their sex night  because they did not stop for anything that night knowing I was over. Now my friend has asthma and he can get really stressed out. Were sitting downstairs playing Fortnite and he gets killed by soccer skins 4 matches in a row, and he just flipped out and started having an asthma attack so as stupid as I am I didn't know he had an inhaler so I go out of the room with him on my shoulder and his hand at the worst possible moment his hand slipped you know the super stupid moment that happens in movies. This triggered the worst possible event that probably could've happened and his parents room door opens and I see his his dad pulling huge marbles out of her ass on a string. From that moment on I have never gone back there."
"Not the CREEPIEST per say but it's still something. This guy would come into the coffee shop almost every day of the week with his laptop. I didn't think much of it, just another person using the wifi. Until he actually began talking to my co workers and sometimes me. I noticed how grimey he looked, and how much older he was up close. He would stare at me, my chest, and I could feel his gaze when I turned my back if you know what I mean. I never talked to him unless he was ordering something. One time I came out from the back to see if my co worker needed help, and then that guy suddenly ran up to the counter, and leaned over it to get closer to us. I backed up and walked away and I heard him comment ""she must be scared of me! Heheheheeh!"" Yes, fucking indeed I was, you weirdo. Later in the day he was still there, and I just avoided him and hoped he would eventually leave. He didn't. My co worker was talking to him alot, and they seemed to be getting along. Closing time came around, so I turned off a couple lights to signal the customers out. He didn't leave. He stayed at the table with his laptop, not moving. I hinted again and locked the doors (you can open them from the inside, but not the outside). Still stayed in his spot. I brought my co worker into the back and told her to tell him to leave, since he creeped me out too much. She went pale and said she was also scared of this man, as he was hitting on her pretty innapropiately all day. I decided 'fuck it' and went back out to count the till. Grimey man approached me and asked ""so what highschool do you go to?"" I didn't answer. I took my share of the tips and left my co-worker to count the rest of the till. She is in her twenties, and I am still a minor. I figured she could handle him a lot better than I could. I told her to text me if something happens and left. When I got in the car, I told my mom about the man, and she said to pull back around. She went sheet pale and said she knows this man, and that he is an actual pedophile. I'm panicking and I was about to go back inside to threaten him when he came out, looked at me, and smiled. I whipped out of there, and my mom said that this man has been harassing her at her workplace for SIX YEARS. Enough is enough and I call the police. He was found eventually and removed from the property. I called my co-worker, and made sure she was okay. She said nothing bad happened, but he asked her out thinking she was a fifteen year old. She said he kept trying to ask about me, my name, my school, and my age. She told him to fuck off, and he left the coffee shop. The worst part is that he has been banned from the area for a year. Which in my mind, means that he was not in the cafe by coincidence. I still feel really bad for leaving my co worker with him, but I knew I would be close by for at least a little bit, and I could even see inside the windows. All I know is, if I see this kid loving fuckhead again, he will never harass me or my mother again."
"I was never one to believe in demons, and when I heard people talk about nightmares or dreams, I'd often think ""yeah, yeah bullshit"". That is until recently, I had an extremely vivid and horrifying dream of being at the ""last stop"". I suffer crippling addiction and mental health problems, and I'm often scraping by with near-death experiences, poor health and suicidal thoughts. Here, at the last stop, I was feeling what it was like at the end of my life, digesting all the grief, regret and sadness and while doing so there was someone that I had thought I recognized, and later speaking with him I noticed his face was twisted in this horrific demonic grin and enjoying himself, enjoying my suffering. 

It's horrifying to be in such emotional turmoil, pain and suffering and to see something revel in it.. The way I interpret it, this was a manifestation of my addiction. I've often felt like there's something taking control, that I'm in the backseat watching helplessly as my life is destroyed. 

The grin, the eyes, the greedy hunger was so malicious and evil. That face haunts me."
like 10 years ago I was walking down the street and this old lady (like imagine anyone who ever put a curse on someone in a fairy tale) said hello to me by name.  no clue who she was.
"I was out with a couple of friends at a club and we decided to go walk up to a fast food place, on the way there was this homeless guy who started to chat with one of my friends the whole walk.

He eventually left and I didnt think much of him since it is not uncommon to have a homeless person come and beg for a while until they get some cash from us. (None of us had cash on us, only enough for the club entry, and our cards for drinks)

When we headed back to the club the guy started following us for a while until my one buddy told him to go away.

Before the guy left he said he would see us later.

Still creeps me out thinking back on it."
"When I was coming home late from school, I got on the bus only to see this creepy old man staring at a girl around my age. She caught his gaze, and would have disregarded it if he wouldn't have licked his lips everytime she moved. Normally, she got off the bus and waited for a different bus. He then turned around and started looking at me. Mind you, I was 14 at the time, and sexual consent is 16 in my country. I gave him the finger, but he started *rubbing himself*. Nevermind licking his lips, the dumbass actually started to rub the bulge in his pants! There was a camera on the bus too, so the driver was observing this shit on his mirror and started texting on his phone whenever he got the chance. This went on for about 20 minutes until I got home.

The next day, an officer asked for me at school, and I told him about what happened. I saw on the news later that day that he was arrested for child abuse and CP possession.

Thinking about still gives me chills, but at least a PP has been served justice."
a spider on my morning wood
The time I woke up and Trump was president.
"Saw a demon. Scared the shit out of me. Wasn't even big. Size of a cat.

Hollywood couldn't create a creepier looking creature though."
"This happened a few years ago, It was 5:55 pm and I wasn't home alone. Was sitting on bed trying to rest a bit meant to get up at 6:00, closed my eyes a bit then opened them to look at the time again and saw someone standing there thought it could be a relative but it wasn't. A human looking thing with long blonde hair, dark face, angry looking and maybe a beard. (pretty much looked like a super saiyan 3 lol) Anyways I get up on my elbows to get a better look at this thing and  was immediately drenched in a cold sweat, the thing was staring down at me with eyes darker than the night and a crazy angry looking face. I kept my eyes locked on this person  thing for what felt like forever and it slowly faded into the wall. After it was gone I kept looking at the wall and there was a plastic bag on the wall that was shaped the exact same as this things hair and facial features but it wasn't nearly as realistic looking as before. Then I look at the time and it was 5:58 pm. I still don't know what it was but It could have been a ghost or something or maybe imagination/hallucination. Either way you don't want an angry super sayian 3 looking down at you when you wake up."
"Almost dying. Multiple times. 1: Almost toppling off a mountain (I was 6-8, I don't remember), 2: Running out into traffic for a cup (I was 9), 3: nearly falling over gaurd rails high enough for it to kill me (I don't remember what age)."
When I was 17 I travelled to London with my sister (19 at the time) to have an interview at a college there. We stayed over night at a cute little hotel. In the middle of the night we wake up because we hear noise coming from our door and the sound of keys. I was still half asleep as I see my sister shoot out of bed running screaming towards the door. The fucking guy who gave us the keys was standing in our room. He looked surprised and just turned around and shouted 'sorry'. We locked the door and left the keys in. My sister didn't sleep at all after that and I don't even want to image what would have happened if only one of us had been there.
I kept having reoccurring dreams about a little girl who would stand in the corner of my room.  I never told anyone and one night I had a friend sleep over and she asked me the next day why I never told her about my little sister and why she was watching us.
"When we were young my friend, her little brother and i used to play this game called spirits. Basically you get a deck of cards find the four aces and you shuffle the deck.  Everyone sits in dark room in a circle with a flashlight turned on. One person sets down 3 aces face up asks if eveeyone is comfortable if they are the person sets the last one face down and you don't move from your position until the game is over.  You go around and ask yes or no questions and flip a card. If the card is red that means no, if it's black that means yes.  Basically your supposed to be talking to ghosts. 
Now her house is haunted, not too badly but weird stuff happens. So we were playing in her room near her doorway. In the corner across from her door her sister had a mini guitar set against the wall.  We asked questions and one was ""do you play guitar the card was black and we continued our game. No shit five minutes later we heard what sounded like someone running their fingers across the guitar strings.  I lost my shoe and ran outta the room Fuck the four aces rule."
"I was around 13 when this happened, my mom and I were living with my grandma, I have paranoia and I have trouble deciding if this is real or not but it felt real.  I was upstairs laying down while my mother slept downstairs on the couch, (she wanted to wake up early so she said), I was just about to go to sleep when I heard my panda bear plushie fall on some bags  underneath it, it was sitting on the chair by the window in my bed. I thought I was just the wind but outside was completely still. That's when I heard something crawl under my bed, it sounded like it crawling fast. My body went cold instantly. This is a true story."
"In My house there are lights that turn pink when the garage door opens. One night when i was home alone upstairs, I go downstairs because I feel hungry and when i open the door, The lights. Were. Pink. At first i didn’t think much if it because maybe they were on when someone left, But then i hear something fall. I searched the house cautiously, But luckily no one was there. The thing that fell was just in a bad spot.

Tldr - I Thought there was an intruder but it was nothing."
"I experience  very brief sleep paralysis on a semi- regular basis. I have never not been able to break out of it and move,  but the hallucinations get me. Its almost always a very large man-shaped figure in my doorway or standing over me in bed. 

The one that still freaks me out is when i wole up to a dark man-shape in my bed crawling forward to put his hand over my mouth.

Im not sure how much of what i do in response is dream or not,  but i can generally scream very effectively but not talk.

When i lived with my parents for a while it was embarrassing and i had to finally tell them to please open the door and turn on the light when this stuff happens dramatically enough to wake them up, because i can't talk well during the episode so i can't tell them what's going on until i am all the way awake. 

I felt awful about it and honestly those dreams bother me more than the time my house was actually broken into while i was there. 

When there was real danger present i acted perfectly,  when its in my head i feel completely powerless."
"The time I was almost kidnapped, i was ten years old and it was eleven at night, this strange dude just appears out of nowhere with a white van, he asked me if he could show me something and that i had to enter his car, he opened the back and tried to push me in, but I had been on karate for three years back then and I knew something wasn't right because I was always taught stranger danger, so I punched him in the stomach, then he got back in his van and sped off..
That is my story"

"About a half of a mile behind my parent's house, we have an old abandoned farm property. It's complete with two farm houses and 3 barns, and stood empty for years and still does. We used to call it, ""The Old Barn,"" for some reason and would go back and explore as a family, and when my friends would come over we would do the same. We used to throw big Halloween parties, and my dad would set up a haunted trail and hay ride back there, it was awesome. 

One day my best friend and I went back there, we were probably in about 4th grade if I remember correctly. One of the houses had two stories, and some of the windows were busted out. We decided to screw around and throw rocks at the windows that had some glass left. After a few minutes of doing this, we surveyed our work, and suddenly a rock came flying right back at us. It missed, but we were freaked out. There was no way anyone could have entered the house, or whole property for that matter, without us seeing. We paused, looked at each other, and ran all the way back to my house. 

The whole property is still there, just falling to ruin. Many of us in my family and many of my friends have always said they've had weird stuff happen to them back there, and that they've seen stuff they can't explain. Regardless, it's still an interesting place to explore and show to people when they visit."
"I live pretty near the east coast and would go (and still do) to the beach often. I was around 12 years old and decided to leave our condo one night to see the beach at night, as I thought it looked pretty cool.

 I was chilling out there for a couple of minutes when one of the beach garbage trucks started rolling by, as they very often did at this time of night. However, this one had stopped at the garbage can in front of me for what felt like minutes. I was confused but just stared at it. 

The truck was holding a can, but then let it down and started to slowly drive toward me. I decided I was a bit creeped out and walked toward the exit path. The garbage truck started to gain steam, so I decided to run. I had no idea what was going on but decided not to risk anything

Im almost to the sidewalk and turn around, expecting to see my paranoid ass running from nothing, but the truck is barreling down the exit path, so I decide to dive onto the sidewalk. The truck scrapes into the curve behind me, and then drives away as if nothing happened. My grandad was on the deck and happened to see the whole thing, and immediately rushed down to help me.

They dont use those trucks anymore, but I dont go on the beach at night."
"Story time-
I was about 15 at the time smoking a shit ton of weed with a group a friends (Maybe 8 of us) at a pitch black park when someone calls the cops. This was a small town outside of Scranton, Pa where the cops loveee to put kids in juvy for weed. When we see a police car we all book it- after a while of back and forth (we would run down the field, they would get in the car and drive down the road the field was against, we would run back, they would drive back up and try to get out, repeated) me and 2 others who were in front got the chance to sprint into a wooded path while the cops were about 15 feet away also sprinting at us towards the path to the side. I don’t know if I’ve ever had so much adrenaline; anyways after blindly throwing our bodies through the woods falling over and gashing ourselves on fallen trees and whatnot we settle behind bushes all laying face down. We hear the police in the woods and see there flashlights on going over our heads - but we’re so scared to move because it was Autumn, the leaves were so obnoxiously loud. After about an hour of facedown nature loving we make the move to run as fast as we could away from the lights and towards the exit. 

THATS NOT EVEN THE CREEPY PART

to this day I don’t understand what this was or why. We got out of the woods into a large backyard, there was a great big bush the size of a tree just 10 feet out of the forest but making coverage from the top to the ground so it was impossible to see behind it. We all know there is someone behind it some how, maybe they were making a small amount of noise i can’t remember-  so we rotate around and they do as well. So we’re still at contrasting ends of this circle unable to see each other. After a full rotation I give out  a” hello?” and a very sweaty shook black guy (youngish, mid-late 20’s) in a flannel and pants stops rotating so we can see him. This was at 3 am in a town of 5,000 people. maybe 15 black people at most. this man was in someone’s backyard running in the opposite direction that we were running towards. It was literally a scene from Get Out. He greets us super shookly and takes a look back at us for security while bordering the woods now. Just runs right in. Never laughed so hard when I got to a safe place the mind fuck will live on forever"
"i was like maybe 9 or 10 and me and my dad were on the MTR (the hong kong subway) back home from a check up at the doctors after school. 

(important information: the seats were up against the opposite walls of the train and there was a railing on the ceiling for standing passengers to hold onto, which was placed along the seating.)

i was sitting there on one of the seats and there was this old guy with graying hair maybe around 60 years old staring at me. i was kinda uncomf but i didnt really think about it, but then he came to stand in front of where i was sitting and put both his arms up on the railing and just looked down at me making eye contact for what mustve been like a few minutes, which seriously creeped me out. i remember feeling kind of like he was ""trapping"" me with both his arms up on the ceiling railing like a cage which just added to the discomfort that i felt, esp with me being a tiny little girl at the time. eventually, the person who was sitting to my right got off the train and that old guy moved to sit next to me, so i called out to my dad who was sitting to my left to switch seats with me, making sure the guy heard me do so in an effort to let him know that my dad (who was bigger than him) was around to protect me in case he tried anything. i dont remember whether it was him who got off first or us though."
"I recently dealt with a member of the public who was coming to singing groups I was running. His text messages to my work phone were increasingly sketchy until his final message asked me to 'teach him my body language so he could please me'

Probably doesn't seem like.much but it was an escalation too far and really gave me the creeps. 

He was politely asked to stop.. Which he didnt and the cops ended up being involved"
"Me and my family was on a holiday, out in the woods. My dad's boss had let us borrow his holiday home, because he and my dad were close. We arrived there, and a big Rottweiler barked at us, and ran around our car. Soon an old man came and took the dog away, he was the neighbor. We got out and did our thing. One evening we were watching a horror movie, because we thought it would be fun, since it was raining and thunders could be heard. I told the others that, I was going to get some milk in the kitchen. I got my milk, and slowly went back to the living room. As I walked in, I looked outside the big glass door. I spilled milk all over myself, because I got so scared. Outside stood the neighbor and his dog. I quickly called my parents, to get their attention. They calmed me down, and asked the neighbor what he was doing here, this late at night. He said he didn't mean to scare me, and that he only came to give some eggs. I couldn't sleep that night, because of what had happened. The neighbor was an old lonely man, that didn't take care of himself."
"My friend and I snuck out of his Dad's house at 3:00 AM to ding song ditch people (I know I was a douche bag), and we heard gunshots pretty close to us. And before that, we had to hide from the cops by lying down on the side of the street down a super tiny hill. Luckily the guy was probably tired as hell"
"I realized some guy at a resort tried to lure me somewhere when I was literally like 7. He worked there in animation. I was obsessed with the little dances and stuff, and he gave me a lotttt of attention, which I obviously thought was innocent/due to being a cute little dancer person. One day he told me to meet behind the stage at a certain time that night, because all the kids would be there for this activity. I got there and there was no one. Then he just kind of emerged from the side of the curtains, smiling. I know his intentions were fucked up, and I'm happy I ran back to my parents at dinner. The end."
Finding my 49 year old husband dead in the bedroom floor.
Thinking there was an intruder coming to my house because I did not recognize the car. It was my mom getting a ride home from a coworker.
"In 2012, we rented a top floor flat in one village in Sussex. My daughter was about 2 years old. She used to cry a lot out of no reason. One weekend when we all were home, she cried and I asked what happened? She pointed her finger to empty space saying “uncle, uncle”."
"when i was around 10, i walked home from school with two of my friends to one of the girl’s house, only about 10 minutes away. the other girl’s mom said she’d pick us up halfway cause she was on her way to work anyway, so we walked toward her car. JUST as we got to it, this man in a wife beater drove up in his white truck and asked us if we’d seen “a dog.” he asked if we could show him. we said no, and he drove off, looking kind of upset. we were all shook up from it, got in the mom’z car, and went home. i felt super uneasy because logically when asking for a lost dog, you don’t just say “a dog,” you describe the color, breed, etc. but they didn’t. the next day, my friends mom told the school, and they found the men’s records. they were both multiple time offenders for sexual assault and pedophelia. apparently they both escaped jail, and the first place they decided to stop by was a school. still terrifies me to this day that all three of us 10 year old girls very well could’ve been kidnapped, or worse, had the mom not been there."
"Stayed at my best friends grandmas house with him when we were kids. He was really misbehaving and his gran went into a fit of rage, had a panic attack and then collapsed on the floor. We both went into a wild panic, and tried to wake her. We feared the worst. Then all of a sudden, her eyes just opened really wide and she stared at him with the most devious, evil look on her face and didn't move for 5 minutes. Scared the fucking shit out of me. My hairs are still stood on end."
"I'm female. Living in a small town.
This was years ago and I was in my late 20's. I had just purchased my house the year before and lived alone. I wasn't seriously dating anyone but did have the occasional visitor. A small appartment building is across the street from my house and a friend knew one of the guys who lived there...she wasn't friends with him but knew of him and told me his name. He fancied himself a ladies man. IRL he was average at best. 
One day he flagged me down as I was driving by...he was friendly, we talked a bit and I took his number when he offered. I really was just being polite and didn't lead him on at all. He just wasn't my type.
A day or so later I am home, alone. The french doors on the BACK of my house are opened to my screened porch. I'm cleaning and suddenly there he is....came through the back porch door, French doors and was in the middle of my house! Started  saying how he saw me over here mowing the yard and working alone...he could help me. Told me how he never saw guys over here I must be lonely. Tried to stroke my arm and kiss me! 
Creepy! Creepy! Like a bad porno.

I sent him away...unfulfilled. 
It's been around 16 years now and I still get pissed that I still think about him when I have the French doors open. I had to put a lock on the screen door.
(He never bothered me again. I found out he was in a local band and slept around constantly. He was killed in a bad accident a couple years after this.)"
"I have two. Worst to less worse. 

1. I almost witnessed a (I believe a) 7 year old boy get run over by a truck. It was during a small get together. Neighbors were on the front yard of my parents house, grill out and games. There was a ball pit which I remember seeing him in. I remember this vividly. 

I was playing that game where you would throw a bean bag into a wooden slab that had holes in it. After throwing in the second bean bag I turn my head after seeing something in my peripheral vision, so I turn my head to look over at it since it caught my attention. Before I could shout out. The boy ran forward. Chasing a ball from the inflated ball pit and into the road. The truck basically scraped the child. Barely missing him and speeding off. The noise of the car speeding by caught the attention of grown-ups and they all realized that a child could've gotten hit. We didn't know the mother or the kid but we felt horribly bad for her because that truck was definitely trying to hit him. It made me feel sick to my stomach because I truly believed that I was about to see a 7 year old get hit by a truck.

2. This one isn't that creepy like the first one but here ya go. This was a some time ago. 

My family and I were going camping but ended getting stranded because our truck needed to get fixed and the mechanic wasn't fixing it because of his workers calling it sick or whatever. So we decided to make the best of it. My dad, to sisters and I went out for a walk in the woods in the middle of the night. Brought a flashlight with us of course. Deep into the woods my dad had to stop and take a piss. Of course my sister's and I were pretty terrified so we shined the flashlight into the woods. Stopping when we got the reflection of two eyes. Definitely a best. The eyes were really close to us. And not even a second later another set of eyes shows up and we book it. It wasn't that creepy but definitely shocking at the time."
"I was an extremely paranoid person when I was 12, so paranoid I had a karambit knife

I heard a loud bang in my room late at 3 am and since at night is when my fears start to get amplified, what made it worse was it kept coming up until I took my knife and waited at the door, ""Go for the eyes"" was my plan but I didn't think I have the balls to kill a guy until I realized it's him or me. I stood there holding my knife raised up for 20 minutes, 2 months later I realize it was a cat in the attic."
"I have a creepy story, and some weird stories.

Starting with the weird ones: 
1 or 2 years ago, i was sleeping and having a dream about bugs, when suddenly, i woke up. And i looked a the pitch black corner on the roof, and saw shadowy bugs and other slimy, creepy crawlies like slugs and centipedes, crawling all over. I then checked under my pillow and they where also there! I dont remeber how scared i was, but i do recall slaping and smacking the matress thinking i was killing the bugs.

And once, i was in a similar situation, where i woke up, and was thirsty. I checked on the side of the bed to see if there where any water bottles (because in my house we keep water bottles everywhere), and, there was one shadowy water bottle, close enough for me to grab. I tried to do so, but i couldnt. My hand passed right through it. After a couple of swipes, it was gone.

Ok, now the REALLY juicy story. (Compared to the other two, at least)

Recently, i was trying to sleep, and i was closing my eyes, just about to get some rest, when i suddenly heard knocks on the bedroom window. I thought someone was trying to break in, so, even if my body was pumped with adrenaline, making me ready to run for my life, i just stayed under the covers, motionless, thinking that the supposed intruder wouldnt notice me. I didnt hear anymore knocks after that, but even so, i was terrified, (and still am scared) about it."
"Every couple of months I have this very vivid dream, to the point I can basically remember all the details now.

Basically it always starts with me waking up that day, it fast forwards through school to about 4-5pm where we're hanging out being the little shits that we were back in high school. It starts getting dark, but we don't go home, just wandering around. Anyway our school used to be out near the back of the city, going towards the countryside.

There was this pretty big gymnasium just down the road from our school, in my dream though it's always run-down and decrepit-looking (despite our school looking /exactly/ how I remember it). Naturally, we end up going to see what's inside it. That's when the generic horror-movie stuff kicks in, we end up trapped by a group of guys in there who start doing awful shit. Usually slightly different each time...

The end usually ends up with one of my friends being pushed to the middle of the room, the bad guy saying, ""Say goodbye."" followed by that friend getting shot, and me bolting awake in a cold sweat...

That was until a few nights ago. Where it would normally end, my friends are looking at me and I 'feel' a gun pushed to the back of my head and hearing, ""It's different this time."" before a click, and bolting awake, freezing cold, and with a massive headache.

Can't say I've had many 'creepy' experiences, but that felt genuinely terrifying."
"When I was about 9, it was 6 pm, I was sat in bed watching my ipad. (most likely minecraft lmao) I heard my mum's voice. and her handing me an empty green bowl, odd thing about it was it was just her arm, me being me I freaked out and ran to see where my mum was, she was sleeping on the couch."
Seeing myself in the mirror.
Okay so Basically I had on of those sleep paralasyse ( idk how to spell it xd) and my face was in the TV I had IT SMILED AT ME AND THEN JUMPED AT ME I screamed hella loud in my mind then I woke up and made a sound like mwaurrghh I decided that I stay under the covers after that.
"So, it was a nightmare i had when i was 11 on a school trip, it was the 2nd night there and i shared a room with my 3 friends, it was about a family but the parents decided to kill their 2 children at a pool for some reason, if you know the game you and your parents would play, where the parent would go ""1...2...3"" and throw you in the air to land back in the pool...well instead the parents in this nightmare did that, but then shoved the kids underwater to drown them, the second part of it was a picture with audio behind it, it was a story about some crap about the same story from the first part, but the picture was disturbing, it was two children ( boy and girl ) both falling with blood gushing out their mouths and really messed up teeth. i was horrified for the next 2 weeks, pretty spooky stuff."
hearing the panzer round noise at all on cod zombies
"I was about 9 or 10 and I was on the phone with my friend Jeremy were just talking about video games and I was about to ask him if I could come over when we both heard the loudest shrieking scream of a woman I've ever heard in my life and we both asked each other ""did you hear that?"" We both said yes and asked if each other if we were playing a trick on each other and i sure as hell wasn't and in my years of knowing him he's never even pulled the slightest prank so yeah kinda creepy.    P.s I have a couple of other creepy stories if anybody cares just ask"
"After my divorce I took a bottle of wodka.
I was not used to it.
I ended up in the hospital with 4.37 alcohol in my blood.
Lucky I survived."
"When I was young my mom and dad were having an argument (it wasn't anything serious) but we all knew that house was haunted because the house hot put up for sale when the old man there fell down the stairs and broke his neck and died 

Anyway when they were arguing one of them went upstairs and heard banging on the door and then loud footsteps going down the stairs, now this would be normal if my dad actually done that ,but he didn't 

Then a few days after that my mum mom goes to check on my little brother and she said she swore she could see a tall shadow towering over her 

We have since moved out but I still think about them times and it still scares me to this day"
"My bedroom use to be a dinning room so it has a big sliding glass door with a rod iron bar door on the outside that leads to the backyard. One night it was raining and i decided to leave the glass door open but keep the rod iron locked so i could enjoy the smell and sound of the rain. 

As i was laying in bed i vaugly saw the curtains move and i thought i could see something so i grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight. I just saw this short/small figure jump as i turned it on and that sent a wave of fear over me.

It turned out to just be my dog. He's a husky (not that it matters) and he had just slipped through the rod iron bars into my room. He got startled just like me when the flashlight came on."
"About 5-6 years ago I was maybe 11 or 12, I had gone up to our family cabin with just my grandpa. We were there for late deer season, and the snow had already covered the ground in late November. We had some strange experiences that day, but brushed everything off because we figured that cabin fever could grow if you let it get to you. That night we heard gunshots down over the holler, and figured that the older man who lived there was having a little practice. We felt perfectly safe considering that the cabin had been in my family for decades, and we’d never had anything like this happen ever before. Fast forward to around 10 pm when we got home and went to bed, we were going to wake up early around 4ish to go out to a tree stand we’d set. We started hearing footsteps going in circles around the cabin. My grandpa would yell out to anything making the crunching in the snow and it’d stop for a while but start again later. It finally stopped when we went to bed though. Next thing I knew it was 230 in the morning and my grandpa was shouting as loud as he could, saying things I’d never thought I’d ever hear him say. I had no idea what was going on but when he ran and shot his gun out the window into the darkness I knew it was the footsteps. He picked me up by the arm and dragged me out the cabin into his car and we drove 15 minutes to the nearest lit gas station. We slept there until morning and headed home. I asked him what he was shooting at but he never would tell me until around I got my license and asked him if I could bring my friends back up to the cabin, which he sternly said no to and told me that the land was cursed or something. He’d said that someone was out there that night and he believed it was his dead friend he’d lost in Vietnam. I would’ve thought he was crazy too if I knew he’d never had ptsd symptoms. But I do believe someone was out there. We have a running joke in my family where they think it was aliens. The cabin is close to the Greenbank Observatory in Pocahontas County, WV. My grandpa gets touchy when it’s brought up though..."
"Late to this, but my cousin and I were babysitting my younger siblings and also her son while my mom, aunts and uncles went to casino. Around 1am we were wanting something to eat and we both went into the garage where we had another refrigerator. Suddenly, we heard one of my little sister's toys had gone off inside the garage. We thought ""oh, it's all piled in the hefty bag so maybe it just got triggered by something."" So I go  to find it and turn it off and realized that this was the same pile we had taken all the batteries out from a week prior so we could take it to donate. I check all the toys in there just in case we've forgotten a toy or two and by this time my cousin starts helping me. ... Nothing. No batteries, nothing. We guess it might be from outside and from other children down the street and shrug it off. So we grab our little piece of cake and my cousin was about to turn the lights off when we hear the same toy make the same sound again... we both book it inside and tell my family when they get back and they all shrugged it off like it was nothing. I have more stories that are way creepier but this was one of the most creepiest."
"I was walking in the woods, I was all alone and my phone was dead, suddenly in the corner of my eye I spotted him,
Shia LaBeouf."
"I was sick with Cellulitis and had a 102+ fever. I was laying in my bed tossing and turning from the sickness, and quickly became delirious (although at the time I didn’t know that I had become delusional, it all seemed so real).

Anyway, while tossing and turning I guess I started having fever-dreams or hallucinations. The hallucinations were so real though. I was laying in my bed, and these shadow people would walk to the side of my bed and look down at me. They had no face, but a man, woman, and child all took turns walking into my room and staring down at me. 

I had no idea what was happening at the time, but looking back on it.... it gives me a chill."
"I was in bed and I think I was awake. This happened at night possibly a year or two ago and it hasn't happened since.

I was laying on my side facing a black office chair I have in my room that stands by my computer desk. My desk lamp was on so I could see everything very clearly.

I noticed a kid standing on my chair. I thought it was my younger brother as the child looked like him from behind but then I noticed the way his arms moved. They moved almost as if he was glitching. He didn't move like a human would. It seemed almost like he was sped up and his arms moved from spot A in the air to spot C without passing through spot B. His hands literally disappeared from one area and appeared in another and he moved weirdly fast. 

I could move, I was terrified but I was slowly reaching for my phone to take a video of him. My phone is always on the bed beside me so that wasn't a problem. Except in the moment when I glanced down to draw a pattern on my phone to unlock it, there was nothing on my chair anymore. I was really confused and still kinda scared but since then I have not seen that kid again. 

I even asked my brother the next day if he was in my room but he said no and even if he had been in my room, I would at least see him leave. I have no idea what that was and I hope I don't see it again."

"I was at a friends house and her mom was a hair stilyst, we were chillin on the couch when all of a sudden those plastics head you use to cut hair flew out, it made a huge noise and we rain upstairs to tell her mom. When we came back, the head was perfectly fine and was on the table."
"I’m not fucking kidding, when I was like 5, my uncle and I went outside and we saw a cat with glowing white eyes and the cats body was glowing white as well, it was so creepy my uncle ran up to tell the family but no one believed us"
I was in my room. My puppet started talking to me. (I was like 7). But i remember it clearer than i remember what i ate last night. It wanted to kill me. As it said that our house alarm went off.

"When I saw a demoniac. I saw some of them, but believe me, one it's enough."
"I have all sorts of sleep/dream experiences, probably less so in my older years. But back when I was a teen they were on high because.... I always was (high). 

Anyway one of the simplest but still creepiest was just waking up with my mom sitting my chest slapping my face with full force. I was just in a super slumber I guess. She's a nurse too so I imagine she must have been really sure something was wrong. Anyway I'll never forget just waking up to my nice little mom looking with wrestle-mania fire in her eyes ready to smack me again."
"I sometimes have a dream where I'm talking to someone of my family in a division of my house, and when I go to another division, the same person who I was talking to appears. When that happens I always wake up."
"Reading all these makes my own stories seem less creepy.

Anyway, it was a few years ago. I live out in the middle of nowhere but my mom and I were outside of the house talking. In the background was peepers, the collective term for insects and animals just making noise like crickets and frogs. 

But after a few minutes it all went silent. Just sudden dead silence. It wasn’t my hearing failing cause my mom and I were still talking, though we’d begun whispering for some reason. And after ten to fifteen minutes, the noises returned as if they hadn’t even stopped.


Another time was probably a decade ago. You ever heard some of the sounds a mountain lion makes? Some of them are like a child in severe, immense pain. Now imagine you’re just sitting around a bonfire bullshitting with your family and that starts up at random. I was terrified. And then my dad thought it’d be hilarious to try imitating the cry out loud. His imitation sucked, but the thought of whatever was making that noise deciding to investigate pushed my panic button."
"Encountering a prankster ghost when I slept with my head at the foot of the bed when I was a kid one time. I slept on an old water bed frame that had a cabinet at the foot and had a regular mattress inside. I fell asleep with my head at the foot of the bed but woke up when I felt the comforter pull up over my head. I freaked out and pulled it back where I had it and yelled at my sister to go back to her room. I layed back down and tried to go back to sleep but this time the entire blanket was yanked over my head and fell onto the floor. I jumped up screaming for my sister to get out and turned on the light only to find my room empty. I assumed she was hiding in the little cabinet and opened it up, telling her ""I know you're in there."" Guess who wasn't there. Also, guess who started sleeping in their dad's bed since that point."
I had a dream in which I was executed by medieval axe in my own bed when I was 10 years old. I still remember that dream.
Being born.
Reading these as I am home alone this night is fun.
"So I feel like I'm cursed but this started when I was around nine and it was a week after my birthday, I was up at 3 am playint dcuo on the ps4. behind me was my bunk bed i didnt sleep in the bottom part because it made me uncomfortable like as if somebody was watching me So I stretched and I do one of those weird fucking stretches where I lean all the way back and when I did I saw a fucking tall ass shadow watching my bunk bed and bet you the fuck not I ran to my moms room and stayed up there til it was time for school, And then after that every week after my birthday I get a visit from that fucker. A few years later we move out that house is still for sale and we decide to visit it and my mom goes to the door and peeks through the door window to see a dark shadow in pacing around in the kitchen THE LIGHT WAS ON and nobody was in the house as the driveway was empty as fuck so whatever ghosts or shit is in that house has attatched itself to me and it deadass changed me into someone who was happy all the time to someone who was angry, depressed, and suicidal.

Bonus story on the ghost fucker, I was in my bed after I had a fight with my mom and she came into my room and started praying, in the corner of my eyes I saw it sitting down in on the couch in the living room then stand up and disappear as my mom was praying, She noticed that I was silent and started praying louder. I hadnt seen it in awhile and I hope I DONT see it because bad events seem to happen after seeing it"
"I still think about the time some guy broke into our apartment, walked past me sleeping on the couch and assaulted my mom. I was woken up by the police. I was pretty young and can’t make sense how I slept through all of that. Seems like there’s more to the story."
When I walked in on my grandma sacrificing a bird for ‘the god’
"When I was about 6 or 7 my room was kind of a square, with a section of the roof slanting where my bed was. One night I had a horrendous nightmare, I lasted only a few seconds but I scared me really bad. 

In the dream, I was in bed and I felt someone rubbing my back with one finger, I was almost like someone was trying to tickle me, but were pushing too hard. I turned, and it was an old witch, like ancient. She had her hand stretched out, was wearing black robes and a hood (picture the witch from Snow White). 

I woke up immediately, but I still felt the feeling on my back, it was real, I swear I wasn’t imagining it. 

A few years later, after we moved out, I learnt that the house was haunted by and old lady who died in the house many years before."
"Sorry for the long story and also please excuse my grammar I'm not a native speaker.

In 7th grade we had a field trip to Austria and stayed there for a week. Everyone but us 6 girls were in a youth hostel. We were in an old hotel because there wasn't enough space in the hostel.

So our first night arrived and we all gathered in one of the three rooms. We started telling each other horror stories and then all spooked decided to have a sleep over. After everyone got their stuff from their rooms we locked the entrance door and sat down in the room again. We got cozy and again started with the story telling.

In the middle of one story we heard the old hallway outside of the room screech. We thought it was nothing till we heard the door knob rustle. 

We were dead silent for a moment. Me and another girl then went to look outside to see if maybe one of the boys were pranking us. When we reached the door and opened it the hallway was pitch black(it had some kind of motion sensor thing so when there is movement in the corridor the light turns on). We, creeped out locked the door again and went to the others.

After some more rustling and screeching we heard the doorknob being pushed down. So after what felt like an hour (was probably a minute but we were petrified) we went to check again. 

The fucking door was unlocked and mind you the door could only be unlocked from the inside when it was locked on the inside, which we did. So freaked out we locked it again and then noticed that the room next to the entrance had the light switched on and the door was nearly closed.

That room was were me and another girl had to sleep in and after I got my stuff i left the door open and switched off the light. 

Let's just say we didn't sleep in that room that week"
"I was about 12 years old. I was home alone. I had just finished my homework and I stood up from my desk in the sitting room. The door was on the other side of the room and the room was fairly big. I stood up and faced the door and there was this floating orb in front of it. It was dark grey translucent and it was about half a metre across, floating about a metre from the floor. I just stood there like what the fuck is this and then it changed, it was like a heat haze in a vaguely human shape, still about a metre tall and it started walking towards me. I was thinking /Im not having this bullshit/ so I took a few steps towards it thinking its go away, and it fucking,, went into me and I felt really cold for a second and then I just hid behind the couch for half an hour for my parents to come home.

Now since then (its been a few years but i still live there) every 2 months or so, Ive been hearing things while on the verge of sleep. Ive heard whispers mostly, once I couldnt understand what it said, another time it said ""night"" very clearly (it sounds female but it doesnt belong to anyone in my family), but the really scary one was a sort of, robotic voice talking about an apocalypse in the near future. It kept talking even when I was very awake. 

A month ago I was home alone again, I heard this policeman type banging on the door. I looked through the glass and no-one was there. I went back into the sitting room and then I heard really heavy footsteps at the other side of the house. I closed the door. I looked at my dog but it looked like he hadnt noticed anything. I then heard the radio in the kitchen (the room across the hall from the sitting room) turn on very loudly. I even recognised the radio programme. It got quieter, and then turned off. Then I heard these quieter footsteps, right outside the door, which stopped right outside the door. I heard a click. By now I was hiding behind the couch and my dog still hadnt noticed anything and my mam was supposed to be home half an hour ago. It all stopped then, though, and my mam was home a few minutes later. 

My entire family has heard footsteps in the attic and inexplicable banging on various walls multiple times. 

These were all pretty scary, Im not sure which was worse."

"This was recent, month of July, it was beginning of July when was on vacation and heading to see my fiance in another state. We live 8 hours apart, it's difficult sometimes but we always there for each other. So it was the middle of the night, I think it was around 10 AM or somewhere close to that, I had to stop to get some gas. 

So I manage to find exit ramp to a small town and found a gas station. The town looked sketchy, the roads were horrible and bumps everywhere. Place had a strange odor to, like sewage problems that never get fixed. So I pulled up to this gas station, I can't remember what it was called, it's a gas station I've never seen though. Got out of my car, paid for my gas and fuel my car. While waiting, I saw two people in a rusty red pickup truck. 

They looked pretty drunk, one tall scrawny guy with messy hair and look dirty. The other guy was short and fat, beer belly fat. There was a third day but he was in the truck and couldn't see him through the window. Scrawny tall guy was looking at me, quiet, had a weird look in his eyes. He saw me notice him and would turn away and talk to his buddy or something. I couldn't hear what they are saying at all. 

I kind of tried to ignore them but I had a deep creepy feeling inside me and my anxiety spiking. The car finished fueling and quickly put the nozzle away and got in my car. I locked my car quickly and kept the light off. Then a bang on my window on my passenger side and the scrawny guy was standing there with a weird half grin on his face. 

I freaked out, he tried to open the passenger side. I was so glad I locked it. I turned my car on and drove off, he backed off. I just left the town and back on the highway immediately. My heart was racing so hard. If I didn't lock my car, I wouldn't know what that guy would've done. I'm just glad I trusted my instincts."
"I'm a very lucid dreamer, and my dreams always follow a similar theme. Every place I've been can be mapped together, and I've been to certain cities and homes countless times. The stories are always fantastical, but this world is very concrete and interconnected, including occasionally reencountering old characters and plotlines.

Of note is that in every dream I am watched by something. He's nothing but a tall black silhouette (like shadow people) but I kind of brush him off these days. Whatever it is just watches harmlessly so I learned to ignore it. My creepy experience doesn't involve him though.

In my dream one night I was passing a graveyard and saw someone inside wearing traditional priest's clothes. I got the very distinct feeling that he was *real*. Another person, dreaming, somehow in my familiar dream world. He noticed me, and I could tell that he recognized it too. He approached me and tried to say something, I panicked and woke myself up. 

I know it was probably just a weird dream, but I remember him clearly, and I remember just how real and human he felt. I've had a lot of creepy things happen, but for some reason this stuck with me so strongly I could never shake it. Part of me even wonders if he's out there."
when you goes to restroom and in the middle of the main action you realise that that is just a dream
"I’m too old to remember exactly where this was (maybe St Augustine in FL or a fort in The DC area), but me and family went to an old fort in the US.  Huge parking lot, I’m talking Disney size parking lot, like thousands, and me and my family head to the fort to walk around.  This is in the late 80’s, very early 90’s.  I’m probably 10 at best.  I remember walking around the parapet with my family so happy and some crazy looking old lady carrying flowers asks my dad if he would like to by a rose for his lady (my mom).  He says no thank you (my dads much more charismatic than this and I’m sure made plenty of jokes and polite comments), and moves on.  She calls him by name and says some crazy ass horror movie witch like stuff.  He never told her his name.  He walks back to her and has a conversation about how she knew his name.  She says Satan told her and also said she should be at this location on this day to help him.  She pointed at me and my bother and said some more spooky ass shit.  My dad try’s talking to her and she says satan means for them to be together.  She looks like she’s got 20+ years on my dad at least.  He talks with her for a while trying to help her as she’s obviously nuts and eventually comes back to me, my brother and mom and says “keep moving, this old lady is not well”.  We walk the whole fort with no other weird events, but keeping our heads on a swivel.  We get back to our car to leave and there’s a dozen roses on my parents Rental Car with a note to my dad calling him by his first and last name.  It was hard for us to even find our car, the parking lot was so big."
"The first time I had sleep paralysis I was laying on my back. I had had sleep paralysis before, but this time was weird because I could feel that my eyelids were shut, but I could see around my room (I always keep some kind of small light on at night because I wake up several times through the night). Over in the corner by my bedroom door I can see two people, one about 6 feet all, the other about 5.5. They seemed to be talking to each other and looking at me. I tried to close my eyes, but they were already closed. I couldn’t say anything, as I still had sleep paralysis, so I was just thinking “go away, I want to go to sleep, I have work in the morning.” Eventually I feel myself coming out of the sleep paralysis, I feel my eyelids open, and the only thing different about the room is that the two figures are gone.

A few nights later I went to bed, still a little creeped out, but I said into my empty room “hey if you’re there, you can show yourself tonight. Just try not to creep me out.” Around 3am I woke up with sleep paralysis again, but this time I’m laying face down with my arms above my head and my face smashed into my pillow (it was so comfortable you have no idea). I was like “ah shit, again?” even though I had literally asked for this I guess. Then I feel someone grab my hair/the back of my head and start pulling me up. My whole body feels tingly when I get sleep paralysis, but as I’m being pulled up the tingling feeling feels stretched and like it’s tearing, like pulling apart a firm dough. After a few seconds of this, I suddenly can see the back of my head, and then as I go further up, I can fully see myself laying in the bed. I think as loud as I can “THIS IS SCARY PUT ME DOWN IM NOT READY” and as soon as I “say” that, I feel the hand on the back of my head let go, and I fall back down into my body and wake up. I immediately turned on my lamp and just sit on my bed, completely freaked out.

I stopped having sleep paralysis after that. Not sure if what I felt was “real” or not, but it scared the shit out of me nonetheless."
"One day i was home alone taking a nice nap, when i heard noises right out side my window. Thinking it was my father trying to fix something since he tends to get restless when there is nothing for him to do. So i thought nothing of iti prepared myself and got comfortable so that i can go back and continue my sweet nap, Then suddenly Something felt off so i decided to check the time on my phone which was right next to me, as i looked at the time i realized it was way to early for my father to be home. Just as i was saying that to myself i heard my window slide open immediately i looked up and was shocked to see a face peeking in through the window looking right at me. this whole moment was just surreal because i had just woken up from one of those naps where you forget time,day and location just out of it. the First words to come out my mouth were ""what the fuck?"" and then it all came back to me I realize this fucker was trying to break into my home, so i got up yelling ""you Mother fucker"" not even thinking about it i bolt towards him, (this was not an act of courage lol it was just like fight or flight so i charged him) the look on his face when i decided to go after him was amazing giving me that boost of Confidence to open the door and chase but the moment  i opened the door i remembered that my little dog was out there, fearing this fuck might have harmed my dog i stopped chasing and searched for my doggo only to find him sitting on a lawn chair starring at this whole thing go down, although he made it up by scaring off this giant Raccoon the next day. Anyways it got difficult going to sleep after that happened the thought of doing that again always kept me up lol until the feeling went away after a few days."
Looking in the mirror every morning
"Finding my dad( an alcoholic) fell down drunk in the kitchen, busted his head open and was laying in a pool of blood, i was the one who found him. There was so much blood i didn't know what to do( i didn't realise even minor head wounds bled a ton) once i woke him up he didn't know what was going on and kept trying to fight me thinking i did it to him. Luckily i called 911 and they stitched him up, he spent 4 days in the hospital and other than a huge scar on his head he was fine."
"Went to Vegas for a month and the whole time everything seemed on edge. People were rude all around. Whether it was customers or the staff, people just could not be civil with each other. Was not like any other trip I had before there. Had a very bad feeling so I went home early. Kept telling my wife that something seemed off. The next day is when the shooting from Mandalay Bay happened. I was going to be staying at the Luxor which is right next to Mandalay Bay."
"I was sleeping with my brother when suddenly a strong earthquake started. Earthquakes are pretty common where I live so I just say meh it’s going to end in a few seconds. But no, it went on for more time and when the windows starting shaking and my dog started barking I was concerned to fucking get out of my house. We have a kind of emergency bag but it’s just full of blankets, so my mom went to grab that and started shouting  at us to put on the blankets because it was freezing outside. I said fuck it and grabbed my dog and went outside ( btw I was barefooted). My cat got outside by itself but her kittens stayed inside because they didn’t even open their eyes. I imagined a lot of horrible stuff that could happen. Well then everyone started to exit their houses and the walls where shaking ( I live in an apartment complex) and my mf dog started barking at everyone and making the situation a bit scarier. The earthquake lasts for about 3 mins and there was no damage BUT IT WAS SCARY FOR ME.I Didn’t top shaking and didn’t sleep."
"I woke up but was still in a dream, I saw my mom walking out of the laundry room at probably 3 am(the laundry room is next to my room) I went out to the kitchen where she went, but before I could open the door to the living room/kitchen/dining room/stairs up to my parents room(there are no doors that separate any of them) I turn around and see the outline of a person in the guest room. I said who are you, as soon as I said it he fucking bum rushed me and was .0000001 millimeters away from my face when I woke up from that dream. To see my mom. At probably 3 am. Coming out of the laundry room. Heading to the kitchen.


(The guy had no fucking face and all black clothes almost like slender man but not tall and lengthy, more like my size and height)"
"This happened a little while ago, and its not going to be the creepiest thing on here, but it said the creepiest thing thats ever happened to me so here goes.

&#x200B;

SoI had gone on an outing with some friends of mine, and we were discussing some movies wew had watched and giving our opinions on them, and we reached a dead end road (We werent going somewhere specific, just walking around a nearby neighborhood). There was a large forest behind a few houses, so we went to hop the fence and talk in there. On our way down, a friend (We'll call him Tom) noticed an elderly man that looked abou in his late 60's to early 70'ss was giving us a stare, and we figured he didnt like us being on his property like that. So we all go back on the road and start walking the other way as to not get him to come out and yell at us. Well, he did anyway, except this old man took it to the next level. He had an old pickup truck parked outside on the street (it looked less than ten years old, but more than five) He made his way to the truck, and started the engine. Me and our friends all had madde our way mostly up the street by now, and didnt think much about it. Well, he started speeding toward us, in a directly obvious line coming right at us. we were in a group of four, including me, so we all just split up right away. We and Tom were both going in the same direction, and the man had followed us. I wasnt in the best shape, but I could run pretty fast if i needed to. We tried running in the grass, but nope, he followed us. We didnt want anyone else getting hurt, so we kept out of yards, and the next time I had loked back to see if hed caught up with us yet, the truck was just gone. We had only been running for about two minutes, and the truck was only going about 20-30 miles per hour. We had ended up looking at the same houser the next day, but the truck was gone. We peeked inside the house, and there was furniture inside it, as well as a litter box in the room we looked in. Still dont know what happened to the old man, but we moved shortly after.

tl;dr: old man got mad at a group of friends and chased us with a truck before dissapearing."
"So my step brother has a bear from his mom that passed away when he was like five (she died from cancer, dad passed away in car accident). He has had that bear his whole life. We then moved from small town Lamont to San Jose. We lived in an apartment for a while we looked for a home. 
Anyways, this happened in 2014, halfway thru June. My parents were sleeping and so were my brother and sister. It was me, my tablet, and that bear. I was in the living room and so was my brother. I was barely 13 at the time. I was watching videos for a while when 1:00 am came around. I was getting tired and was ready to sleep when I noticed that the bear fell of from the shelve. I got spooked but then just put it back. That is when my brother wakes up crying and just tell me don't hurt her. I asked who. That is when I heard a feeble voice say ""me"". It was so quiet yet so clear and I looked around to see where it came from. That when my brother screeched and I ran to the bathroom leaving the bear on the floor. I was sobbing and shaking on the bathroom floor. Then I heard someone knock on the door. It was my brother fully awake asking, ""are you ok"". I asked why did you yell and who did I hurt, 

he said, "" I never yelled. I was sleeping ""

I went out and the bear was back where it was, on that damned shelf as if nothing happened.  Didn't got to sleep till like four.

Two years later my brother gave the bear away.  
I never want to see a white bear in my life again."
"Right now after reading some of these stories, I decided to check the door locks to find out I had forgotten to lock both of them."
"This will probably get buried in the comments but

This happend about a year ago but me and my friend came home and heard someone inside my apartment when we were taking our shoes off in the hallway so instead of going in side of my apartment i ran up to the third floor and got my neighbor (who is a cop) to look aournd in my apartment he found all the glass on one of our sliding doors was broken and somone had just left"
"When I was 13 or 12 I used to get terrible nightmares and sleep paralysis very often. The creepiest one was, me listening to an old woman humming. And suddenly I woke up to my grandmother in the room cleaning, I didn't really thought much of it and decided to close my eyes again... But then I realized that my grandmother had wasn't home at the time and it would be impossible for her to get inside my room because I always lock the door before I go to bed, a few seconds later I hear loud noises of what sounds like a hammer banging from the inside of my closet, I open my eyes and I was struggling. I couldn't move or breathe, the banging became louder and was now accompanied with the laughter of a child, I closed my eyes and thought of my mom and dad, even my dog... After a few seconds the noise started to fade and I was able to move again. I had to sleep with my parents for the next two weeks after that..."
"Idk If it was creepy or just a gut feeling that let me hear it but I did.

So it was night time 10 pm or so. I had the Window open to our Garden. And we have shingle on our little ways everywhere. So if you would walk on then they would make cruntchy noice so you would notice that somone is coming around the cornore or so.

So I heared foot stebs. Must be from an Adult, because they were heavy steps. My gut feeling was coming up on me and the fear was tickelling my back. So I just lay there, dont know what to do.
There were two Persons, I thought. I just waited, untill I stod up and got to the room of my sister where my mother and sister sleeped.

I woke them up with tears in my eyes. Telled my mother somone was in our garden. She then got up down to the garage and looked there out of the window, you could see the garden from there and the paths. She saw no one. She got back and my sister huged me because I cryed and mumbeld all the time : "" I don't want to die. I don't want to die."" Idk why I said that. Atleast the people were gone then.

Maby they wanted to rob us or was it just an animal?"
"I dont know if this is really a experience but more like a alot of weird things happening when I was younger, I would open my eyes and close them when I was waking up and I opened my eyes and saw a man standing right by my face and I close them and I jumped up realizing what just happened.  

I would also wake up to use the restroom and i would look down my hallway and see a man bent over and I would just use the restroom and go back to sleep, I would only realize what happened when I woke up in the morning. But one of the scariest things that happen to me was I had a dream ( I hope) where my point of view was right above me and I could see my self sleep and at the edge of the couch (I was sleeping on) was a little girl with cuts all over her face. My point of view dropped into my body kind of and i woke up and look over to where she was and nothingl was there."
"Well I can't remember everything but I do remember a sound from under the bed but I didn't hear anything else. In the morning I told my mom about it but she didn't believe me, she's a christian. I even checked under the bed to see if  anything was under there but nothing."
"I actually saw slenderman in my parents bedroom. 

Nobody believes me but i'll tell the story. I woke up, it was arround 10 AM. There is a TV in my parents' bedroom and it was turned off. When I opened my eyes I saw a 2 meter tall person in the reflex of the tv in the bathroom. I froze. My body was shaking as fuck. I managed to run out of the bedroom to find my parents about it downstairs. When they got up it was gone.

I layed down in the same spot I was when I woke up and looked at the reflex of the tv and it was different from before. I'm 100% sure I saw Slenderman that day and i'll never forget it. It was the most terrifying thing that ever happend to me in my entire life."
"Home squadron was at Bergstrom, AFB 1952-55. 1954 attended a 6 month 43171 Flight Line mechanic course at Shepard, AFB. No contact with the home squadron during those 6 months. Return to Bergstrom and was filled in one of the crew chiefs had been badly burned and was evaced to the Brooke, Army Hosp burn unit. About 2 in the AM on CQ he appeared in front of me silently looking around and the vision was then gone. The orderly room phone rang and it was Brook Medical Center calling to say he had just died. Entered it in the log and informed the First Seargent in the AM."

"My father passed away unexpectedly.  I found him in his recliner, the TV was on. He looked like he was just sleeping.  That was 10 years ago this August. 

On Wednesday I found out that my uncle,  my father's brother passed away unexpectedly.  He was found in his recliner with the TV on.

Been creeped out for a couple of days now."
I was at kings Dominion and I was Six at this time but anyway I was at my birthday now my birthday is September 25  but I went to kings Dominion two days before now Halloween haunt was going on at this time and I did not know.  So when I got there I can't really remember what I did but at the end I noticed people were dressing up in weird costumes and make up so when we were about to leave it was night time and we were walking to the entrance/exit and these people we're just moving around weirdly and dancing creepily now I was with my grandma and mom and brother so my brother was also the same age at me at this time so my grandma picked up my brother and my mom picked up me and ran through the crowd it's actually pretty funny today but scary when I was six I haven't been to kings dominion for my birthday for a while.  But that's my scary story.
Talking to you
"One time at night I seen something that was small moved really fast. I could sleep for 1 hour. then I found it was my cat.

(Ps I was like 10 or 11)"
My life
"One word, Demogorgons."
"I have two stories, I will share the less creepy first.

I was 14 years old. I went to sleep normally. Suddenly, the coins and all the shit in the drawer besides my bed falls. I wake up to see my alarm clock signaling 3:30 AM, I try to go back to sleep thinking probably I threw them away during my sleep. Immediately after this, I start feeling a cat walking through my legs, I just think ""fucking cat, always doing the same"".  Problem was I HAD NO FUCKING CAT. As soon as I realize this I get up to see what is going and I feel a huge pressure above me that took me back to my bed. It is not exactly physical pressure, just like the pressure from a presence, it was heavy. I look above and see what I think is a huge shadow in the darkness. It looked like the Frankensein monster shadow, from which the pressure came from. I get inside my sheets and start praying hard on my mind until I fell asleep with no other problem.  


The next day I went to the movies with my then gf. We went to see The Exorcism of Emily  Rose, and during the posession scene I get cold when I realize it was basically the same exact sequence I had. (Also, my alarm clock was shitty and measured time wrongly, so sometimes it was off by some minutes, and that exact day, it was off by 3 mins. Being exactly 3:33 AM when that happened.)

&#x200B;

Let me say this again, this is my less creepy story."
"I woke up one morning and heard a creaking noise at my bedroom window, (there was a lot of construction going on at the house next door to mine but it was too early to be the builders) I peaked out of my window and saw someone climbing back over the fence using my window sill to lean on. I grabbed my phone and ran into the kitchen and had the blinds on a tilt so I could see out but no-one could see in; the guy then started cupping this hands to try and see into my house. I was already on the phone to the police whispering about what was happening, the 999 operator told me to stay quiet, but for some reason I decided to bang on the window and shout “PISS OFF!”. The guy started running, just then the police officer arrived at the front door, I told him the guy had run so he ran through the back door after him. They caught him and he had stolen some tools from the house next door but nothing major. Only trouble was I was then terrified he would come back, I didn’t live there for much longer after that."
The day after waking up next to your mom
I was in 6th grade. I went to a sleepover at my friends house. At about 3:20 I saw a man in all black looking through the window with a flashlight (the house was surrounded by a locked fence) . I hid under the covers and he went away. The window was open. I was ok and he didn’t come in the house.
"2 stories one weird one more creepy. 
1. I used to have my.dreams start with a claw coming out of.the ceiling and grabbing me. 
2 . This one is longer. One day when I was like 9  I was reading a book in my.bed, at night and i looked out the window. There was a man with a hoodie on, but one second he was there,and the next he just wasnt. He showed up more but I never really saw him do anything."
"For around two weeks the lights in multiple rooms in my home were super dim, like barely visible kinds of dim, and every time I entered these rooms I just felt complete fear, like I was being watched. Day in and day out these rooms were dim, even though all three of them had windows. Questioning my family about it nobody but me remembers this, but it was the scariest thing that’s happened to me so far"
I was walking to the bus stop next to the woods at 6:30 in the morning it was dark and i heard heavy thumping beside me and grass moving around then had to sit at the bus stop for 10 minutes
"Actually I have one more ( I l
Alreaddy commented) in my dreams constantly an owl would show on and I would feel extreme amounts of terror. It  would make a noise I can only describe as shreiking, but it was not birdlike or human. Nobody else in my dreams noticed it."
"I was playing video games while home alone and felt a hand on my shoulder. No one in the room, no one in the house. This has happened twice."
"One night while I was coming back to my apartment after dinner at my in-laws I got followed by some random guy. It wasn’t late, but it was winter, so dark already. My husband was gone on a work trip and of course the parking lot was full so I had to walk alone with my baby across the lot. This early twenties looking guy looked like he was going into an apartment that I had to walk by. But as I walked by he stepped away from the door and I heard him behind me. At this point I was on the sidewalk on the side of my building and away from the lot. I figured he just forgot something in his car, but when I turned around to look he was right behind me. He immediately turned around and walked the opposite direction. I got my baby into the apartment as fast as I could while making sure he didn’t see where I had gone in, locked the door and turned off all of the lights. 

Whenever I tell someone this story they act like I’m paranoid. But there was no reason for him to be behind me, and I have never been so freaked out about something. It still makes my heart race thinking about what could have happened."
"So a little background to this, but I was living on my own after leaving my abusive, rapist ex and reporting him and taking him down, this happened during the wait for the trial.

So since I left with nothing I didn’t have a lot of furniture and at the time I was sleeping downstairs on my sofa while my daughter had the bed upstairs, I also didn’t have any curtains yet but it wasn’t too bad because it was a quiet area.

I woke up in the middle of the night and saw a shadow move across my wall, so I look out of the living room window and there’s a tallish figure wearing a baseball cap standing RIGHT up against my window, the figure has an identical silhouette as my ex.

My heart starts pounding and I don’t know what to do, I was convinced he was going to come and kill me as he promised before I left, then I remember my daughter, so I think fuck it, and run as fast as I can upstairs to her bedroom getting ready to call the police. As I’m doing so I can hear laughing...but it sounds different from my ex? 

I creep into the second bedroom that over looks the front of the house and it turns out it was just my neighbour.

Why the hell they were at the top of my driveway right up my window is anyone guess. He does look a lot like my ex and the woman next door knows of my situation, yet they carried on doing things to scare me, needless to say I quickly had enough and moved out of there.

Thankfully now all my neighbours are amazing and kind and look after me and my daughter. 

TL;DR- I woke up and thought my ex who said he would kill me, was standing outside my house and freaked the fuck out. Turns out it was a lookalike."

I saw the same woman while looking out the buss window 3-4 times allong the way. The buss drove past her and then i sas her again further along. It's not possible that she was that quick...
"I was around 9-10, and standing in my shared room with a polar bear blanket wrapped around me. I stood in the middle of the room, next to my bed and my little sisters bed. I looked out the dark backyard window, because we were currently renovating my parents house and panting, so we had to take of the blinds. As I looked out the window, I saw a large male, in all black smiling at me. My blood went cold, and I walked out of the room, scared out of my fucking mind. My sister was around 7-8 at the time, and I didn't want to scare her, so I didn't tell her. And when I DID tell my aunt, she dismissively told me it was a dream. But I know it wasn't. So when we shopped for new curtains, I made sure to get blackouts."

"I used to have one with call about arrest fight mother, which is sort of like a caregiver that is allotted to the parent of a special-needs child whom they can send that child to for a period of time for the sake of their own sanity. I would occasionally visit her and her husband every second Saturday. Eventually this woman suffered a psychological break following several deaths in her family including her son who was in jail and her sister who had mesothelioma.

Anyways, one day out of the fucking blue she just barges into our house and have tea with us. When I say barges I mean neither of us knew she was coming over and she just walks right in without knocking.

I was like 11 at the time and the resultant hour-long conversation, which involved her regaling us with her various conspiracies about the government monitoring Us through implants in our foreheads up our asses, and how her husband was God in life, and how her son was saved from death by like magic or something, was perhaps one of the more eerie situations that I've ever been in.

At one point during the conversation she circled around me and started fiddling with my hair out of nowhere. I'm autistic, so as a rule I don't really care for being touched by surprise, but this set me off super hard.

Eventually she leaves under her own power and I just tell my mom to lock the door. That incident never happened again, but only because for whatever reason every time she came around to converse with my mother she kept her distance because of whoever my mother was talking with on the lawn at the time and then just left."
I’m so sorry for you
"I woke up to my demented grandpa standing in the door opening and watching me with the light's on behind him making him just a black outline of a man.

I'm a deep sleeper so he was standing there for a while before I finally woke up but when I did for what felt like minutes I was overcome with fear but then I realized it was my grandpa I told him to go downstairs and go to bed. I just closed the door and went back to sleep."
"This was about a month ago. Me and my friend had this place that we use to hang out at. We called it the creek and it was pretty far back into the woods. I keep a machete there and my friend kept a baseball bat just in case. We go down there one day and I notice my machete was missing but the bat was still there, so he grabs his bat and we continue into the trail. We notice there are a few condom wrappers and a little baggy (probably had drugs in it). We stop and investigate and then we hear a noise in the bushes besides us. We look over and there is a half naked man holding my machete. We instantly get up and run just about as fast as I think I ever have. We got our of the woods and we haven't gone back since."
I love you
When I was younger I was home alone so I went over to hang out with my neighbor who was the same age as me. We hung out and decided to go back to my house to grab lunch since his house didn’t have anything we wanted. While we were making food I jumped up and down three times (I don’t really know why so don’t ask lmao) and almost immediately after I heard another three stomps on the group like someone was mimicking me directly above the kitchen ceiling. (Which would of meant the sounds were coming from the master bedroom bathroom) Needless to say we ran out of the house pretty fast after that since we knew we were home alone. Once my parents got home I told them about the incident and we went upstairs and a few of the cabinets were open and the closet door was jammed shut.
"(I’m 16 btw) I was on a trip in New York City for spring break this year with some people from my school’s band including a 14 year old friend of mine. Me and this friend went into one of the “I <3 NY” shops. After I got what I wanted, I stood outside by the entrance to the shop and waited for her. When she came back out, she was visibly red so I asked her what was wrong and she said the (middle aged male) cashier told her she looked very cute. The chaperone we were with overheard her and went inside and yelled at the cashier. Never went inside one of those shops after that.

On that same trip, we were walking through time square heading to the Disney store. We walked by the crowd of people dressed as mascots. One of them, a man who was dressed as a Cookie Monster, has the head part (idk what you call it) of his costume off. He noticed me and my friends walking by and put his head thing on and started walking toward us with his arms outstretched as if he wants to hug us. He came toward me first. I have autism and don’t like being hugged, especially by people I don’t know, so I quickened my pace, very obviously not interested but he kept coming at me. By this point, the same chaperone I mentioned earlier started yelling “No no no no no” at him but was too far back to do anything. I freaked out and started repeating her, yelling “no no no no no no” but the guy kept coming. Right before he could hug me, I ducked under his arms and lightly jogged away from him. He tried the same thing with my friends, who also ran from him. I stayed right next to the chaperone after that.

Yeah I don’t think I’m going to NYC for a good long time. There were plenty of other stories from that trip, but I don’t feel like typing them out. That place is wild. I enjoyed the good parts of it though."
"My great-aunt told me this story about her and her husband. Random guy broke into house and husband was in garage working on something late at night. Great aunt saw the dudes face looking in the window followed by the dude getting blasted full of buckshot by her husband. Dude actually survived and later admitted to trying to do some horrible crime or another, I forget that detail."
"Up in the Sierra Nevada mountains visiting family, about 15 years ago. Me and my friend rode my grandparents golf cart around their property and up and down the mountain roads the whole trip. One night, way past dark, we snuck out for a joy ride. We had forgot to charge the battery though. So we got a pretty good distance from the house, and started hearing strange noises. We realized after a few minutes it was a mountain lion, and it started ""screaming"" if that's the right term. We lost our shit, and tried to GTFO but the return trip was all uphill and the battery wouldn't get the cart up the hill. We had to jump out and push it a bit, and the whole time I just knew I was gonna get pounced on. We got away, but damn was it scary. 

Then, after we got back, my dad decided to mess with us. He knew we had been out, so he jumped out around the house at yelled at us and we both about had a heart attack lol."
"Sorry if it’s hard to read, I’m on mobile

This ones weird, because to this day I have no idea wtf happened. So this happened about 6 years ago, I was 10-11 at the time. I’m at my house watching YouTube, and the power randomly goes out. it wasn’t raining at all. It was pretty late, like 10:00, and that was past my bedtime, so I just went to sleep. I woke up at exactly 3:34 am, I still remember looking at my clock. The power’s still out, and I try to go back to sleep. Then I start hearing very faint footsteps. They were outside, thank god, but whoever it was was in my backyard. I was pretty freaked out, but I tried to ignore it. Then I look out my window and see a faint light outside. I keep looking and it’s coming closer.  Eventually I see the silhouette of a man, maybe 10 feet from the window. He keeps coming closer, to the point where he was outside my window, shining the light directly into my room.  I’m almost entirely under the covers now, trying not to scream.  My bed was at an angle where I don’t think he could see me, but I’m not sure.  After maybe 10 seconds, he looks to the side, and then takes off running.  
To this day I have no idea what he saw, or why he was here, and as far as I know he hasn’t came back since. Just recently I moved out of that house, and it’s made me remember that. I get chills every time I think about it."

"I’m Schizophrenic so my sleep paralysis tends to be extreme in the sense that even when I get out of it I can still see what was there anyway. I also have sleep paralysis about 3-5 times a week so I have many stories but there’s this one where I couldn’t shake it off easily. I took a nap because I just got home from the movies and I was exhausted and it was like 80-90 degrees in Cali. I remember I fell asleep on my back which is the best way to induce sleep paralysis but at the time I slept like this because my ceiling fan was putting a breeze on my body so I didn’t think much of it. Anyway, I end up in my paralyzed state and I can see my room, or at least the wall I’m facing and a bit of my door. It’s quiet and I at first don’t see ANY figures but from the side of my bed this 8ft fucking shadow figure rises and I remember he kept mumbling and after standing at full height he started to lower himself inch by inch and kept getting louder. I of course was doing everything to wake the fuck up but it was like my body was not responding quickly and he gets in my face and screams “BE CAREFUL! YOULL GET HURT! BE CAREFUL! WATCH OUT! BE CAREFUL!” Then headbutts me which makes me launch up out of bed and wake up. This happened recently and I still think about it ALOT"
"Was watching MatPat's FNaF 1 theory video right? When I got to the part where the dot on the screen representing the murderer left the bathroom to start his killing spree, at the exactly instance when he walked through the door to where people were, the bedroom door (which was shut) behind me creaked open on its own.

I never get creeped out so I didn't really care :P"
"So a bit of backstory my nan used to live in a mid century home it was about 50 years old so every wensday after school i would go to her house (not even a minute walk from my old school to her house) and we would regulary have sleep overs there because it was always fun. so one day after school it was the last day of school so we had about 1 and a half months off (im in australia) i made a hot chocolate and put it on the bench all of a sudden on a flat bench the cup slides across as its happening my nan walks in sees and she is in shock so it stops and i said to her ""see i told you this place is haunted"" so i grab my hot chocolate and walk into the lounge room sit down and watch tv so now im linking in my head what caused this i know that her next door neighbors husband died from playing some board that lets you talk to ghosts so i thought it was that next day we went across the road to my nans friends house when we were walking a it got cold for a second minding you it was about a 35° day with no wind at all so in the end she moved houses into a bigger house and nothing weird has happened yet."
"Not so much creepy but it definitely weirded me out. I was walking through the centre of town where I live with my earphones in, just having a wander and doing some window shopping. I’d popped into a shop to grab an energy drink and I’d taken my earphones out then put them back in as I’d left. 

Cracked my drink open and begun walking again, only to hear someone shouting “OI! OI YOU!” At the top of their voice. I turn my head slightly and it’s some guy about the same size as me running toward me... I stopped with my back to him, and asked him “what!”...

His reply was a question which was simply “don’t you get on the number 3 bus regularly?” I don’t live in that direction of town so I said no...

I went to turn to face him but he followed me round so he was still behind me, so I got a bit arsey about it. I said “I’m pretty fucking sure what bus I get, and it ain’t that one!”

He looked puzzled, simply “OK” and went walking back toward the number 3 bus stop.

Weirded me out when it happened as I had no idea why he’d not want me to face him when talking to him."
"I sometimes see ""dead people"" in various locations, usually out the corner of my eyes, never directly looking at them.  This has been happening to me since I was  young.  I used to see a native americans silhouette in the shadows where I grew up at night in our house, usually when I would get up to go pee or something. I could clearly see the shadow at times.  After I had lived there about 12 years the college near me was doing research in the area where I lived for native american burial sites based on history of the area.  it turned out there was 4 graves in our back yard that no one even knew about.  Kind of creepy stuff"
"I was at a game store to meet up with my friends to play MTG. I forgot my wallet in my moms car so she gave me her keys and I walked to get my wallet. After I closed and locked the door, this man that cant be younger than 60 hops in front of me, and starts talking some pedo shit. My head was freaking out, and I just ran into the street to get around him. He was in the store earlier and was acting like a wizard. Something wasnt right with him because it turns out he followed a young mom down the street earlier and was *apparently* going to try and steal her baby."

"As a child (probably 8-10 range, don’t remember exactly) was walking on suburban road and some older dude asked me to help him push his riding mower up his driveway into his garage.  My spider sense tingled and I noped the fuck outta there.  Maybe it was just an old man that needed help, but something about it told me that he would be just strong enough to overpower me if shit went down, and that was enough for him to push his own goddamn mower."
"I lived in an old Victorian house with a few others during uni, and it had been cared for terribly over the years. There was tons of black mould (plenty of it in my room), it was so wet in there that you could see water vapour in the air at night through torch beams, and the power and fire alarm would go off at random. Oh, and there was a ghost. 
One housemate felt watched, another would hear a whisper right in his ear in the dead of night, and I had it touch me. I was lying on my bed one day, about 3pm, after a lecture. I was wide away, scrolling on my phone with one hand while the other hung off the bed. I suddenly felt a hand grab mine. It was firm, not painful, but scared the crap out of me."
"A guy (former pastor of my best friend's church and his ex-gf's dad) offered my best friend and I $5,000 each to have sex with each other in front of him.

When he first brought it up I cracked up laughing because I thought he was joking. Of course we said no and he kept upping the offer all the way to $10k each.

We realized he wasn't joking and maybe all the rumors and allegations of his behavior were true. 

We ran out of there as fast as we could. Haven't seen or spoken to him since."
"When i was about 16-17 i went shopping with my mom in a little grocery store, it was really busy that day  so a lot of people had to squeeze past each other to move. My mother tells me to stay put at a part of the store with hair stuff and she then goes off to get something.

I stand there leaning on a glass counter waiting for her, while trying to move aside so others could past. Suddenly i feel someone directly behind me, i move forward a bit to let them pass, but so do they. Then they decide to ""grind"" on me. i feel so shocked and  disturbed i cant believe it, so after while i confirm that this is not some kind of mistake i slowly turn around and at the same time they stopped what they were doing. I saw a tall woman wearing a red shirt and a man much taller than her in a green hat and then i quickly turned back around.

Just after they moved my mother came back, i whispered to her what had transpired and she wanted me to point out the person. I told her not to bother ( as i did not want to cause a scene), but at the same time i saw the man with the green hat walking out the door, he didn't buy anything and i just watched him. The mens section was on the other side of the store so why was he here?

I dont know if to describe this as creepy or Just extremely disturbing."
"One night coming home from work at 2am on a dark street I heard a dog bark like at the end of the street, I thought it must be someone's dog barking in a backyard, so I continued. Suddenly 6 dogs are running for me, I froze for a moment that I had like a pump of adrenaline it felt like my heart was pumping 5 times the blood and at that second I started running, but, running for the dogs, then I opened my arms and started growling and shouting arrrrggggg. When the dogs were like 2 meters in front of me they stopped and ran away from the direction they came. I ran for about 30 meters chasing them and at a crossroad they went in different directions. I walked slowly to my building hearing the dogs barking very distant, they didn't follow me anymore. It was very scary at first, they were very big stray dogs and at night they get very territorial."
"When I lived at my old apt, sometimes I would take my Rottie to poop in a nearby undeveloped lot.  Late one evening, my dog started barking at something and wheb I looked up into a tree, I see a dude there hugging a limb staring at us not moving at all.  The dude was wearing all black, ski mask, white gloves, and weirdo reflective goggles.  He looked like an insect just watching us.  Creepy AF!  I backed out of there, slowly keeping my eyes on him until I was out of there."
Seeing my father yell at my mother which let to their divorce
"When I was around 18-20 I had a fascination with abandoned buildings. In particular there was a very large abandoned psychiatric hospital not far from me. It had about a dozen or so separate buildings and I loved to explore them. Now, I'm aware people squat in abandoned buildings, and saw signs of people living there, but always brought a pocket knife for protection and tried to be cautious. But one day I ran into something a bit different. 

There was one building that to get into you had to climb in through a window that led to a sub-basment (idk if this is the right word, but that floor of the building was only half below ground). Me and my friends climb in and we walk a bit heading to the stairs and I turn a corner and stop dead in my tracks.

 Standing there is a man, dressed in all black like an old preacher from the 1800s, wide brimmed hat and all, and next to him is a woman in a completely white flowy white dress holding a small dog. We all stood in silence staring at each other for about 20 seconds until the woman said ""we're not cops"" (no shit, really?) which for some reason was reassuring to me  so I responded ""neither are we"". Then they asked if we knew where the morgue was. We said no and they walked off in another direction. Scared the shit out of me."
"I have two:

1) Once, when I was 12/13yo, me and my mother went to the restaurant together. On our way back home, at around 10pm, we see a homeless person with a dog. They were walking towards us, on the same sidewalk as us. I LOVE dogs, so I told my mother ""Look, he's got such a cute doggie!"" as I always do whenever we see a dog. 

When he arrives at our level, the homeless man grabs my arm pretty strongly, and say ""I'm gonna tell you a secret!"" I was terrorised, so I didn't move or say anything, I just looked at my mother like ""PLEASE DO SOMETHING QUICK"". The thing is, my mother has had multiple diseases, and really isn't in position to physically defend me or herself.

So they just started arguing, my mother telling (almost yelling at) him to let me go, and the man refusing to do so. He said multiple things, but I clearly remember only one of them: my mother said ""You don't know her"" and he screamed ""OBVIOUSLY I know her! Everyone here knows her! Even my dog knows her!! And we know you TOO!"". Just so you understand how strange and scarry that man and these 5 minutes were.

When he finally let me go, we quickly walked away from him. But when we were 5 or 10 meters away from him, he shouted ""Don't worry, uh! I'm not a rapist! Or almost...""

That was the scariest thing anybody ever said to me. +I knew that if he wanted to chase us, we couldn't run away because of my mother's physical condition.

&#x200B;

2) Once, when I was 10, me and my family came back from vacations (it was a 10 hours long trip, in a small car) so I was exhausted (I can't sleep in cars in case you're wondering). When we finally arrived, I jumped in my bed. As usual, I had an insomnia, and I didn't fall asleep until 1am at least. But just before I fell completely asleep, I heard somebody/something whispering EXTREMELY close to my ear ""Welcome back home..."" I was terrorised, hid under my bedsheets, and only 15 minutes after it happened, I ran to my parent's bedroom, in tears."
It was one am I was up reading reddit when I heard my back door sliding open/close. After that I spent a few minutes hyperventilating. Then I grabbed my baseball bat and went to the door to lock it. The second i did that my dad banged on the glass he had gone out for a smoke. So pretty anticlimactic but still scared the shit out of me.
"Serving a few months for DUI, got sent on a court trip. Spent some time near one of the most evil fuckers on the planet. Google “Cheshire Petit murders.” The older one. He was transported in a segregated plastic box in the prison bus. Other inmates were yelling at him, child rapist, murdering scum, all that. Dude just... stared ahead. In his own world."
"He was taking a shower alone in the house, when the shower curtain started pushing in towards him. So much that he thought it was me, and called out from the shower “haha, funny” or something like that. When he didn’t hear a reply, he looked out and realized he was alone. I thought maybe it was the air kicking on, he said it was exaggeratedly pushed in, like 2/3 of the way in."
"Im sure something worse is bound to happen but for about a month when i was about 13 id feel like someone was watching me at night

I had to hide under my blanket to sleep, and sometimes after i went under my blanket  id have a strong feeling like i was gonna die
Like i felt like a hand was reaching twords my face 

Yeah years later and now i cant sleep cuz im hallucinating maybe faces in my room
Not as scary as the previous one but it adds up"
"Buried at this point, but when I was about 7-8 years old my mom told me to grab my spelling book out of my backpack so we could study.  I went into the room where my backpack was and as I reached for it, it started shaking like there was an animal inside of it.  Instantly got scared and ran back to the kitchen.  Mom assures me there is nothing wrong with my backpack and basically insinuated I was trying to get out of studying.  Go back to my backpack and open it up to find nothing inside of it.  Still don’t know what the hell happened that night and after all these years I wonder if it is even a real memory or just a dream that scarred me."
"When I was a young teen I would bike by myself (only child, friends lived further away) to the same field in my neighbourhood for years. It was super peaceful and open with a hedge all the way along the perimeter between the field and the country roads. I pretty much never bumped into another soul on this trail. On one of these trips I had a bad feeling like I shouldn’t be going by myself on that day and decided instead to bike around the field on the country road. 

As I was halfway around I could see the furthest point of the field I would usually reach and turn around but instead of being empty, there stood a man in a mustard yellow shirt, tie, suit trousers, creepy glasses (think Mr Harvey from The Lovely Bones) and the feeling it gave me in the pit of my stomach was terrifying. He probably was doing the same as myself, trying to find some peace and quiet but his attire just creeped me out so much for the setting. Anyway I cycled home as fast as my legs would let me and never went back to that field ever again"
"There was a serial killer on the loose in my city when I was a kid. He'd escaped from prison and had killed 4 people while he was on the run, over the course of several months. No, I didn't run into him.

But, rumour was, that he'd run to my home town. To the parish actually, and was at a relatives at least very briefly (she was an elderly woman who volunteered a lot at the parish). Possibly she turned him back out onto he street? Rumours, anyway, who knows. Her son was seen pacing around the church between masses, muttering like he was having some sort of panic attack one day. Then shortly afterward, the jailbird was seen across town at a pub (around the corner from my high school). He took off after being recognized, and was cornered by police along a highway a few hours later.

It wasn't much of a brush with a serial killer. But it did creep me out for a couple of reasons. He was supposedly into satanism, and targeted church-goers (one of his victims was a priest, others were known to be church regulars). And the proximity I guess. He was a maniac. Glad he's locked up again.

""Monsters"" spring up anywhere though, I believe. We've all had brushes with them. Even if we don't know it at the time. That's... creepy."
"Any power cut.

But this one time I was listening to the radio and it just cut to static and a mans voice counting down from 10 to 0 very slowly. On every frequency."
Finding a creeper when mining diamonds
"He was taking a shower in the house by himself when the shower curtain started pushing in towards him. He said it was so exaggerated that he thought it was me on the other side, and started talking to me. After there was no reply, he stuck his head out and realized there was no one there. After he told me, I asked if maybe it was the air that kicked on, he said it was pushed in like 2/3 of the way, and there was no way it was from the air."
"I am 37 so it is about 30 years ago when i had my own bedroom next to that of my parents. One night i laid in bed with the lights off and noticed a sound in my head. The sound started out soft and barely audible, it was continuous like an engine and slowly became louder and more textured. After a while the sound became very loud and i started to get a bit frightened, i remember going to my parents bedroom and saw their confusion as i was clearly distressed but unable to make them understand what was going on. The sound had become so loud and overwhelming i started to panic severely even as i was clinging onto my parents.

When i tried to shut it all out by closing my eyes i suddenly found myself in absolute silence. When i openened my eyes to see/hear if the sound was there, the sound made its presence as if it exploded with a giant bang. I closed my eyes and eventually fell asleep in my parents bed, from the next day on it never happend again.

The sound itself was incredible and i can only describe it as two gigantic metal ships scraping their hull against eachother in a collision that never stops and always gets louder. Perhaps it is not so much the experience that is creepy because it was absolute terror to me as a child, but the idea of looking back and knowing this is something a person could experience gives me the absolute shivers."
"While in high school in El Paso, a guy offered to suck me off for money. He did this in spanish and I thought he was joking."
Creeper
"One time while talking about demons with my mom (grew up in a really religious family) an empty glass broke abruptly. As my mom wad saying it was the devil trying to scare us and jesus would keep us safe my old handheld video game turned on by itself when the switch was set to off. 

nothing else happened, but it scared the shit out of me as a kid"
"I used to do deliveries for a Chinese restaurant which does out of town deliveries due to my town being surrounded by villages etc. One time my gf was with me and I had a delivery to what’s classed as a village but it’s just maybe 12 houses close together on a bendy back road. All the houses are named with no numbers and a lot of them have massive drives so it makes them hard to find, especially at night. When we got close to the “village” I pulled over next to a gate to a field just to get off the road and call the customer for directions just to make it easier and save time. As I spoke on the phone my gf tapped my arm and pointed straight forward but I just ignored her and listened to the person on the phone. Once I hung up a few moments later I asked what was wrong and she asked “can you see someone there?” I looked out and could see someone marching towards the gate from maybe 20 metres away. (Had my full-beam on) straight away I was thinking fuck this I’m not trying to die here. So I slammed into reverse and when I started moving he started to sprint, as soon as this happened my blood turned to ice. The creepiest moment of my life. My gf still says that he was carrying some sort of weapon but I can’t say for sure. A mate of mine stays on the road leading to the “village” and he’s said for years that creepy shit just always happens around there."
"At night, I went to the toilet and when I came back I found a pile of diarrhea on my bed. No one owned up to it of course"
"(Ive posted about this once before so I'll be brief) 

I was very drunk and a guy even more drunk comes onto me while alone on the porch outside my friends birthday party. I turn him down several times but just wouldnt take no for an answer as he poked my side with his half a boner. He claimed he knew I was way too drunk to go home. That he knew I'd be sleeping on the couch. (Which was the original plan. I planned to get wasted and let lose for once.) Said that he would come find me later and **make** me change my mind. 

Creepiest party experience I've ever had. I never thought it would happen to me because I'm no 10. I'm a 5 at most and that's being generous."
"Walking to the bus stop for school at 5:45

Spooky as shit"
"I had a boyfriend that sleepwalked.  One of the first nights we spent together I woke up at 2 in the morning with him out of bed and standing at the foot of the need staring at me.  I asked him what he was doing, he said I am not sure.  I said I am going back to bed and he is welcome to join me.  He crawled into bed next to me, and didn't remember anything in the morning.  It's still unnerving to recall a shadowy figure looking over me when I awake."
"I used to work at a haunted attraction.  Sometimes I did set construction or makeup, but a few times I acted.  The attraction is in an old factory where there have been over a dozen recorded deaths.  Most people who spend time there have a few ghost stories.  

One night I decided to do some acting and got set up in the hospital set with a group of other actors, including two who were part of a ghost hunting team.  They had performed a number of investigations on the property.  During some downtime between customers we gathered in middle of the set and one of the other actors began complaining that something had grabbed his leg.  The two ghost hunters begin telling some story regarding what they'd determined about some of the spirits, claiming there was a little girl that haunted the area because her mom's spirit was searching the factory for her lost son and wouldn't let her leave.

Now, I believe in ghosts, but I also take everyone's ghost stories with a grain of salt.  Especially stories from actors.  But the place did have a spooky vibe and I had felt a few pokes and prods while in the building.  I notice one of the actors was whispering to a spot near his elbow.  I rolled my eyes, but after a little while the air around me turned oddly frigid.

I asked the actor what he was doing, and he responded that he was telling her to make her presence known.  I brought their attention to the cold spot and we all marveled about it for a few seconds before the next group of customers started down the stairs and we had to resume our positions. 

My spot was alone on a balcony where I could scare the customers as they were going into the hospital, and as they left.  As I was sitting there alone i felt the cold pocket again, and being by myself in the dark made it even more unnerving.  I totally believe in the possibility of ghosts attaching and following a person home (happened to my sister when I was a kid, but that's another story).  I told the cold pocket, ""Hey, just so you know.  You aren't allowed to follow me home.""

For the next few minutes I felt the sensation of a hand clamped around my wrist.  I could move around unhindered, but there was a pressure and when I held my hands up to the light the affected one was white as though the circulation was being cut off.  

After a while the sensation lifted and the coloring returned to normal.  Definitely the most intense experience I had there.  Since then just the occasional butt poke or hair tug.

Tldr: a ghost held my hand in the dark for a while even though I said it couldn't go home with me."
***THE NEW MINECRAFT CAVE SOUNDS***
"Having sleep paralysis and seeing a demon-looking thing looking at me from my closet, slowly moving closer until I woke up fully."
"When I was maybe ten or nine, I moved into a brand new house with my sister, mom and dad. Once I fell asleep in my sister's room, and she went downstairs so she wouldn't bother me. 

So at one point, I wake up at like maybe eight or nine PM because it's completely dark outside. There was also a thunderstorm at that time. The way my sister's bed was placed made it so my back was to the wall, and the closet. Suddenly, I start hearing all these voices and whispering all around me. I get freaked out and think about running downstairs.

When I was about to get up, I heard the closet door swing open, and it was creaky too so it made it ten times worse. At this point, I'm completely bawling my eyes out and screaming for my sister/dad. Then I hear a loud thump beside my head as if somebody jumped next to the bed. I covered my ears and continued to cry because I was so mortified until I got up and ran downstairs crying. 

I doubt it was real since I hallucinate a lot when I'm sick since I don't have much of an appetite, so that might explain it. Nonetheless it was scary as hell for me."
"I had made a ouija board with my two friends one night cuz we were bored. It ""worked"" but didn't give us anything interesting or noteworthy, other than the fact that it led us to believe we were talking to my dead grandma. 

Fast forward a week later and my cousin and Aunt are visiting, so we decide to give it a go along with my mom. After a bit, we ask if the spirit was my dead grandma (both my mom and aunts mom). It says yes and my mom goes ahead and says ""if this is you, mom, turn off that light over there in the corner"". 

None of us believed anything would happen, and nothing did at first. It was only until we began to ask another question and the light turned completely off. It was the only light on in the room, so we were left in the pitch black. We all screamed in disbelief until it finally turned back on after what felt like an eternity. 

I spent a whole lot of my childhood in that room and never experienced any shorts in the electricity or anything like that. It also only happened with that light , nothing else in the house. I refuse to believe it was a coincidence and this is the main reason I believe in the supernatural to this day. Worst of all I had to sleep in that room that night."
"Okay so I used to sleep pretty solidly (I was 14 when this happened) I didn't move in my sleep either, because I had kittens that used to crawl in to bed with me, I also slept on my side/back never any other way and I slept in a room with my two younger sisters. Me and my younger sister who we'll call B slept on a bunk, she had the top one I had the bottom one, my youngest sister who we'll call K slept on a mattress by the bathroom. We were all scared of the dark so we'd always sleep with either the TV on or the bathroom light on with the door cracked, but this night we didn't. 

Also important was I had a put up some thin curtains (tucked under the top bunk) for a little privacy. So we went to sleep this night everything was fine.. la ti fucking da bro.. Then I woke up in the middle of the night (I think it ended up being somewhere around 2 or 3) on my stomach at the bottom of my bed.. now the bunk was pushed up against a wall, so on one side of me was a window by my head and a window by my feet and the other side was where I would get off the bed. But anyway, I woke up at the bottom of my bed on my stomach.. Extremely disoriented because of this, I remeber I kept thinking ""This can't be right? I'm just seeing things in a second this will all clear up and make sense.."" As if I were just dead asleep and needed that dreaminess to go away, but then I realized I was staring at my sisters glow in the dark stickers she had stamped all over her closet..  Which was visible through the slats at the foot of the bed, where my head definitely shouldn't be.. On top of that I noticed an odd light outside the window it was orange/yellow and was going off then on every second or so.. Not pulsating but not flickering I could never figure out the right word for exactly how it was acting.. But this was also very odd because we had a very, very, small backyard that led directly into a forest and so I had no idea where this light could be coming from. I almost stuck my hand through the crack between  the wall and bed to peek out the curtain but I didn't and I sort of regret that but am also glad in a weird way? Anyway I suppose this was just weird enough to make me want to get up.. Before this I was fine a bit disoriented and weirded out but not scared.. Until I went to get up, I went to brush the curtains aside and my hand hit solid fucking wall.. I was again extremely confused but I tried again and more fucking wall.. I'm shaking so bad just typing this.. I started to panic at this point and crying. Alot. I was moving all up and down my bed trying to get out.. Freaking out.. I was pushing and pushing trying to move whatever fucking thing it was a wall? Or something? Eventually I noticed that it was not in fact covering the entire front of my bed at the very edges it was lighter at the very edges I could stick my finger out.. But that also confirmed to me that yes, there was something there and yes, I was trapped. At this point I had stopped crying so much and saw something else out of the top slats the ones by my head.. A shape bigger than anything we had leaning up against the wall.. And I remember thinking it was a wall for B's bed.. 

Now I finally had the bright idea to wake her up.. So I tried reaching up through the area by the wall to tap her awake and calling her name and asking her to turn on the light.. Then K said from the other side of the room ""I'll do it"" and I'll never forget the way she said it.. Monotone and not asleep at all.. Not like a person being woken up but someone who had been awake I don't know if she had but it bothered and stuck with me.. Anyway I moved back over to the wall behind the curtains and had my hand on it when she turned on the lights.. The room flipped it like rotated I'll never forget that feeling either like the whole world just righted itself or something.. My hands instantly sank into the blinds on the other side where the window was and I was able to get out of my bed.. I had been completely awake at this point not really crying anymore and no longer disoriented just horrified.. It made me pretty angry.. The room flipping itself it was like it was pretending it didn't happen or something maybe it makes no sense to anyone else and maybe being angry at it is silly but I was and still kind of am.. That was one of the most horrifying things I've ever experienced and it was just like ""oopsie daisy let me just turn this and ah all back to normal!"" I have no idea what it was that happened I know it wasn't sleep paralysis as I have that and know what it does and how it makes me feel and how to snap myself out of it. 

But yeah that's one of the scary things I've been through.maybe no one will believe me a lot of people don't or maybe someone might be able to help me figure out what the fuck happened to me.. I was rather traumitzed after this and didn't sleep in the dark until I was 21 or so.. A lot of weird things have happened to me in my life but nothing like this before or since

TL:DR I got trapped in my bed when I was 14 it was one of the most confusing and terrifying things I've ever experienced"
"I guess this is turning into a lot of home invasion stories. I started dating a coworker that had separated from an abusive husband about a half year prior. Hed lock her in a room, wouldn't let her have friends - I found out she never went to lunch at work because she was afraid he'd show up and see her just near another male. 

Turned out he was still harassing and stalking her. Eventually went through her phone records and found my number, and email address, sent a bunch of weird threatening messages, threatened her that she'd show up at my place with a gun. I didn't respond, because y'know, what do you say.

One night hanging out with her at my place, immediately after sleeping together, there was a knock at the door and it was the dude. I'd never seen him before so I didn't realize who it was until he started telling about talking to (girl's name). I tried to shut the door, wouldn't let me shut it, I swung it open and beat him up. He ran off banging on neighbors doors (apartment) yelling that he's being attacked. Property manager came out, we tried to make him leave, crazy dude calls 911 and says he's being assaulted.

Cops show up (again, my apartment), I tell them what happened, they arrest him. His parents pay for an expensive lawyer and he gets away scott free. Me and the girl got restraining orders at least, and he never bothered her or me again. But it traumatized her and she had a lot of problems leaving her apartment or being intimate. Eventually ended because she couldn't feel comfortable around me or anywhere but alone in her apartment. Loved her a lot. Really sad."
"So I used to go to a private Catholic school, and we had a pretty small playground. Right outside the playground was a really big neighborhood, and people passed by all the time. When I was in third grade there was this one guy that would always show up at about my recess time. He always carried a camera... one day I was with my group of friends, and I look over and see that his camera is pointed right at us... I tell my friends, and we all talk about it, but do nothing. After a while he isn't going away. I run over to the supervisor and tell her. Then about eight minutes later the cops show up, and he tries to run, but they catch him. We were later told that he was a bad man taking pictures of us..."
"This didn't happen to me but it did to my sister. Me and her were fighting over something stupid and she says ""I'm going to run away"" and I say ""Fine I don't care"" and I unlock the front door for her (Yes very irresponsible but I was very young at the time) and she goes outside. It has been fifteen minutes and she didn't come back. Then, the busts open the front door and say ""I stepped on a thorn and I saw a scary thing in the woods"". And I was like okay come here, and I took out the thorn and she told me what happened. She said (I don't remember word for word) ""I was walking to the woods and I looked down the hill and saw a scary human with long long hair"". Now, I'm 16 almost 17 now and I'm not sure if she was making it up or not. But good gosh I remember the look on her face as clear as day and I'm sure she wasn't joking..."
"I woke up early maybe in grade 5 early one time before school started. 

I had tomogachis (those little pet animals) I was playing on them but heard a random bang on my door like wind would hit a door.

It was winter so no windows were open. My papa had died a couple months before this and I thought it was my mom so I yelled “Mom?”

No answer. I then thought it was my papa and started talking about my tomogachis to him and what they do. 

I heard my mom coming and said to papa”It’s time to go papa.” The same sound hit the door.  

It freaked me out and nothing like that has ever happened to this day. I’m 23 years old now."
"I know it wasn't, but it sure felt like it. I had a visitation from my grandfather a couples years after he died. 

I was working in a pizza shop attached to a grocery store when he came it.  He was dressed like my grandfather, and sounded like him. I can't remember what he looked like. I don't think I looked at him too often. I was gripping the counter to try and stay upright. The room was swirling, I've never felt like that before or since.  I was having trouble functioning so the other girl took his order and I went to ring him up. He said things to me you don't say to a complete stranger.  Things about going forward in life. It was 40 years ago now and I don't remember specifically. When he went to pay, he took one of those plastic change purses out that you squeeze the ends together, like my grandfather always carried. So many coincidences, it freaked me out."
"I was working extremely late at a summer job in Anchorage. I got out of there after 2 AM. Obviously it was still bright outside. I wasn't terribly worried about my safety at first, since my place was a short walk down the road. But then I noticed three other young people walking behind me. They just gave me a really bad feeling. And seemed to be picking up their pace to get closer to me. I don't know if they were drunk or criminals or something else, but I realized ""I am fucked if I don't get away from them. They could gang up on me at any second. There's nobody around to help me. Hustle the fuck out of here now!"" Never tried something so stupid & dangerous again."
"So when my mom was driving home from a store the window next to me was open all the way. It took like 7 minutes to get home. The window was still open and I put my head out to take a nice look of my neighborhood. Then, what I saw below me was the window closing. I screamed very loud because I was very scared and thought I was going to die. My parents heard and opened the window. My heart was beating so fast of fear, man I am never doing this again."
"I was hanging out with my friends and we were casually chilling in my basement playing the sims because we are losers.  We were chugging Dr. Pepper like our lives depended on it when we ran out.  My friend Jessica said she was gonna go get more and while she went I went to the bathroom.  When I came out of the bathroom I was gonna go upstairs with her but realized she was still walking up the steps so went back to the couch to sit down.  When I got to the couch JESSICA WAS STILL ON THE COUCH!!!!!! I swear I watched her walk up the stairs I know I did, let’s just say when my other friend came back in the room he got greeted by us throwing salt at him and touching him with tiny iron pig statues to assure that he wasn’t a hecking alien."
When walking out to my truck late at night (I'm a dude) and some random person walks up behind me and tries to take my keys from me resulting in me hitting them with a tire iron. Or when this customer waited out in the parking lot after closing time and slowly drove past me late at night while I was getting in my vehicle. There are so many super creepy things that I've experienced it's hard to pick just one.
we were biking to nature park minalungoa and we saw this small cottage up a mountain so as dumb teenagers we went to it it looks run down but the creepiest part was we saw raggidy doll weird closet it when my friends tried to grab it he was pricked because there were needles prick to it so we taught it a witch and we were standing on a witch cottage so hell no we left that cottage as fast as lightning

"sleeping in my bed minding my own business and then a pink toy dog meant for preschoolers suddenly said ""LET'S PLAY!"" very loudly while it's distorted toy music started playing. you best believe that i jumped out of the bed and got a hold of that doll. it was in the morning hours so it was around the time I was supposed to be waking up, but I have a habit of sleeping late. I got the doll and ripped open its back to turn it off. a family that came to look at my house when we were selling it, might have had a little girl that brought the raggedy toy with her and left it behind. I still had it for months before I dumped that possessed thing in the garbage. it was old and filthy and sat on one of the lower shelves near the foot of my bed. I still don't know how it managed to sound off like that because since it had taken residence in my room I had very rarely touched it. one of the worst wake up calls of my life."

"I did a oujia board with my friend, and she never said goodbye... To Zozo.... Apperently, zozo's brother was trying to kill her so that the ""gateway"" wouldn't close and he could kill more people. Zozo turned out to be really nice and would take blame for his brother's crimes.

Also, I had a cat die two years before we did the ouiji board, and it turns out my cat is my guardian angel."
"Looking at some watches when a lady randomly starts talking to me, this was very out of the blue but I brushed it off as her being just a friendly middle aged woman. 

Proceeded to continue shopping in multiple stores. She was there. In every single one. We exchanged some more conversation including where she pointed out this store we were in had good offers on t-shirts. 

I turned to my partner who was with me and said to him that would be good for him. She commented something along the lines of this wasn't about him. The conversation comes to a close there and my partner and I continue to peruse a bit more around this area of the store.

This lady then comes back to this area where she then grabs my wrist with two fingers to move me. No exchange of words. She's just touching me. There was no need for this, there was plenty of room.

Granted probably not creepy by most people's standards but I still get shivers thinking about how disgusting it felt to have this stranger grab me"
"I had a camping trip for school, and we stayed in a cabin. On the second night, I was awake, reading, and everyone else was asleep. The bed I was sleeping in had a clear view of the window out the door, so I could see the path that led up the hill to our cabin. The whole camp are was originally owned by a lumberjack in the 1800s, and all the staff had reportedly heard and seen the lumberjack at night, walking around. When I was just about asleep, I looked out the window and saw a man walking up the path and into the woods, I couldn’t see his face, but it looked like he was holding a axe. I don’t really believe in ghosts, and just thought it was my teacher prank if us, like he was know to do. But then, someone got up to go to the bathroom, and turned on a light. It shone out the windows and the dude was gone. He just vanished into thin air. I don’t really believe in ghosts, but that was terrifying."
"Near my house is an abandoned retirement home, it was abandoned somewhere between 2006 - 2009. My friends and I went inside sometimes, which was pretty easy but not as amusing. There was a small broken window between the stairs of the entrance but that window led to a room underneath the main level. For some reason there was a ladder so that we could go down the window safely. The house itself was already creepy but I was used to it by how often I went inside there. In the middle of the retirement home was a yard, which led to a different part of the building. It also had a chapel in there and inside of the chapel was a blanket with red liquid on it. My friends knew it wasn't real blood since it was still red. A few levels higher was a room right next to the stairs with a bathtub and a jesus statue right next to it. I never saw it since I got warned by my friends. One of the halls there was filled with pigeons and we had no ides how they came inside since every window was closed.

One day we decided to explore the other psrt of the building and we found a morgue cooler and a suspicious looking wall. My friend tried to kick it but nothing happened so we moved on to the next level of the building. In ond of those rooms was a shelf and a door which led to the hallway. The other part was a bit stifling, so I opened one of the windows. I looked around but couldn't really see anything since we went there always at night. A friend of mine also leaned out of the window and we just talked about school stuff until I was mainly focused on the main entrance of the building. It had two see through door, just enough room in the middle of them and I saw something standing there but I remained calm since it was probably nothing. I noticed that my friend didn't say anything for a few seconds but just leaned back into the room and I asked her what she had. She was also pretty calm and unsure of what she saw but she pointed at the entrance and asked me if I see the figure standing there. At that point I knew that something wasn't right but I still remained calm because I don't want to overreact since we had a friend, who could have a panick attack any given moment. I got another friend of mine and asked him to focus on the entrance and if he's seeing someone there. He was the one who assumed that every living thing was the police so he got all our friends and said that the police was there but I knew that it wasn't the police since it stood right between those doors. They were automatic and a fence protect the entrance from anyone who tried to enter it from the outside AND inside. Before we started to run the rest also checked up at the entrance before we overreact for nothing but they saw it too. We ran out of the second part of the building and ran to the room where we came from. It took us a long time to get there and when I was close to the entrance I still saw the figure standing in there. My friend first had to check if anyone was outside of the building (cops or the security guard). Once it was safe we all got out and we saw that there was no police car. I immediately turned on my phone flashlight to see if something was inside the entrance that could've tricked our eyes but there was nothing.

After that I always checked up if nothing is between those doors but after the incident with the police, they put a wooden panel on everything they could."

"Lots of weird and creepy stuff has happened to me but most of it I only realized was creepy after it happened. I can think of one however. This happened when I was 10ish. Let me give you some background. I lived in a very haunted house in a pretty haunted neighborhood(my friends houses were also haunted) We lived on a street that backed a large golf course. I’m not talking like a putting rang and a little golf shop area though, that was farther out. We were by a big patch of green with some sand pits and a decent amount of holes. It was not an area you saw to many golfers in however. The houses were on a hill though so to get to the golf course you had to walk a few houses down to enter a path that took you all the way down the hill and to the course. Ok now to the story. So I was with a friend and we were partners in a game of night hide and go seek. Pretty much a group of our neighborhood friends and us would play this game at night sometimes. So there were groups of two and three and after the “it” people started counting we made a b line for the golf course right behind my house because it was “out of bounds” and we were always coughs first so we were trying to wait till we were the last ones and then go back up the path to my house and hide in some trees or something so people wouldn’t know we had cheated. So after we had gone down the path we ran across the green all the way to a big oak tree on at the bottom of the other hill across from the hill my house was on. We just kinda waited there talking and running around because we were filled with adrenaline. Eventually we saw the silhouette of a man waking a great distance away. We didn’t really think anything of it because we were used to seeing people jogging or walking at night. But soon he got closer and we both got an uneasy feeling so we decided to head back to the path and go find our friends. As we started walking he increased his speed and we started to suspect he was following us. We were a quarter of a way up the hill (it really wasn’t that long) and he was about 20 yards from the start. We kinda started jogging and he fucking started speed walking. We then began full out sprinting and made it to the top and ran back to our friends who had found a couple people already. I can’t remember if we told them or not but I don’t think we did. In conclusion, we can’t ever be 100% sure that he was following us. We were young with over active imaginations and it was late and dark. I just think he probably was because we were young kids alone on a big green and it would’ve been easy to kidnap us, however he could have just been jogging I really don’t like jumping to conclusions. I just think the worst part of this is that if we had been kid napped, the green is one of the last places our friends would’ve looked for us because it was “out of bounds”...

Ps. Before you say my parents were irresponsibly For letting their 10-year-old go out unsupervised at night, first of all I was with my older brother, all of our friends were older like mid to late teens, and the places that were in bounds were completely safe. We were just stupid."

"My brother was a sleepwalker and always talked in his sleep. Our house was built in the 90's...1890's...he woke me up having a fit one night, which sounded like a terrible dream that went on for about thirty seconds...I finally yelled from my room for him to knock it off and go to sleep and it stopped instantly...methinks to my myself, holy shit it worked...a few seconds later I hear my old ass door creek open and slow footsteps come across my old wooden floor to the foot of my bed...I squeaked out my brother's name, to which there was no answer...immediately I hid under my covers and nearly shit myself...still get goosebumps thinking about that night..."
Was around 5-6 years old. Was on a long road trip   to a diffrent province. It was getting dark out so we went to a hotel to stay in. We had to take the elevator to our room. I got on the elevator first and before my mom could get on the door closed. I remember clearly as the elevator moved without opening its doors. The doors finally opened on floor with pink walls. Nobody was at the doors (i never stepped off). The elevator then closed its doors and opened at the goring level where my mom was with a hotel staff member. When I told the staff member about the pink floor he was confused. He said that there isnt a pink floor in the hotel. Scared the shit out off me at the time.
I was around 6. I had a nightmare and woke up. I hallucinated the floor was heads ready to eat me. Then I heard a laugh. Look in the dark corner and saw nothing. Felt watched while typing this.

"Sleep paralysis. I fucked my sleep up so bad when I was in college. 

On the flip side, though, I don’t do those drugs anymore *and* I can now control my actions when I dream, so that’s good. (If I can do that, that probably means I’m not getting true restful sleep or something, but ah well. )"
"Was at my cousins house,home alone , dog starts barking at the door but it only does that when someones at the door. We check it out, no ones there. We go outside too look and see the upstairs light on, we go up too see who was in there.  The doors is locked. 

Apparently his parent lock the door too the only room upstairs since the stairs go right into the room, and the light was from the stairs lights being on and the window at the stairs showed the light"
I had just woken up from a short name to a message from the app Sing! by Smule saying “Hi (op’s) name. This person knew my real name which no one but 3 people knew who I was extremely close too. I asked “Who are you how do you know my name?” But I never got a reply. Worse thing is they had followed my 2 close friends who did have my name.
"Being stalked at night on ultiple ocations by car or men.

One 2 men stalked me in a gym that was open 24/7 and we were alone. Had to call my fiancé and he ordered me not to stop talking to him. Think I pissed them off due they left me alone then."

"My first case of sleep paralysis comes to mind. I woke up in the first light of dawn to the emaciated corpse of a holocaust victim on top of me in a crawling position with its hands either side of my head. Most fucked up thing was it wasn’t looking at me, it’s head was turned looking at my bedroom door, frozen, skin vacuum packed to its bones, wispy Gollum hair. Well my core muscles around my waist were somehow not paralysed so I thrashed like a fucking caterpillar at a rave and beat the shit out of the back of my head against the wall in the process."

I was home alone with my sister because my parents were still at work. I looked over at my sister then out of nowhere I heard a voice say “Kill her.” Then I got this feeling that I wanted to see her bleed. That fricked me up.
"I had dreamt of a freak car accident at a local intersection; it was a vivid dream of which I was able to remember an awful lot of, I never remember any of my dreams. I was looking down from a birds-eye-view of the accident. It was a black Cadillac Escalade that ran a red light and crashed into a white Toyota Camry and caused a shit ton of other cars to collide with them, then a 60ish year old man emerging out of the Camry sunroof and walking away looking unscathed. I woke up that morning and thought nothing of it, it crossed my mind a couple of times but I never really looked into it. Later that day my friend and I were walking to the football (soccer) pitch. I had told him about it and my friend just laughed it off. We had to cross the intersection to get to the pitch. My friend stopped and sarcastically said, ""DoN't CrOsS, YoU'rE gOnnA GeT hIT."" and sure enough about 5 seconds later a black Escalade seemed to just spawn in and T-boned a White Camry that was crossing the intersection. My friend and I were dead silent for the rest of the walk to the pitch. The only detail that I wasn't able to see was the man emerging for the Camry but I'm 100% sure if we had waited it would've happened. That was the first and only time something like that had happened, my friend and I still have no explanation for that. I've never been any good at predictions either."
"Honestly, when men grab me is the creepiest shit ever.  The first time I was 12, the last time it happened is last year.  I am in my 50s now and I am still dealing with these creepy as fuck people. It happed 8 months ago and I am still jumpy and pissed off as hell."
"Some creature kept calling me and sounded like my mom. It stood outside my door. 

I soon realized that it wasn't my mom. So I asked ""who is it""?

Big mistake. It started screaming and shaking and banging on my door and screeching. White lights shined from beneath and above the door.


My parents came in a panic (their door is next to mine), and the minute they opened their door it faded away. They knocked as asked me why was I banging on the door. I said I didn't. They searched the house for intruders. Nothing. 

I searched it up. Apparently it was an angel who goes around killing people. 

So that's how I almost died."
"I don't know why, but it seems as if I had recently experienced  an Astral Projection, still gathering information as it is the fist time has happened to me."

When I looked in the mirror
"I really don't want this to end up in some ""fun, good, and totally creative"" YouTube video among the sea of people that make the versions of lazy r/AskReddit videos with text to speech voices, but here it goes.

I'll place this event as it happened around 2013 to 2015. It was sometime after I had completed high school and had recently started talking to a friend of mine that I had in high school once again. At this point he had moved into an apartment and I had been invited to stay over where he and other friends would also hang out as well as catch up. I figured there was no harm in this and said, ""Sure.""

He had a couple of friends over that afternoon, who I'm pretty sure he might have met through an open door policy type of thing that he had going on in his apartment or something along those lines, as he had a habit of making friends with all sorts of people and people off the street as well. But I remember one of them asking if they could get a knife from him that they had asked him to ""hold on to"", which I found really strange and off-putting.

I have to admit, that really creeped me out. 

Anyway, skipping to nightfall, when I'm preparing to go to bed. I hear knocking on the sliding glass door window of his apartment at first and see some sort of human shadow that was knocking on it and attempting to peer in. I have no idea if it was one of the friends he had invited over earlier, or someone else completely that I didn't know.

To me, it didn't matter. Then they came to the front door and knocked on it as well, even trying the doorknob as if they were attempting to enter the apartment. At this point I was thoroughly creeped out and scared more than I ever had been in my entire life up until that point. 

I want to go back to the point I made for a moment before about the two friends, we're even at that moment I didn't feel safe it is apartment with them there, and I felt exactly the same way with the knocking situation going on that night. 

So, because I felt his mother had a better understanding of the whole situation then either of my parents did, I gave her a call and explained to her what was going on. I asked her if she could come by and pick me up, where she agreed to do so.

She comes over, where quite a seething argument happens between her and my friend (her son), to the point that there's yelling outside of his apartment because of this. I'm not sure if it had to do with the fact that I didn't say anything to him about the situation and she just used spare keys to get into his apartment or something along those lines. The point is I didn't feel safe, I packed my bags, and she drove me home. 

I owe my friend's mother a lot for helping me in a very stressful situation that I didn't feel safe in."
"When I was at an age where I can remember, but too young to remember any details that would prove my story is true I had just moved into a mansion with my family. Before us, it was named ""Spooky Hauntington"" and there were *rumors* that it was haunted. 

**One night** I was lying in bed when suddenly I heard footsteps outside my room. I pulled the covers over my head. I heard my door open and my heart was pounding. **Then**, suddenly, I heard a ghost speak to me in my mother's voice (MY MOTHER ENDED UP DYING 30 YEARS AFTER THIS HAPPENED. COINCIDENCE? YES.) ""Adam, sweetheart, go to bed. I love you"". I proceeded to wet my bed. 

TLDR: I was sexually assaulted by a ghost."

"Me(17), my dad, and my step mom were at the very top of a 2.3 mile hike with a 750 foot high escalation. There were two trails to get to the top, one being steeper and shorter, and the other being longer and more flat. We took the steep short trail coming up and decided we were too tired to do all of the climbing down and tried to find the other path. We eventually got lost looking for it (the end of the trail was a mountain top with plenty of open area to explore). Went spent 30 minutes looking for this trail when we hear someone running up on us. I turn to see some guy dressed in a park ranger uniform running towards us behind some trees. Immediately we are all startled and are all alert. ""You guys lost?"" said the ""park ranger"". His uniform looked unofficial and he looked like Ted Bundy, all the more reason to be terrified. Even his personality was very unsettling.

He showed us a map, but not in a way a normal person would, he spread it out on the ground and pointed to where we were and suggested that we all be very close to the map while he showed us. The map did not help at all, this map did not show where the trails are, it shows roads. After about 5 minutes of nonsensical conversation with the guy he says. ""You know what, I'll be right back and I'll show you where the trail starts. He runs off in the direction he came from. While the guy is off doing whatever my dad states that park ranger uniforms could be purchased and you didn't need to be one to look like one. The guy runs back with a bag. 

Now this is where we are all terrified. In his bag is the largest knife I had ever seen, it was just hanging out of the side of the bag. We followed him to the trail and he kept his distance ahead of us, which just crept us out even more. Then, out of nowhere, he stops and drops his bag and starts rummaging through it. At this point all three of us are looking at each other and talking about how creeped out we are. He runs back with the map and lays it down on the ground in front of us and suggests that we all take a picture of it. We follow along and take a picture of the area on the map where we are. We say thank you but he suggests my dad take a closer picture of the map. My dad compiles and takes a closer picture. The guy takes up his map and continues down the trail. For the rest of the 2.3 miles down we are all very alert and looking out for anywhere that guy could be hiding but luckily we never saw him again.

The guy gave off total serial killer vibes and I will never forget how creepy that guy was.

TLDR: Got lost on a long hiking trip and encountered a very creepy ""park ranger"""

Oh my god this is creepy as fuck I can visualise this so clearly and I would have shit myself exactly the same in your situation.
He shouted at the guy to try to gauge his intentions.. I'm guessing he didn't answer because he's a horse.
Holy fuck that is so cool. I can't imagine the relief.
This was not the outcome I was expecting!
That's just what the horse wants you to think.
"I can remember when I was a teen-ager I had to go down a country lane in the dark to fetch our horses in from a field. There was a story about the ghost of a grey lady being seen on this lane. I always thought about this and I always used to run back up as fast as I could. One really bright moonlit night I got to the field and saw a shape under the hedge that, to me, looked like a woman wearing a big billowing skirt. I froze for what seemed like ages and all I could hear was blood pumping in my head. I was thinking ""I'm actually seeing a ghost"". Then the ghost called to me ""opopkl, is that you?"". It was actually a friend I knew. He was down there with his girlfriend doing something (?). He was wearing a dark shirt, she was wearing a light one, but they both had stonewashed jeans on which together looked like a voluminous skirt."
"I laughed so goddamn hard, thank you"
Goddamn skinwalkers.
"People carry torches, not lanterns or flashlights  at night where you’re from ? That’s creepy enough for me"
"in the moment that must have been the most terrefying thing ever, but now way later you must feel so stupid fearing a horse that with his outline looked like a man walking towards you."
"Driving one time with friends, they were all talking but I mentally froze, looking ahead in horror at the creature staring out at us from a blind curve. It was grotesque. It was incredibly skinny and unhealthily frail. It stood gaunt on two knobby legs, I could see it's collar dip deep on this curving unnatural frame. It hobbled toward the woods on one shaky step and it's two bulbous eyes shone in the headlights. It was evil, the thin high arched face staring at us, blankly. Then it turned and I realized it was just a dopey deer facing us perfectly head on. It chewed once and hopped away."
"Had a very similar experience but with a cow. My friends and I were looking for a ""haunted"" stone cross in the middle of the night and saw what looked like a man dragging something and we lost our minds. One friend was brave enough to get closer and realized it was just a cow grazing."

I'm sorry you say you don't have flashlights and then proceeded to say you find it creepy that someone else isn't walking with flashlight....

This deserves gold. *trots away*
Might be a stupid question...but do wild horses still exist?
Ugh I live in a horse town ... so many times I’ll be driving down my street and think there’s a 12 foot tall person walking down the road and it’s actually just someone on horseback !
"I’ve read this story before on reddit, have you posted it?"
"A few weeks ago I was walking my dog on a short trail in the woods near my house at night. I heard some leaves rustle behind me which was normal because there's always small animals out there. Then I realized they were footsteps, then I realized it was running, then I realized it was charging toward me. That was one of the most terrifying moments of my life, going from a peaceful walk through the woods to having god-knows-what charging at me in the dark. It turned out to be the neighbor's German shepherd coming to say hi to my dog. The fear only lasted for a second, but my whole body was tingling for 30 minutes after."
I want to live in a world where random greyhounds show up in my house!

"I have had the same experience. I got up and chased him out. Luckily his prints where already on file from a petty crime previously. When they hauled him in he confessed that he was checking I was asleep before he set my house on fire. 
Completely random attack. It's been 16 years and luckily it didn't mess me up probably due to how quickly the police acted but I didn't sleep for a few weeks after that. 
Hope you are ok."
holy shit you are so lucky
Oh my god
Wow... that is terrifying
It's super creepy how many of us have this same story.
I had a very similar experience. The light turned on in my room when I was sleeping and a man was standing there. I was very fortunate that my dog chased him out of the house. It gives you an unsettling feeling the rest of your life.
"I was awake at like 4am once, and I heard my doorknob jiggling. Someone was going around my apartment complex checking locks (I found out later from my landlord), and I absolutely lost my shit. I turned off the tv, hid under a blanket, and just waited for it to stop. It was only like a few seconds, but it felt like forever. I didn't even look out the peephole to make sure they were gone because I couldn't handle seeing them. I couldn't even imagine being face to face with an intruder."
"Oh my, glad you made it out safe."

"When I read that you ran to your parents room and saw your dad sleeping there, my heart skipped a beat. I have a similar story of sleep paralysis at a young age. I was probably like 8. I woke up to see somebody’s body in my bed staring at me with a slit in his throat dripping blood. I was on the top bunk, and had to make it to the opposite end to the ladder without waking the guy up (I didn’t realize that he was dead, now that I look back on it, he was). I ran to my parents room and got my dad, who looked through the apartment, which was pretty small. Nobody was in my bed, no blood on my sheets, all the doors and windows locked, and nobody in the house. I didn’t sleep for a week. Scarred me for a little while."

"Jesus, this is the scariest one here."
"I get those hallucinations about twice a week. I can never remember what they’re called though. It’s so scary and when I try to explain it to anyone, they just think I’m crazy. My husband, however, has caught me literally screaming for him and talking in my sleep because of these hallucinations. He still thinks I’m crazy."
"Sleep  paralysis  is you  hallucinationing or hear things while you can't move or speek. That couldn't of been it as you said you turned. In sleep paralysis  the brain is awake but the body isn't, so you can't move.

That's something else, I'm sure of it."
"I get them all the time too, even though they’re so realistic I’ve just learned to disregard them and continue to drift into sleep. Have you ever had a sleep study done?"
jesus i don't even know what a plank position is but fuck this post entirely
Worst sleep paralysis story I've ever read.
"This is absolutely the most terrifying thing that I've ever read. This is so far above everything else, no comparison to be had. Jesus. This is gonna stick with me for life. Damn."
">hypnagogic auditory hallucinations

This is actually known as ""Exploding Head Syndrome"" I have it too and it sucks.

 [https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/exploding-head-syndrome#1](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/exploding-head-syndrome#1)"
"Wow! Crazy how our bodies can support us through traumatic events. So glad you’re ok.

Did the cops ever arrest him?"
"I completely know that out of body feeling. I was held up at gun point and one of the guys pointed and demanded I walk to the bedroom. I mentally detached at that point. We all stood there for a second. He looked at the main dude and main dude shook his head no. It's like you can't even process what just happened enough to react to it, so you just keeping acting normal"
"oh my god, as a female who lives alone in NYC this is one of my worst fears. Cheers to you for being a strong badass, and I am so so glad you’re okay."
"If you don’t mind me asking, how did you talk him out of it (rape)? Also, how did he get your number?"
That out of body feeling is called disassociation. It’s a defense mechanism. It’s a way to not be entirely present for what you’re going through.
"I'm glad you're okay, damn."
"Wow, that's insane. How did his energy change? How could you tell he was considering assaulting you? 

I'm just curious. Intuition is an interesting thing to me."
okay I will start locking my patio door
"You just described astral-flight, a type of out-of-body experience caused by your brain going into overdrive, similarly to near-death flashbacks in which it tries to find solutions from past experiences at a rapid speed to prevent your death."
That gave me serious anxiety...
"Speaking of creepy toys, this reminds me of the time I was staying over at my friend's grandparent's house. My friend's four-year-old niece had just had her birthday party there, and there were presents still scattered around the living room.

Well, we all forgot about the motion-activated laughing baby doll that got stashed behind the couch because it was annoying. This was funny when we did it. It was not funny when I got up in the middle of the night for some water, stumbled just enough to jostle the doll out of place, and heard a sudden *clunk* followed by disembodied children's laughter. I have never jumped so high nor sworn so loudly in my life."
"I had a toy soft monkey that one night I left on my cabinet facing me while I slept.
I ended up just staring at it feeling uncomfortable for a long time and eventually started seeing its head turn.
I think if I believed it would happen to enough my mind just hallucinate seeing it."
"Aww. I didn’t experience sleep paralysis until I was like 19, and it was terrible. I’m sorry you experienced that as a young child. I hope you’ve been able to outgrow it."
"Oh shit...this just reminded me of an old similar story. My mom gave my sister and I this porcelain doll that sat on her knees in a praying position with her eyes shut in prayer. She had a little gold cross necklace wrapped around her hands and we would gently touch her before bed every night as a sort of ritual for safe dreams.

The opposite ended up happening, 'cause both my sister and I started to get REALLY creeped out by this doll. We both had frequent dreams of her eyes *opening* and watching us in the low light before we fell asleep. Sometimes the necklace in her hands would sway like she was moving.

I realize now that this was most likely a shared sleep paralysis thing since we had discussed it with each other and probably induced the memory in each other's minds. At the time, though, it freaked us both out a lot considerably.

Mom still has the doll packed away in a box somewhere, and last time I saw it, I didn't feel the slightest discomfort around it. It just feels like a doll to me now. The memory of that short amount of time it stayed in our room, though....That shit stuck with me."
"Naranja dulce,

Dame un abrazo,

"For sleep paralysis, a toy giraffe moving it’s neck by itself is pretty tame. Not trying to undermine your experience, as I know how fucking creepy that type of thing is, but I was not in your shoes so I’m not one to say much anyway"
Wait there's a bakugan game for xbox
"Posted this a while ago in another thread, but it fits here. I had a similar ghost experience in my parents' new house, thought you might want to hear about it. 

My parents bought a new house the summer I graduated high school. The previous occupant was an old lady, so we helped her get ready to move out after the sale was finalized. As she was packing photos of her husband (who was long deceased), she wondered out loud if he would move with her - turns out she totally thought his ghost was living in the house, and would close doors or walk around at night. It was freaky, but I chalked it up to her missing her husband and maybe being a bit senile.

​

The next time I came home was for winter break. I stayed up pretty late gaming, and right as I was falling asleep, I very clearly heard footsteps creaking down the hallway floor to the bedrooms. I called out, thinking I had missed one of my parents getting up, but all I could hear was the air blowing through the heating vents. Then I remembered - my dad had warned me about the new security system, which had motion sensors across that hallway. Anyone walking around at night would trigger the alarm. Just as I was starting to calm down, my open bedroom door slammed shut. Freaking out a little, I stayed up for about an hour, but nothing else happened and I did my best to fall asleep. It was hard, though, and I woke up a few times, convinced I heard a voice in the hallway, only for it to go away when I actually lifted my head to listen. I asked my parents if they heard anything the next morning, but they hadn't, and I didn't want to go into detail because I knew they would make fun of me for having an overactive imagination.

​

I heard the footsteps again the next night, and again for several nights during that vacation. The door to my room would slam shut if left open, and rattle sometimes even if kept closed. I'd hear the voice sometimes, too. This repeated itself when I was home for spring break. I was actually a bit apprehensive about going home for summer vacation, but I didn't hear anything unusual for those two months, even when my parents left me to house-sit for a week alone. I got into the habit of sleeping with my bedroom door open again, and figured if there was a ghost, he'd realized we weren't his family and moved on.

​

Christmas rolls around again, and my first night home, the same sequence repeats itself - footsteps followed by the slamming door. A few days later, I hear the whispering voice in the hallway right as I'm falling asleep. Of course, it disappears the second I become fully alert. At this point, I'm convinced the house is haunted, and babble about it to my parents over breakfast. They, of course, dismiss it is me being ""nervous"" and turning little sounds made by a very old building into something scary because I'm too impressionable. I left it at that, but I absolutely refused to stay in that house alone for several years. I kept hearing the same haunting sounds, but only very late at night, and never in the summer.

​

A few years ago, again around Christmas, I was reading a reddit thread about hauntings, when I read a comment about how white noise, such as from fans or AC, can sometimes be interpreted by the brain as voices or music. There it was, the common denominator for all the phenomena in my parents' ""haunted"" house: the heating system. I realized the sequence of events was always the same - I always heard the ""footsteps"" creak along the floor right as the heat turned on, and the door would always slam or rattle soon after that. The ""whispering voice"" also only made itself known if hot air was blowing through the vents. None of this happened during warmer months, when the heating system was off. The next week, my parents were out of town again, and I decided to run an experiment. I kept the heat off every night, only turning it on during the day. Lo and behold - no haunting! No odd events for the first winter since we got the house! So basically, my parents were right, and I was panicking over wooden beams creaking as they warmed, and the ridiculously strong airflow from the vents moving my door and making me hear things.

​

I almost feel bad for the old lady we bought the house from. She probably didn't hear any similar noises in her new place, and thought her husband's ""ghost"" had been left behind. It sounded like she liked having him around - I hope she wasn't lonelier without him!

​

tl;dr: Previous homeowner made me think my parents' new house was haunted, but only on cold nights. Years later realized it was the heating system causing the very old house to make noise. Felt dumb I was scared for so long."
Maybe you had a fever and it caused some hallucinations? It happened to me when I was about the same age
"This reminded me of a similarly eery thing that happened to me when I was still a young teen. I also don't really believe in ghosts. This happened late on a Sunday night and I knew it was late because Walker Texas Ranger that was normally on after the 20h00 o'clock movie had already finished. I was sitting alone on our lounge floor building a puzzle completely engaged in the activity, then I heard footsteps but it sounded like someone wearing slippers who was dragging their feet a bit. I was facing away from the door and the sound came from the door and ended right behind me as if someone had walked up to me. I then felt cold, not sure if it was just a reaction from my body from being spooked. I was absolutely petrified I didn't know what to do so I calmly stood up and walked to my bedroom as if nothing had happened, to be petrified is such a weird feeling you want to scream and shout yet something is preventing you from reacting and the only thing is to act absolutely normal. We had two large dogs and I climbed in bed and got them to lay with me and stayed awake until I eventually passed out I feel so fortunate that to have the beloved dogs around they helped me to have no fear. I know what I heard but can't find any rational reason what it was or could of been.

The house had always given me the spooks, like if I got up to pee at night as soon as my toes touched the ground the deepfreeze would switch on and it was an older and loud model, or as soon as I touched a doorhandle to open a door, the TV would make a big clicking sound which was loud enough to be heard from where I was, many strange things like that would happen and it really seemed way to precise to be coincidence. Also I would some nights get this weird feeling on different parts of my body, it felt like someone rubbing a feather against your skin but ten times softer, or even blowing super lightly is another way I could describe this. I could even feel this happening underneath my blankets. I used to think whatever it was also had the power to control dreams as every now and then I would have weird dreams were unusual items from my early childhood would be involved (old wooden toys etc.) like moving on their own and rattling above cupboards and as soon as I would wake up from these dreams bang the deepfreeze would click on. This bothered me for years, until one day I decided to make a game out of it, I thought ohkay watch as soon as I step on the floor from my bed x is going to happen then it did, and so I would predict things happening based on how they usually would happen and shortly after doing this all the ""shenanigans"" stopped. I had actually forgotten about this and your story reminded me of it happening. Still have no idea of what it could of been but it was crazy shit indeed."
"When I read that it got to the top of the stairs I imagined the Clown from ""It"" staring at you and that makes it even scarier"
">My dad said that it was the old wooden steps creaking

At least there's a logical person in your family. Unless you're saying the police arrested, what, demons? I don't get how your HOUSE being a police station (really weird) is relevant to some supernatural ""monster""."
It was pewdiepie looking for BEANS
"So wait, was the guy always wearing the suit? With the way this reads its almost like he changed into a suit to do whatever disgusting thing he was going to do lmao"
Do you have any guesses as to why this happens?
"I had the opposite of this happen to me when I was a teenager. I would always have this running joke with my friends on a bridge we would frequent. Everytime I walked by the same light would illuminate. Everyone tried to replicate it, but it only worked when I did it. It would also happen to multiple lights around town. I used to think it was a ""guardian angel"" of sorts at the time with my multiple near death experiences and all."
"Oh, I had something similar but with Apple products. Specifically Apple, other phones and music players were absolutely fine. If I touched them or held them when they were playing music they would start fast forwarding through the song. The music would still play but it would garble and skip and the progress bar for the song would shoot along. If it wasn't playing music then the device would often freeze and then reboot.

Worked in a game shop and we would play music from the computer or phone. Boss asked me to jump through the back and skip the song that was starting on his phone as it wasn't family-friendly. Picked it up and it started glitching and sputtering. Press the skip after a moment and put it down. Music resumed half way through the next song. Came back through and he asked me if I'd managed to break his phone. I laughed and said sorry and that it was fine but I hadn't realised it was an iPhone. He was skeptical. We were in assistant manager's car the next week and the team were going for pizza. Assistant manager asked me to skip song on his phone as he was driving and manager told him not to let me touch his phone as I glitch apple products. Assistant manager laughed and said we were having him on. I picked up his phone from the centre console and it went haywire and started skipping and letting out bursts of static. He politely asked me to put his phone down and everything was fine.

I demonstrated this in uni to a lecturer and a few friends in a computer lab after they laughed and said I was winding them up. Lecturer was a bit bamboozled. I can only think that I give off a bit of static electricity (I do zap myself all the time - I close my car door with my foot as it routinely electrocutes me and no one else) and that iPhones at the time were particularly sensitive to it.

New Apple products don't seem to be a problem."
Yoooooo I have the same thing! literally last night I was eating food at Taco Bell in the parking lot and saw one of the lights go out on the side of the building and then as I was driving home not even 10 mins later I saw another street light go out as I drove past it. I’ve seen easily over 25 in the past few months. Some turn on randomly and some turn off randomly. Specific places specific lights turn off and vice Versa. Idk if it’s law of attraction or just because I’m now aware of it but I always notice it. It still get creeped out by it but I’m more scared when I see lights burn out. Lights that turn on make me feel better. I also see it as when a light turns on I feel like I’m doing a good thing and when they turn off I’m doing something negative or bad for myself. Idk it’s just how I think about it. Also I see lights that stay on in the day light too
"I've heard of this being a thing, but I can't rememver where I read about it. You're definitely not the only one."
[There’s a name for it](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_light_interference_phenomenon)
Look up street light interference syndrome
I remember hearing about a lady who couldn't be near lightbulbs because she had an electric shock as a kid and that did something to the lightbulbs
Had this happen to me a few times. It's so creepy when you're just chilling in your bed and suddendly everything turns dark. Bonus point when you then start to hear scratching in the wall besides you cuz there are mice in there
"This happens when I drive at night. Every time I drive at night, with out fail, a streetlight will go out just as I'm coming up to it. Just one, everytime."
That is awful. So sorry you had to go through that.
Shoulda been arrested for attempted murder  That's dumb and dangerous
"The feeling of drowning is awful. For my friend’s wedding party we got a double decker pontoon boat at a lake. All day we were diving off of this thing, and at the end of the day I decide to do one last back flip before we take it into the dock.

Well, the wind picked up right as I jumped and pushes the boat broadside away from me. I swim after it but the wind keeps pushing it and I eventually run out of gas from swimming all day and start to panic because somehow I lost the ability to float on my back after I went through puberty. I yell (maybe scream) for help and one of my friends quickly jumped off the boat and helped me swim back to the boat.

Sometimes I’ll remember the feeling that day, like I was going to die, and it still freaks me out."

You should have called Mystique on his ass.
Charlie kelly?
Uh..was this in Maine? I remember a creepy old dude from my childhood neighborhood that everyone called Nightcrawler for some reason..
"My daughter pulled something like this once. She was about 2 1/2 and somehow learned the word ""ghost"", no clue from where. One day she tells me there's a ""scary ghost"" in the room. I laugh and ask for more details, what does it look like etc. After a series of escalatingly creepy responses I kind of stop laughing and ask ""does the ghost talk?"" And she says, ""nope, just screams and cries."""
He could’ve just been playing a game or something. But the way you described him and his fear makes me think that something was actually up.
When my son was about 7 or 8 he was in his room watching tv. I heard him scream and ran to him. He said he saw a man in a red baseball hat just outside his window. I looked but nothing was there. We were on the first floor in a rural area. But his window was on the hill side of the house. The man would of had to either been on a ladder or about 7-8 feet tall. My son still swears to this day (15yo) that it was a real man.
"DAMNNN. Sounds like they took good care of ya'll, and then ya'll took good care of them. What a crazy story. Good on you guys for having them hop in the car for some burgers and *humanity* for a couple of hours. <3"
Are you sure you didn't get scammed by those homeless dudes? That's where my mind would go first but I am kinda jaded I guess
"I'm sorry, but were these masks of famous construction workers? I don't know how 4 men in masks would pose as construction workers. Seems like that's not part of a construction worker's costume. Were they safety masks?"
Maybe you and your sister figure out time travel in a few years
When you figure out time traveling could you tell me?
"When I was 10 or so, my mom, dad, and six year old sister went out to dinner. Some gas food place. It was quiet when we arrived and took a table. A couple minutes later this other guy comes in alone and orders and sits down.

In the empty restaurant, he sits across from us. I'm opposite him, and sitting next to my sister. He makes small talk, and since my parents are facing the same direction as he is, they don't look toward him much while talking.

But I do. And I see where he's looking. At my sister. My baby sister.

Dude had to be in his 30s. Full grown man, but skinny enough. I'm 10. And I can't subtly get my mom or dad to see what I'm seeing, or understand why we should leave. So I'm just staring him down.

When it came time to leave, I told them I'd take care of the trash and meet them outside. I took the opportunity to clean up the table. Drop the trash at the bin, and knew my dad would be the one waiting for me at the outside door. I told him when we were outside. 

He sends me to the car, goes back inside, and comes out a few minutes later all red in the face. Thanks me, doesn't say for what, and then announces we can never come back to this place again.

All in all a tense but solid night out."

Creeper awww man
This is a legitimate fear.
Shitty
"That is creepy! Is that the only time he mentioned him? Or did it go on for a while?

We lived in a house that was about 115 years old growing up. From the ages of about 2-4, my little brother matter-of-factly told my mom and I that ""Bob Barker"" would come out of the closet and sit on the end of his bed at naptime and bedtime. (Bob Barker was just what he called any thin old white guy at that age.)

He wasn't scared of Bob, I got the impression he was always kindly. He never said Bob spoke to him, just walked out of the closet and sat there for a while and kind of smiled at him gently before going back in the closet.

He'd see him sometimes in the backyard too, when we were awake. He'd look out his window, which overlooked the yard, and just casually say ""there's Bob.""

It all stopped eventually and he doesn't remember Bob now.

I don't really believe in ghosts, I guess, so I'm not sure what he saw. I used to see fleeting shapes in mirrors in the bathroom near his room, and I was always terrified of the old cellar in the basement. Turned out later that all us kids were afraid of it, though we didn't talk about it at the time. Old houses are weird."
I have to know how you handked that one. I would have shit myself and been simultaneously furious that any fucking thing would be near my child
whaaaaaaat?!
I could have done without that mental image. *weeps*

Dont leave us hanging...what was on the fax?
1408 is a pretty good horror movie imo.
Ey man what was on the fax
"Just watched that movie recently, and it didn't really scare me, but this gave me a whole new perspective."
"It wasn't watching you, it was protecting you. You gave it a nice place to live in the winter, so it will protect you from Intruders. Also, it eats mosquitos and flies."

"This just reminded me of the time I was staying at my cousin's house. When I woke up in the morning and opened my eyes, there was a huntsman spider the size of my hand sitting on my pillow beside my head. I have never got out of bed so quickly."
"A guy I know told me a random story one day. When he was about 12 he went into the bathroom in a convenience store. He was taking a piss and an Indian guy in his 30s comes in and stands in the stall next to him, takes his dick out and starts waving it around. He then tries to rape him and he had to fight him off with his pants down and pissing all over the floor. Someone came in and saved him and the guy got arrested. It might be bad to say but I think it's almost a thing with guys from India. They have a massive rape problem there."
Should have stomped him in the face hard enough to smack the back of his head on the ground. See him explain his way out of that one.
I have heard stories of a cloud like thing chasing people before but it was In the UK
Your judgement was clouded
Aliens.
It sounds like that commercial for Paxil or whatever antidepressant. Are you sure you just weren’t depressed ?
Was it something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD8JPx-QWhY)?
Dementors
Had some 'SHROOMS?
It was the mind flayer!!
Windblown fragment of cloud due to humidity?
Ufo maybe?
What happened after this? I hope he was handled in some way.
You choose to stop on that revelation?
"Dude, you need to tell us what happened!! We're all waiting. Don't leave us hanging like this!"
Did you die?
You can't just say he was standing IN your house and leave us hanging.

And thennnn???
"Something similar happened to me when I was about 10.

Ghostbusters 2 was on TV, so I was sitting in front of the table watching it while my dad and sister were on the couch.

So eventually, the scene with the disembodied heads comes on and I freak out, turn around, and there's nobody on the couch. I lost it and ran to my room.

Apparently they had decided to go for a bike ride, got ready, and left without me noticing."
What the fuck! That's terrifying
Wait why would you talk to someone who's following you??
What happened to your dog??  Did it run with you?  Did you drag it along?
Sounds like four guys not knowing what to do Friday night besides making people shit their pants. I’d probably have started bawling my eyes out.
"Were they on drugs, maybe?"
This gave me some crazy goosebumps wtf
"Ha ha, at least he knows now."
Woah
Now I know to bring pebbles instead of just breaking in. Thanks
Do you still talk to ur brother?
fuck that's so creepy!
"I hope your not around him anymore OP,  cause that is all kinds of messed up ."
Did he ever actually try anything? Did you tell your mom?
"Yeah I had a little brother that did the same thing. Unless he accosted you with it, that sounds like normal sibling stuff. I mean he sounds like he is maybe a little slow though."
The twist is that it's your bro in drag.
"I thought this was a living person, and I wondered why you didn't just call the police on her repeatedly invading your house."
"My most ""creepy"" experience was only watching the family dogs react to some unseen presence walking up to the front door of a house. But I do wonder about the time-line of the thing since that part of the house had been built after my grandparents bought the property."
She probably has no association with your room in her past life.
Be grateful... And summons the spirit of Tangina Barrons to come kick her ass clear out of the house.
Your brother's room must have been important to her. Sounds like a residual haunt. Her energy is stuck on a loop of going into your brother's room.
Cause your room smells
"I started seeing a shadow walk around my house in the start of last year for a few months, it was usually fine and it stopped appearing, it wasn't scared of it at all unless it was doing something creepy like stare at me or being on my dreams. 

The real problem is that since that started I started having a feeling of something moving that I can't explain, like I can feel the air moving around the house. This may not sound scary, but whatever it is feels evil and it makes me uneasy as if there was a suspense music playing. I hope this goes away when I move to another house or I'm fucked, I haven't had a good night sleep in years."
A residual haunting nothing to worry about a just ghost in a loop forever
"Don’t get her attention, then she WILL come to your room."
Your brother's packing and you aren't?
So she literally would just enter your house uninvited and walk into your brother;s room?
Were you anywhere near a cemetery?
"You may have had a run in with a hell hound, but luckily for you they won't pay you any attention unless you have a habit of pissing off witches and demons."

"Your English is bound and leaps above my russian I'm sure, you did a good job. The only thing I didn't understand was

You’re doing great!
that is soooo freaky
"Sounds like sleep paralysis. What you saw and felt was just a hallucination, similar to a dream but while in a state somewhat between sleeping and being awake."
Sleep paralysis
"Sounds like sleep paralysis. It's pretty common, but also terrifying. If I remember correctly, it's caused by a lapse between your brain waking up but your body still being in sleep mode."
"Sleep paralysis is scary, man. I used to read stories about it all the time on Reddit, and then one night it happened to me where I woke up and there was this shadow outside my room and I couldn’t do anything to stop it. Not a fun time"
Amen!  Pure unadulterated fucking terror.
"it's really not that bad at all. if you know about it beforehand, that is. you can become self-aware and the whole thing is a lot less scarier. but if you have no idea wtf is happening then yeah i imagine its terrifying."
"Every time I’ve had it I knew exactly what was going on. It’s weird it never freaked me out just annoyed me . I’d try so hard to move but couldn’t. I never panicked , surprisingly , because I’m a pretty high- strung person ."
*Stranger Things theme song*
"I mean, you kinda brought that on yourself, hope you got away safely."
...Your writing was amazing. Absolutely. Fricking. Terrifying.
"*Fuck this shit, I'm out*"
Fuck. That. Shit. I'm scared to go to bed now lol
Well now he's gonna be a recurring character in MY nightmares. CHEERS
I was so ready for the guy in the trench coat to ask for tree-fiddy. Maybe my dream is that I'm stuck in 2008
"I've had lots of sleep paralysis it used to be like every other night, the technique I've found works best for me is to just fall back asleep. I know it sounds easier said than done but if you practice it, eventually you can just ignore it and fall right back asleep."
Oh thanks I fucking hate it
"I get sleep paralysed as well - and I had to stop reading as I’m in bed trying to fall asleep. Oh well, sleep’s overrated anyway."
That's it I'm never going to sleep again.
"Username checks out. 

That's an insane experience!!"
"Must have been around 5 when I opened the closet door where we kept our towels and saw a skeleton. I slammed the door and ran downstairs screaming. Dinner was ready so I started eating baron the beef and McCain baked fries and that was that. Obviously it was in my head, but holy shit that was scary and I still remember what it looked like 25ish years later."
For some reason the description of its body shape is freaking me out the most
That’s terrifying and heartbreaking. What horrors was he imagining in a strange dark house to be driven to screaming and clawing at a wall. And for you kids to walk in on that and have the presence of mind to call for help... good on you.
What happened?? You can’t just stop there
... then what?? What happened to him? Don’t leave us hanging!
"""Release the shit so you can faster""???  What does that mean?  Did you miss a word or two?"
That was just [Cracker](https://youtu.be/eLUC4gNi7Xc)
Holy shit. What happened (if you don’t mind me asking)? I’m sorry for your loss.
"Nit to rbing up any bad memories or anything, but if sokeone dies from erotic auto asphyxiation it doesnt seem to be so... Bad? 

Like they were pleasuring themselves and something went wrong. Not much worse than having a heart attack while having sex. 

Of course the loss is devestating but intbhe moment of death you know there was pleasure."
"Ok but you've gotta give him some credit for being a clever bastard. Just sucks that his prank was *exactly* your childhood fear. Not bullying you, btw- I'd have been scared shitless too!"
"This is poignant and heartbreaking. Also darkly poetic. I know it's cheap for a random internet stranger to say, ""I hope you get the help you need,"" but I really do. At least you realize *you're* not the demon. I hope you find a light in your darkness. <3"
Sending you a virtual hug. I genuinely hope that you get the help you need. We’re here for you man.
So........why the hell didn't you ask her?
What does PP mean? I’m guessing something like pedophile?

"I woke up to a spider in my shirt once, except I didn’t realize it was a spider until I killed it by scratching my chest."
Is it incestuous if the spider were a daddy long legs?
"Well, did you beat it ^^"
Scary!
She lost. Get over it
Gimme the deets
"We need more information than that, OP"
Care to describe?
Pretty sure that was a cat
If it ever happens again recite the Lords Prayer and call on Jesus. Demons will back the fuck off from the Light.
I'm intrigued.
It was definitely a hypnagogic hallucination. Happens to me all the time being narcoleptic. Incredibly scary and realistic. Hope it was a one-timer for you.
Running out in traffic for a cup?
Aaaaaaand?
What happened next?
Oh. My. Fucking. God.
Oh shit. I’m sorry for your loss. That’s horrible.
paranoia paranoia everybody's comin ta get me
Read about hypnagogic hallucinations. I experience this quite a lot. One of my reoccurring hallucinations is the about a lot of spiders crawling out from everywhere into the bed. I go ballistic every time searching for them in the sheets.
Yes !! I love reading this shit haha
Pls add more. Reply to my comment pls
"JESUS, you really are lucky! Glad you made it through that, I bet it was really scary."
That sub is ruined and filled up with made up shit
You don't live near Chernobyl do you...
What kind of puppet was it?. I have puppets but they're lovely.
What did it look like?
"I'll agree with you that sudden silence in nature is definitely creepy. 

I had the opposite happen a few years ago, when I was sitting on my back deck. Suddenly, there were *thousands* of birds, in really dense flocks, flying fairly low to the ground (maybe 30-40 feet up), absolutely screeching. This lasted for a good 10-15 minutes, and there were so many I could actually hear the ""wind"" of their wings. They covered a huge portion of the sky, and there just kept being more and more of them. Certainly nothing paranormal, but it was extremely bizarre and unsettling."
I also play dcuo
"Definitely fucking creepy. When I was a teenager I was the only child and living with my mother. She died suddenly and after a series of events I wound up living in the middle of very small town, lots of land, nothing to do... Anywho, my ""friend"" and I (all going through some shit of our own) decide it'd be interesting to pray to the devil... which then led me to wanting to try and summon a demon, on my own, in my dark candle lit bathroom. I googled demons, found one that I wanted, still remember its name to this very day. Anyways after that bullshit I start hearing knocks on my headboard every night which continues to happen in my new college dorm and everyone there thought our dorm was haunted and two of the girls took to sleeping in the living room, but since the motherfucker knocked on my headboard every night I grew kind of apathetic towards the whole ""haunted"" thing. Fast forward a year and I'm living with a now ex, every time I'm alone the door to the laundry room creaks open and then slams shut, ex's guitar falls down, the entire DVD rack and DVDs falls down, shower curtain plunges into the toilet. I started getting suicidal thoughts about standing on the railroad track outside our building, and one night it straight up tapped on my shoulder. That's when I lost it. Boyfriend opened a Bible and read out loud with me for IDK how long and suddenly I could tell it wasn't... gripping me? To this day I'm not sure how to interpret what I experienced but it left, and I havent said the things name ever since."
Well you have to explain that one. Doesn't seem possible
Aww man
"I’m so sorry for your losses. It sounds like they went peacefully, though, so I hope that comforts you a little ♥️"
aww man
Wow. I would have done it.
"Those kind of people do not deserve a plastic box, that story is extremely fucked up"

"This is in no way your fault.  I hope you have a good life withyour mother and you are *never* made to feel like it was. It wasn't.  He was a scum bag hitting on not only his girlfriend's daughter, but a pedo for hitting on a young teenage girl.  Talk, write, paint... whatever healthy activity you want to get it out, but it wasn't your fault.  Even if you smiled more than usual or wore something nice.  He is a grown up and a sorry excuse for a man.  Sorry you had to go through that... you definitely aren't alone."
Why don't you just keep scrolling and ignore it? It's not going to stop.
Damn. I felt that.
I was thinking of the scary story “The Thing” from Scary Stories to tell in the Dark.
That made me think of “It Follows” until I read the end.
"I asked him about it after and he said he did it because he didn’t want the guy to feel scared of *us*, which is very thoughtful and good natured. I had jumped straight to ‘we’re going to get murdered’."
"Update: I checked with him and he said you were correct, it was to get an indication of what the deal was."
"maybe he had a cold or flu and his voice was a little raspy or umm, hoarse?"

"I honestly was running through in my mind how fast I thought I could run, where the nearest point I could get phone signal was, whether we would be able to keep our balance if we ran full speed down the hill etc., I was properly scared of that fucking horse."
"With moonlight, it’s pretty easy to walk on a road without a flashlight. Walking in a field however where there are rabbit holes and uneven ground, you’d definitely want a flashlight at night + as I said, the only reason to be in the field would be checking livestock which you’d need a flashlight for."
"I don’t remember posting it but it was a few years ago now that it happened, so I might have done."
"Where I am from this would’ve been a bear, moose, mountain lion or coyote"
Not like this...Not like this.
Borzois (aka Russian Wolfhounds) are even creepier imo
"Nah, once the lights were the dog was really chill. Tbh, I've always been more of a cat person anyway."
"I'm so glad he was caught, and that the experience didn't mess you up too much. It's been 14 years for me and I'm still a little paranoid about making sure the doors and windows are secure at night. It doesn't help that the cops never caught the guy and had very little to go on - he wore gloves and I wasn't able to give a good description. Hopefully being chased out put him off ever trying something like that again."
I am very glad that you were not physically hurt and that he was caught. It seems these sicko predators never are or it takes many offenses.
How did he get in? Intruder window?
"Did you know the guy on some level, or was this guy completely random?"
[removed]
Yeah. I wish someone would break into *my* house.
"It wasn't fear to begin with, it was rage.  The fear kicked in between him getting away and the police arriving.  That adrenaline rush when your body knows you're in danger before you consciously grasp it is intense.

It never made me want to sleep with a gun - which would be highly illegal in my country anyway - but a cricket bat was kept handy and I slept with lights on for a long time after that."
"A gun wouldn't have helped me even if it would have been legal to have one within reach (Australia's gun laws are specific about proper storage/security as well as ownership). My reaction was pure instinct, and it turns out that grabbing a weapon wasn't part of that instinct."
Thanks. I got so lucky that night. I'm normally a heavy sleeper - I've literally slept through an earthquake. I still don't know what made me wake up that night but I'm so glad it did.
"Apparently my 'fight or flight' response is heavily geared towards fight because as soon as it clicked that this was not right,  I leaped out of bed and ran after him. I chased him through the apartment, out the door he'd already opened as a prepared escape (he'd entered through a different door), down the stairs, down an alley and into the street behind my building before he got far enough ahead that I gave up. If I'd caught him I was fully prepared to beat the shit out of him.  I didn't consciously decide to chase him, I just reacted. I don't normally run for anything - I like to joke that I wouldn't even run if my house was on fire - but this was just an automatic, adrenaline-fuelled reaction. It wasn't until later that I realised how stupid it was to chase him."
"I don't remember yelling anything, I may have shouted 'hey!' or 'what the fuck?!' or something like that. 

It took me a few moments to register what was going on between waking up and leaping out of bed, but there wasn't really any time to think of a strategy or anything. I just reacted. My reaction surprised me - if someone had asked me how I'd react to finding an intruder in my home, I would never have answered that I'd chase them or be prepared to fight them but that's exactly what I did. If I'd stopped to think in the moment I probably would have stayed still and tried to be quiet, but the adrenaline kicked in and I was moving without thinking about it."
The police thought differently.
"People who just want to steal shit generally break in during the day when the homeowner is likely to be at work. People who break in at night are either intending or are on their way to committing worse crimes.

“Burglary is often destructive to property, but is not threatening to people. MOST burglaries happen during the day when typically nobody is at home. There is a deliberate attempt by the burglar to avoid contact with residents. Often when discovered burglars flee. That's what makes night prowlers more dangerous. By breaking in at night they knowingly are increasing their chances of running into someone who lives there. This is a behavior among those who do not fear using violence or are looking for an excuse to use it. Is this always the case? No, but it is a common attitude among those willing to break in at night.”

"I hope so. Other people are saying it's probably not sleep paralysis because I could move, which doesn't make me feel any better."
"I didn't know how to describe the position he was in until I found out what planking was. I used to just say ""he was laying flat with his arms stuck to his sides."""
"Maybe. I've chalked it up to sleep paralysis because I don't really believe in ghosts or stuff like that anymore but yeah I could move. Later experiences with sleep paralysis also kind of contributed to that conclusion. I had similar things occur up until I was probably 11 or 12, though not nearly as scary. Mostly people standing next to my bed or heavy breathing. During those I was definitely immobile."
I've read about that. A few weeks ago I woke up to the sound of screaming and my house was empty. Normally though they'll occur when I'm trying to fall asleep and I'll hear people whispering my name or talking.
"It’s called dissociation and is very common in situations that represent life-threatening circumstances where you experience a loss of control and have a sense of powerlessness.

"Not as extreme, but I once had to be picked up from a sleepover because my friend had a toy of that baby doll spider from Toy Story on his shelf and I refused to be in the same room as it. Like, I was completely inconsolable lmao"
There is indeed.
I played it on my Wii for hours and missed saying goodbye to my grandparents before. I never played it again. That traumatized me more than possibly dying being unsafe on a water slide
Ahh I love a good logical explanation
"You had a security system where if anyone walked around upstairs it would set off alarms? What?

At least your story wasn't bullshit like all the others in this thread. 

""YOU DONT KNOW, YOU WERENT THERE!"" I don't need to be there to know you're making up a story about ghosts. The scientific community would literally laugh at these posts."
"That might be the case, but it just felt so real at the time."
No it was ghosts
I can tell that you're just on here to act like a smartass instead of appreciating these experiences. My logic is that you should go on a subreddit that has to do with science and not paranormal stuff.

"I’m an engineer (a lighting one, nonetheless) who likes to think rationally, so no. Not really. Just *really* bad luck. 

The most common type of light to go out over my head were street lights, which have no direct interaction with me whatsoever."
Mind flayer
I have this issue too.
"I have a more mild version of the extra static electricity problem. Can't wear watches with batteries (analog or digital displays) because after two weeks of wear they act dead for about a month and then suddenly the battery comes back to life. My smartphones will have a spot in the middle of the screen that at the end of the day will act as if I'm repeatedly tapping it, which is a huge annoyance and has clicked on ads for me, but usually happens when I should be going to sleep."
"Hmm... that is interesting, have you ever gotten blood work done? Do you have anything odd or unique about you diet?"
"I'm not sure how to explain all of that, but commonly, streetlights do turn off completely and then cycle through periodically.  I think this is specifically the old sodium arc lights.  I witnessed this several times and started to freak out until a friend pointed out that it's normal."
"Man, I am so glad it isn't just me."
"My mom has this, she's one of those very spiritual people, which, there's nothing wrong with i guess. She says the term is called being a slider. Basically, she can't wear watches because when she does, everytime without fail, they stop working within the hour. Not the battery running out. It just breaks and is irreparable. Also light bulbs, biro pens, hair straighteners and the general electrics in our home, and every home we ever lived in goes bat shit crazy. Kettles will just boil and boil, refusing to switch off until it gets scary like it's going to explode. She says her electromagnetic field is very high for  person, I'm not sure if the specifics but if you Google 'slider' it will probs pop up with some info"
thank you
"And kids are so stupid, he’d say he “didn’t realize someone could drown that fast” despite intentionally holding someone under water. These little sociopathic bullies make my blood boil."

Then they both dropkicked the shit out of them. Craziest 5 minutes of my life. 

But yeah, I always felt bad about us going to White Castle. I'm sure they had the gut rot pretty bad after that meal. Especially if they hadn't eaten in a while."
Totally possible I suppose. Maybe I remember it more fondly because I hadn't been jaded yet.
"Aw shucks you got me. I made the whole thing up thanks for snopsing me! You really are a true scholar! It couldn't have been in a dark area and no area lighting. Oh my, reflective gear and hard hats certainly don't throw people off! Especially if the masks were kind of a inhalation mask. Oh My! It was three, but maybe... Oh my god the masks created a fourth?

"I have never felt like I wasn’t self aware when I experienced sleep paralysis. Every time it occurred, I thought that I was actually awake in the dream until I woke up. I think the feeling of consciousness is just one reason why sleep paralysis IS so fucking terrifying."
I was going to say this as well. once its happened 50+ times the fear seems to lessen.
"I had my first sleep paralysis a few weeks ago. I immediately knew what it was so I only had to deal with not being able to move and even tho my head was trying to imagine creepy stuff in my bedroom (i.e. lamp has a face, eyes staring at me from my window) I knew that it was just my imagination so I was able to just fall asleep"

"Unfortunately, it's like in the movies. You saw a normal person, and, when they are triggered, they completely change. It is very difficult to describe, and terrifying. They scream with impossible sounds or impossible languages, they become impossibly  strong (you need many people to hold them). One time I saw this tiny little woman swearing in an ancient dialect with a man voice. The law of physics don't count more.
The most horrible thing is looking them in the eyes. In some moment you see how terrified and in pain they are.
I can't get used to that."
"Thank you. Even after 10 years, it's still hard to deal with. Then my uncle passing in a similar way just brought up a lot of feelings."

If he had a small amount of drugs he would be in prison forever but future pedophiles and killers with a long history of offenses are always back on the streets no matter how many times they get caught doing countless crines
In-tru-da window you mean. Updoot for the whovian
He was on drugs. I personally have no idea why he even confessed to be honest. There was no evidence other than the breaking and entering. Seems stupid to make your sentence worse. Don't do drugs kids.
"Ugh yes. I was in a motorcycle accident last year. Bike was a write off but I only tore the ligaments in my foot/ankle.  
Oh you were so lucky.  
No dickhead, I'd have been lucky if the other dude had missed me and I hadn't lost my bike and 3 weeks of wages.  
I had my daughter on the back, completely unharmed, but she's too scared to get back on and I've lost my riding buddy. Mother and 10 year old daughter on a motorcycle was such a beautiful thing.  
Yeah. Lucky.  
She'd have been lucky if he'd broken in next door."
"You might not consciously notice things when you’re asleep, but your subconscious does, and your subconscious sensed you were in danger that night and woke you up. The human body & mind are amazing things."
The human body is amazing at sensing danger.
I‘ll bet that God was like “Nope! Not tonight!”
"I sometimes imagine what I would do in an intruder situation, and I always hope I'd have a fight reaction.

Deep in the core of my being, there's this burning feeling of not being able to tolerate anyone who tries to inflict terror on someone else. I really hope that that feeling comes to the surface if I ever need it.

I'm not even a violent person, and I would never advocate violence unless absolutely necessary, but I daydream often of going all out on someone who tries to threaten me or my family."
"I know this is two weeks later, but I think that means you're geared towards fight? Flight would be running away from the danger, not running after it with intentions to beat the shit out of it lol."

"I'd shit the bed, die of a heart attack and then most likely also kick the bucket."
"I get this if there’s a floor fan on when I’m laying down. Sometimes it’s been so distinct I can pick out the rhythm that’s playing, it’s almost as if there’s a small radio in the room with me. Only happens when there’s other white noise though."

"""A ghost almost killed m-"" ""there's a bakugan game"""
"Same here. I don't believe in ghosts, so I am always excited when someone actually figures out what is ""haunting"" them, because it so very rarely happens."
"Sorry if it isnt clear, but that house is single-story, and the alarm was only on at night  Basically, the alarm is the kind that goes off when doors and windows open, but it also comes with a motion sensor pointed down the hallway leading to the bedrooms. Its not complex or expensive or anything, just two little boxes pointed at each other that set the alarm off if something passes between them when the system is armed. Since a straight line between the sensors cuts through most of the hallway's length at an angle, it's more or less impossible to walk down it without tripping the system at some point. My parents used to turn it on most nights when we first moved (maybe, in retrospect, because of the noises the house made lol). I don't think this is super uncommon in home security systems...


Also, part of the reason I posted this is because the ghost thing felt so real, even though I wasnt a kid at the time. If I'd been writing this a few years earlier, before I figured it out, the tone would definitely be similar to the other stories here, despite the fact that I'm a scientist and generally a rational person. The thing is, this shit is scary when you dont have a rational explanation - its surprisingly hard to logic the ""monkey brain"" part of you out of frozen terror by telling yourself ghosts cant exist."
The alarm thing had me 🤦🏻‍♀️ too hahaha! This made me laugh so hard
"When I was 9 or 10 I had a fever hallucination that a vampire was trying to kill me and there were fairies fluttering above my head doing nothing to help me. The memory feels very real like that's what actually happened, but I know I was sick and none of that is plausible, plus when I finally was able to get out of bed my mom asked why I was screaming, she said she tried my door but it was locked which explains a lot except why she didn't break down the friggin door when her very ill child was screaming. 


Anyway, there could be something about the house since you said others had experiences."

I stumbled into a situation once where a guy was inappropriately touching a young girl when I walked in. I didn’t know either of them but I flipped and I beat him badly. I don’t like to tell the story but when it does come up I don’t go and add ‘yeah and he had brain swelling, busted out teeth, etc’ there’s nothing to brag about in these kind of situations and certain details don’t need to be rehashed for some strangers enjoyment or approval. 

You skepticism is frustrating and you should just refrain from commenting instead of disparaging a young girls experience."

I don’t know if this is a joke but that’s not how rabies works
"Yeah,  rabies doesnt work that way. Once you get symptoms, you're already dying. Surviving rabies after becoming symptomatic is *extremely* rare, and if it had happened to you you would definitely know (the months you spent in the hospital would be a good clue, for starters)."
"Not how rabies works, so you’re full of shit."
Nah
Yeah it’s like that with my bf. Although I was sayin that he doesn’t get the scary hallucinations that ppl get. But yeah he does try to scream/shout I can hear him moaning and I shake him or sometimes I have to be more aggressive to break him out of it and slap him a little lol

I have worked with many broke people who were sure they were millionaires and one legit millionaire who was convinced he was broke. Refused to heat his crappy bedsit properly and lived off rice and beans. He was a nice guy just so sad all the time because his delusions made him feel he could never make ends meet. He had capgras syndrome too so was convinced his only surviving relative was an imposter and was lying to him about his wealth.
"Thank you for asking! I'm ok. It was 7 years ago. I couldn't get him to go to a medical doctor. He finally did see an eye specialist because he couldn't see color anymore.

No one knew he had any of those things. I think he knew."
"> some pedos never touch thier own kids.

That just shows that they know what they're doing is wrong. If they're indiscriminate about who they target, someone could argue that maybe there's some crossed wires about morality, but that argument is much weaker if you have the wherewithal to not harm people you care about."

"I was playing with my friend at a playground near my house. It was around dusk and we had been there for about an hour, when we both stopped and immediately sprinted back to my house without saying a word to each other. Turns out we had both had the same dark, terrible feeling in our gut and knew we had to get out of there. 


The next morning we went back and found a cat head in the playground, just the skull and fur, nothing else, no brain or eyes or anything. We think it might have been a mountain lion as they are prevalent in our area.

It's hard to explain that awful gut feeling, but I've never been so scared without being in any noticeable danger in my life."
"This is pretty silly actually. When I was a kid, I had a Barbie that came with a little baby. This baby unsettled me for some reason, something about its face was spooky. One day, I stopped playing and started to walk out of my bedroom, but something compelled me to go back to turn the baby's face away from me first. I went to the bathroom, came back, and the baby's face had somehow turned back to its original position, facing me. Understandably, I had an absolute fit. I cried to my mom and she told me that she had gone in my room and moved the doll, but later admitted that she lied to stop my hysterics. We hid the blasted thing, but it would reemerge every couple of years. I think it's funny now, but I still wonder. "

I was shaking uncontrollably, she had to carry me inside, it took half an hour to wake me up. When asked what happened, apparently half conscious me answered ""I was following the pony"" "
"When I was in high school, to earn extra money, I went and cleaned my dad's boss' office building on the weekends. Most of the time it was just me in there. Occasionally, someone would be in there working. It was never full though. Usually, if anyone was there, it was this one dude. I still don't know what he did there. But, his office was WAY in the back of the building, almost in what I would call a closet. This was a construction company, and they had this big office with a giant table in it where they could spread out blueprints and go over them together. This guy's office was in a closet behind this office. I worked there for years, and as I did, I kinda got to know this guy. I eventually bought myself a jeep wrangler when I turned 16, and he was a jeep guy himself, so we would always BS about jeep stuff. Honestly a really cool dude. The one thing that always stuck out to me about this guy, is he had this ""tick""... Nothing weird, but noticeable. When he was standing and talking to you, he always stood with his left side facing you, with his left hand in his pocket and he would jingle his change in his pocket... 

Well, the guy eventually died in the office one day. Not while I was there, during the work week. I remember my dad telling me about it and offering to let me go to the funeral, which I did.


A few weeks later, I'm in there cleaning. I'm not in the blueprint room, but in a room across the hall and I hear the front door open. They had a sensor on the door that made a loud ""DING"" noise when someone opened it. So, I heard ""DING!"" and could hear footsteps walking in. So, I'm sitting at this desk, dusting all this person's nick-nacks and I hear that guy's voice say ""Hey, Gibby, how's the jeep runnin?"". I'm kinda shocked and just staring at this person in the doorway, left side facing me, and jingling change in his pocket. I'm pretty much frozen in the chair just staring at him, and he kinda laughs a little. It seemed like he was about to walk away, and I kinda shuddered a second once everything registered in my brain. So, I blinked and when I looked back at the door, he was gone. I walked around the entire office and no one was there.

From that day on, any time I went into his office, I said out loud ""Hey, <name>. Wish you could see what I've done with the jeep"" or something else like that. Always felt like he was in there still.

Dad has since retired from work, and I don't get to go up to that office any more. But, on the off chance I do, I like to walk in that office (it's their gym now) and say hello."

Apparently the step brother grabbed his gun and told our host that if we didn't leave he was going to kill us all.

It was literally insane. He seemed like a regular dude, and I don't think anyone detected anything wrong. It was scary to see a total 180 like that. Also, the fact that he was unstable and was armed.

At night, no matter the weather, there is what appears to be a thick blue fog moving along the ground. I've never actually seen anything personally, but we did hear muffled voices and what sounded like footsteps in the dense tree line right next to us. We tucked tail and took off."

"I live in an apartment with 6 of my girl friends. One day, all of my roommates went to a concert except for me and one other. We went to pick them up, got home around 11PM, and ordered pizza. About 20 mins after ordering I hear a knock at the door, and I assume it’s the pizza being delivered. Instead, it’s this random man I’ve never seen before, telling me that he watched us get out of the car and would like to come in to talk to us as we are all beautiful…. Keep in mind it is 11:30 at night on a SUNDAY. He started to angle his body closer to the door, so then my roommate’s boyfriend came to the door where he was visibly shocked, uncomfortable and started to fidget. After telling him to fuck off, we realized he followed us home from the concert.

Being a woman can suck sometimes.

"Visual hallucinations brought on by the wrong combo of psych meds gave me by far the scariest and most unsettling experiences of my life.  The unsettling part was losing my reading comprehension skills.  I'd read a comment on the discussion board I was frequenting at the time and it could say something as benign as, ""I had a lovely breakfast have a great day"" and I'd read it as ""AbortRetryImplode you're a failure.  You should die.""  So I'd write this angry response ripping the person a new one and then I'd get these sometimes apologetic sometimes ""wtf is wrong with you?"" responses in my inbox and I'd be totally confused.       
The scariest was looking in the mirror and realizing I looked evil.  I wouldn't say demonic...but the way I was smiling and my eyes.  I looked so evil it was terrifying.  Kind of like something else had control of my face and I was seeing me, but not me?  I know it probably doesn't make sense but it scared the shit out of me."
"One I've mentioned before in a different thread.

I was lay in bed trying to get my daughter to go to sleep and she was refusing to.

As I was getting more annoyed with her I asked ""Why won't you go to sleep?"" Her response was ""Because those two people are watching us."" and pointed to the corner of the room where no one was stood (we were alone in the house).

Immediately picked her up and spent the night asleep downstairs."
"I was babysitting this little kid, and we decided to go on a walk. We saw this creepy-looking abandoned house down the street. The windows were all smashed. The kid pointed up at the house and asked me, ""VirtualEyeroll, why is that man staring at us?"" I said ""What man?"" He said ""Don't you see him? He's inside the house."" I just got really freaked out and said that we should go back home. We practically ran back to his house.

"Let me preface by saying I have only told this story to three or four people my entire life, and none of them believed me. I am aware I will sound crazy, but I swear to you this 100% happened to me when I was about 13 years old. Yes, I am sure I was not dreaming. No, we did not have a gas leak. 

When I was about 13 years old, I was having trouble sleeping (it was probably 1am or thereabouts). I was restless, tossing and turning, the whole bit. Well I had almost given up and was just staring blankly at the wall next to my bedroom door, when the door begins to open, slowly. 

Now, we had a cat at this time so the door not being properly closed and then pushed open by a feline friend would not have been outside of the norm, so at this point I’m still calm.  But then I take a look into the opening gap between the door and the frame. 

Through the gap is a man in a black coat of some kind, with a white mask over his face, who is humming very soft and low. I immediately gasp (trying not to scream) and pull the covers over my face. My heart is racing and I’m listening for anything—any little movement. I don’t hear anything but I begin to hear that humming again and through my blanket make out a soft, amber light. 

I decide this change may signal more immediate danger, so I summon all my courage and pull the covers down off my face--- he’s gone. I look around the room and the man is no longer there. From outsidem however, I see that same amber light. I walk, slowly, tensely over to the window and peer out. 

Hanging in the air, at the same level as my second floor bedroom window is a little orb of amber light which, although featureless makes a bounce-like motion that I (and I understand this sounds crazy) took to mean as it acknowledging me. It then moved through the air toward the tree line in back of our house and disappeared. 

I still wonder what it is I saw.

"I moved into a new place in a new county. 

After a night at the pub, I got the feeling I was being followed. Turned around - huge black dog with red eyes glaring at me. I ran home, locked the doors. 

Then I started getting nightmares about the thing hunting me down. And every time I was out at night, it was getting closer and closer... 

I put it down to the stress of moving. 

Well, until a friend of mine stayed the night to ease my mind. I found her awake at 3am looking out the window, dog outside, she was pale as a sheet. She just whispered ""That's a fucking hellhound."" 

In the morning, she ran out of my house, came back a few hours later with this awful smelling powder, and hung it up in pouches around the room, with an extra pouch for me to carry. 

Never seen the dog again. Never had a nightmare about it since. 

Edit: mobile posted it too early. Had to redo it. "
"My husband and I moved away so he could finish his degree at a more reputable university. His uncle happens to live in the same town as the school. We would hang out with his uncle and grill out, watch movies and play his really nice instruments. Really nice guy overall and someone two broke college aged kids could lean on if needed in a town where we knew no one.

His uncle's friend started coming to some of our little shin-digs. All was well with his uncle's friend, except for a few flirtatious comments, which I just shrugged off. He was about 20 years older than me, I was a girl in my early 20's, I thought maybe it was his personality. 

I was working in property management and the friend told me he was looking for a new apartment. Seeing a business opportunity and a chance to help a family friend, I gave him my business card. 

About a week later, his uncle's friend comes into my office. I was happy to see him assuming he was looking for an apartment. Nope. He proceeds to hand me a three page typed letter which is folded and tells me ""This is probably the last time you will ever see me."" He turned around and left. No explanation, so I read the letter.

The letter basically declared his love for me and stated his intentions to 'win me over'. It said something along the lines of him beating my husband in karate. Also, he went on about how the men in my husband's family are basically damaged and it wouldn't work between my husband and I. He said it was a warning. It was a deranged rambling from a man I encountered maybe four times in my life.

Startled at my desk, I told my manager who I was pretty close with so he was aware of the situation. That afternoon my husband and I went to the police station to put the letter 'on file'. Luckily I've never encountered that guy again, but now I think twice about handing out my business cards."
"When my mom was a kid, she had this horrible stuffed clown with a plastic face. I searched the internet and found this image, which is pretty spot on

Anyway, one day we (my brothers and I) brought it home from my grandparents house. Not sure why. We hated the thing. It was obviously creepy as all hell. 

Once it was home, it would move from where we put it. You would leave it on the chair, leave the room, come back it would be on the bed. 

We decided to take it and put it in a box, and put weights on top of the box. We came back and it had moved the weights as the box, and was sitting in the chair. This was in the basement, so no one would have been able to get to it without going down the stairs, which is the way we exited and entered. 

We then left the room again with it on the chair. Came back and it was outside the house, staring into the basement window. There is no way it could have got out the window (didn't open) or past us on the stairs. 

We then gave it a book and a pen and left the room. It wrote on the front of the book (it was a kids book about Houdini, I'll never forget it) the name ""Mike Stapher"" in almost movie style scratchy scrawls writing. 

Most horrifying thing I've ever encountered. 

We told my parents and they destroyed it. "
"My step dad got piss drunk. Pulled a gun and shot up the house. He was pointing it at my mom threatening her and I just go in front him, he pushed me and I just kept backing him up calmly talking to him keeping the gun pointing somewhere else, the sight on the gun scratched my belly and I didn't notice it till later. Usually under stress I freak out. I can't handle driving in Indianapolis with out screaming and beating my steering wheel. I don't know how I remained so composed. It was unsettling for me because I don't know where that came from, in that moment I don't know what I was doing I was just doing it. No one was hurt and he just spent the night in jail, he's been going through some serious addiction issues. He lost his dad and a twin brother back to back and he's losing his mom. "

"I have no problem with cemeteries, hospitals, funeral homes, etc., but the place that creeped me out the most was the wrecker yard. My husband was involved in a 5 car accident where 2 people died. We went to the wrecker lot to get some stuff out of the car. I have never felt that uneasy at a place, just the vibe, I could just feel something was off.  "

"When I was growing up, my dad had a private investigator follow us around, we found out about it from a friend of the family, as the PI approached my friends mom after he had trailed me to their house a few times and one day, after I left he went and had a chat, paid them to not say anything, but they did anyway. We later found out he had approached like 6 or 7 other friends parents about the same set of questions.  After we found out, we had another 9 years of being followed, constantly looking over our shoulder for a gold chevy with blacked out windows, every time we'd spot it, there he was with his camera. There was nothing we could do, as he had broken no laws. Going to the mall? There he was... Going to a friends birthday party? There he was... Found out about it in 1991, stopped caring about it in 2000. (FYI, got back in touch with my dad when I was 29, in 2009, and have seen a selection of the pictures that were returned to him, so at least my mother and I know it had been actually happening all those years.)"

"Scary in the moment, scarier after.  

Was hanging out in a park drinking with some friends and these random 3 guys come by and start chatting with us.  Mainly me. (only guy) 

I offer them my alcohol as I don't want it.  We chat more.  They start walking away and I'm in mid conversation with a guy, so I walk with them a bit and the guy turns me to and says ""What are you gonna do?"" before I knew it, they had met up with other guys behind me and there's 6 guys around me, punching and pushing.  I get knocked in my face pretty good and go down. They continue kicking and walk away.  

I get up furious and break an empty bottle and they start yelling things, while the girls realize what just happened and surround me and bring me to the closest guys house.   

They come back with 20+ people, girls, guys, and we had already called them cops.  Cops catch about 5, 2 of the main guys I was talking to.  Turns out they had knives on them.   Scary/lucky enough nothing worse happened to me except a black eye and a few cuts.  

A year later one of the guys goes to prison for murder.  Sent a chill down my spine that I almost got in a fight, rather than a beat down, with a murderer.  "
"That time I believed the government were listening to every conversation and the New World Order was an imminent threat for months.

"My cousin was staying at or house for a weekend.  My sister was good friends with her and they were set to sleep in the basement together.  Me, being the younger sister, desperately wanted to stay down there with them.  I fell asleep and had the most terrifying and realistic nightmare of my life.  They went into the bathroom and came out as monsters who told me I had to fall asleep or they were going to eat me.  For *YEARS* I thought I had actually had that nightmare and it still scared me to think about.  Last year my sister admitted to actually doing that and I found out it wasn't a nightmare but they tortured me like that for real!"
"I have a good story, but since I have posted it before I am going to tell a more recent story, which actually happened to my brother 2 weeks ago in the house we grew up in.


So, my brother still lives there with my grandma. Brothers room is in the basement. In the living room, there is a huge glass sliding door that opens onto our deck, with a large shared courtyard behind it. At about 2 am, my brother hears this door slide open. He is still up gaming or whatever. He yells, ""HELLO?"" and hears a mans voice, say ""hello"" back, very calmly. Scared, he yells ""WHO IS THIS"" and the man calmly replies, ""John"". ""Well John, this isn't you're house so you better leave"" and John replies, ""well it used to be"" as he walks towards the kitchen and opens the fridge ( my brother assumes from the noises he hears). 


Scared, my brother stays downstairs and calls the police. It takes the police over 30 minutes to respond (if you can believe that!) and by the time they get there, there is no man in the house or any trace of it.


My Grandma has owned that house for 25 years. "
"As a child my dad was a drunk. One night my dad an I alone camping in a yurt went 4-wheeling at midnight. He was wasted. It was a jacked up old Ford Ranger, being a pretty light truck, when my dad hit the edge of the cliff on our way back, it was teetering on edge. My dad told me to get out, I was maybe 5-6 years old. Truck was stuck so we walked back to camp, it was about 2 miles away. Halfway there my feet got tired so my dad put me on his shoulders, looking behind him. I stared into the green eyes of a giant mountain lion following us. The increase in stature scared him off, and I watched him book it up the mountain. Haunts me to this day."
"I used to date a girl who had a small dog and a daughter, who at the time she was about 4-years-old. One night we were laying in bed trying to go to sleep and the dog came running into our room which isn't too uncommon. Her dog went from my side of the bed and stood up and then went under the bed to the other side of the bed and stood up. When she was on my side I would look over and pet her and when she was on my ex's side I would roll over and play with her again. This happened a hand-full of times. On the last time, she was on my ex's side while we both played with her and she ran under the bed so I rolled over.... 

There was a little girl standing right in-front of me in a pitch black room with her hair fully covering her face. I was never as scared as I was that night. I screamed so loud she started crying and I realized who she was. It was her daughter who came into our room after not being able to sleep... "
"My wife and I bought a house in 2011 that had been vacant for 13 years prior.  We renovated right away and then moved in.  Our 1-year old daughter began acting as though she was terrified of someone or something my wife and I could not see or hear.  More concerned for my daughter's safety than my own insecurities about whether or not ghosts are real, I pursued that option so as to rule it out.  Long story short, a medium cleared the house out of the kindness of his heart.  He didn't want anything but we made him dinner.  Sure enough my young daughter's behavior shifted that night.  And a 1-year old just doesn't have the ability to comprehend what he was doing.  Hell, I barely comprehended it.  Kids are wide open and really just respond to the stimulus in their environment.  My life hasn't been the same since that experience.

*edit - replaced the word abandoned with the word vacant since it was still being minimally cared for but nobody was living in it for 13 years"
"I've told this before and it always gets buried. We were driving in the mountains in Colorado with some friends on our way to a ski lodge in Telluride. On the way to our hotel we were driving up and down these winding roads deep deep in the mountains which seemed like forever. It was pitch black outside and around 3AM and we had to at least be 45ish minutes from the nearest town, and it was cold, like see your own breath below 10 degrees freezing cold. 
As we were driving along, my friends and I all see 4 figures walking on the road coming towards us. We all get weird feelings inside but I did especially, and the hair on my neck stood up. Something didn't seem right. We were way too far away from a town and it was wayyy too cold for hitch hikers or hikers of any sort. We get closer and closer and as we got right next to these ""people"" we slow down and we realized that they had NO Faces! 4 people walking in the dead of the night wearing black hoods and cape like gowns and they literally had no faces. And by no faces I mean like no eyes, mouth, ears, just blank white pale faces. I'm familiar with ski masks and these were not ski masks. They had hoods on like something from Scream almost. My friends and I all freaked the fuck out speeding away, and my toughest manliest friend of us all was crying, mind you he was in his late 20s. It was the most afraid I've ever been and it still scares me thinking about and typing out. No idea what they were or anything. Demons maybe? It will forever be a mystery. We didn't sleep well the next few nights/months. "
"November 8, 2007, I watched as a drowning victim was pulled from a local lake. He was an older guy, maybe 60, dressed in biking gear. A pair of runners and I discovered him floating about ten feet from the biking/walking path, and while the woman ran to get help - cell phone signal was poor - the male went down into the lake to pull the guy out. Another couple stopped and while the man helped the first guy, his female partner gagged. I was almost in shock. I just couldn't believe this was happening. When they tried to give him CPR till the paramedics arrived, I could tell the old man was already dead. Blood was coming from his nose and his gaze was fixed and clouded over. We had to give statements to the police as the rescue team worked in vain to bring the victim back. They put these quick warming things on him and took him away. Every time I return to the lake, I always think of that man and his watery death."
"My dad used to work at an Oxxo, when I was like 9. It's a gas station in Mexico. He worked night shifts and the stores stayed open 24/7. Night time in Mexico is when it gets bad and when everybody goes inside and it is when all the cartels and Marines come out and if they run into each other there's a shootout that's for sure going to happen. Well one night at about 2 AM 3 trucks pulled up and everybody got off, about 14 men in body armor, Gloves, boots, black cargo pants, leaving all of their doors open blasting narco corridos. It was the Zeta cartel. I remember being scared shit less and our dad told us to just stay quiet. I thought we were gonna take my brother since they would kidnap young guys and send them to work with them. And thought my dad was gonna have a gun pointed at him since he was the one behind the register. Some of the men waited outside with their m-16s and about 6 walked in with no noticable weapons and bought a bunch of chips, bread, beer, drinks, sodas, candy. I remember expecting for them to walk out with all of the stuff without paying but they paid for it all and let my dad keep the change. My brother and I then helped them put the bags in their trucks for some reason, and when we did we set them on top of their grenades, all types of rifles and pistols. Then they just got back in and drove off. Oh and there was a guard that worked there at some point and my bro and I were cool with him, and sometimes we would chill outside and the guard would mess with the payphones that were against the stores wall and pretend to flirt with the operator lady. Well one day he did that while some cartel members were there and they thought he was calling the people above him to tell them that the cartel was there, so they snatched him up and we never heard of him again."
"I worked in a private club at the top of a big hotel. I came in one day and our linens had just been delivered. And all of our linen bags reeked like gasoline. Everyone thought it was strange. It was kind of a slow night and I was working on the bar side. It has really long hallways. All night long I kept seeing flashes of a man out of the corner of my eye. When I was bringing dishes back to the kitchen it felt like someone was walking behind me. I thought I was just being paranoid, there were rumors of it being haunted and it wasn't the first time I saw something weird. After we closed I was setting up the bar for the next days lunch and my coworker came over to talk to me. He mentioned that he kept seeing a man out of the corner of his eye and felt like someone was standing behind him most of the night. I hadn't said anything to anyone about it until he brought it up. It freaked us both out so we worked together the rest of the night. Turns out that over the weekend the linen company we used had a truck flip and catch on fire and the driver got ejected and died. They brought us the bags and linens from his truck without having re washed them first. We found out the next day why the linen bags smelled. "
"The Summer before Senior year, I had the opportunity to go visit family in Austria. I went with my uncle and grandmother to go see them. I was 17 and a huge history buff, so I took a weekend borrowed one of the cars illegaly and drove 5 hours to Poland to visit Auschwitz to see the horror that took place there. Standing there at the entrance gate I felt the cold chill strike my core. I spent the whole time in silence, it was truly the most unsettling day in my life.

more recently, I went on a date where she wanted to explore an abandoned Asylum in VA, I noped the fuck out when she wanted to go to the operation theater., and the crematorium. I learned a lesson to never date a chick who claimed to have been one of the Salem Witch reborn.     "
"A friend of mine from high school and I were dating two sisters from another school we had met at a summer camp. They were driving to us to go on a date to see a musical in town. We had planned to meet at a local sandwich place to eat first.

I had driven both me and my friend there to save gas and we were waiting in the parking lot. The restaurant was in a strip mall that also included a popular sports bar. While we were waiting, a man walked out of the bar incredibly intoxicated. It was pretty clear that he was on something other than just alcohol. He stumbled around the parking lot and walked up to our car.

This guy pressed his face up against my driver's side window and started mumbling with a threatening look on his face. I couldn't hear a word he said, but we locked the doors so he couldn't get in. He then proceeded to do this...weird frustrated stumbling around the parking lot, lifting up his shirt and ranting. He went back and forth between my window and stumbling like this several times.

After a couple of minutes of this, my girlfriend called to ask for directions on where to go (this was before phone GPS). I'm giving her directions on where to meet us. All of a sudden, the guy points at the hood ornament on my car, freaks out, then rushes at the windshield and *bashes a crater into the glass with his bare goddamn hand.* I yelled ""Oh shit!"" into the phone and hung up, which scared the shit out of my girlfriend.

The guy's girlfriend drives up beside us, grabs the guy, and pushes him into their car before driving off. My friend got the license plates. Our girlfriends show up and we're a little dazed by it all. We call the police, they take our statement as well as some witnesses from inside the bar. Apparently, the guy had been kicked out for being too intoxicated and also having run out of money to pay for drinks. I had to call my mom because it was her car and we had no way of getting home after that. Luckily she was also in town to see the musical as well.

A week or so later the police contact us about the incident. Apparently, no charges would be pressed and they had to stop their investigation. The guy was a Native American living on a reservation, which is beyond the jurisdiction of police to investigate. To our knowledge, he faced no consequences and we had to pay to replace the windshield out of pocket."
"I have none that I can remember, but according to my mom, when I was a baby, I slept in a crib in her room. She snappednawake one day in the middle of the night to see a figure standing in front of my crib. She said it looked exactly like my great-great grandma who died only a few days after I was born. We were both in the same hospital at the same time. The figure turned and looked at my mom, smiled, and then vanished.

We don't know if it really was my great great grandma wanting to see me one last time, or if it was a demon wanting to hurt me, or an angel. My mom said she heard somewhere that angels will sometimes take the form of a deceased love one when visiting people."
"Psychosis, a delusion that I'm God and the only thing that exists."
"Late but:
When I was a kid, I lived in Uganda, Africa and there were a bunch of homeless people in the city(Kampala). At about 5 or 6 years old I would follow my mom out of the house whenever she would get ready to head to work at a research facility. (For context: in Uganda there are these little spots where guys on motorcycles gather as motorcycle taxis) My mother gets on a motorcycle taxi and leaves me there. This wasn't so bad as I lived just a short 3-5 minute walk away. This particular time, as I walked home a homeless looking dirty dude starts following me and I get scared and I start to jog home and he speed up and I break into a sprint. As soon as I started sprinting so did he and he chased me all the way back. My aunt was on the balcony of our house and saw me and yelled ""run""at me(or so I remember) and she sprints around back and opens the back door and I sprinted around the house and into the door. There were a bunch of doors to other buildings back there and he never saw the one I got into. What I can saw for sure is that I probably have never run so fast in my life and that the people in the apartment complex put together money for 2 guard dogs on the premises. Never knew why the dude chased me"
"Used to work in a psych unit...walked in on a guy who was writing bible quotes all over the wall in his own blood. He turned and looked at me with a feral, inhuman look i'll never forget that sent shivers up my spine... I saw true madness that day."
"I am an American engineer. I sometimes do field work and sometimes that involves traveling to poor countries.

Guy I worked with, local electrician. Was friendly. Spoke fluent English. Would always show me pictures of his daughter.

We hit the bar last night I am there sitting in back of a bar in Mexico. He tells me why he immigrated and about being an enforcer for the cartels and protection rackets in Haiti. Explaining why he could never go back.

I am listening to him confess and thinking the whole time about the number of ways he could have killed me and made it look like an accident the past ten days.

It really has changed the way I trust people when I am in the field now."
"I was watching Paranormal Activity 1 in my basement back in the day when it first came out and was considered scary. During one of the nights in the movie when the house is quiet and we're listening for creaks and objects moving, all of the lights in MY house go out. We lost power and I'm sitting in pitch black darkness. I nearly shit myself."
"This happened when I was maybe 7 or 8 years old.
My brother, who's one year my senior, suggested we go out to play since it wasn't as cold as the day before. It was fall I believe, partially because it was only five or six in the afternoon and it was already pitch black outside.
Anyways, we're running around in the dark, playing some game where we're ninjas and we have to hide besides a parked car in my driveway. 
Staying in character, my brother and I peer over the car to where we can see over the fence that separates our driveway from my neighbor's and a clearing in the sky where there weren't trees to obstruct our view. 
And that's when we see it.
The only way I can describe it is that it looked similar to the spacecrafts NASA uses to launch astronauts into space, except it was silver. Not only that, but it omitted this blue tint around it's entire body, like it was glowing or something.
I was so awestruck by this mysterious sight that I didn't take my eyes off of it for a second. 
The spacecraft itself stayed perfectly still in the sky, and for a moment I thought my mind was playing tricks on me, until it moved from one end of the clearing to the other in a millisecond.
When it moved, it left behind the same color blue trail in the sky from where it had previously been, and the light from the trail shined bright at first, until it slowly started to dull down. 
It moved faster than anything I had ever seen, and after it moved, it stayed perfectly still in the sky again.
My brother and I stood there, not saying a word.
It wasn't until this overwhelming fear struck me, and with shaking fingers, I grabbed on to my brother's sleeve and told him we should go inside.
To this day I still don't know what that was. I've looked into military planes and spacecrafts, but I've never seen a single one that looks anything like what I saw that day.
My brother still remembers, and despite the fact that we rarely bring it up, I know we're both still fascinated by what we saw that day."
"Alright, I was/am a crazy kid, and I kept on jabbing my hand in a mirror because I thought a mirror was a portal to another world and I was just blocking it.

I kept on trying to convince my 12 year old self to leave. And for one second, his mouth moved when mine didn't.

I think my mind was playing tricks, because it was 1 in the morning, but it still creeped the fuck out of me."
"I went to my college orientation, and they had a a ghost tour since our school was known to have some ghost stories on campus. I'm a fan of Supernatural, so I can kept joking that we should bring salt. We were in front of a fountain, I was surrounded by maybe over 30 people and the Orientation Leaders and two alums who run the tour. I was in the front of the group, listening to a girl talk about her experiences. All of a sudden, I feel someone pull me back, like grabbing my arms. I started to cough profusely and literally turned around and pushed my way out of all the students there and started to cry hysterically. During that day, my eyes were red, I had  seen an excessive amounts of pen markings on my foot and white sandals. I tried my best to clean the shoes when I discovered the markings. Fast forward to the following week, I go to my internship and I wear the sandals. I look down, and there's nothing there. There are no signs of pen markings and it looks brand new. To this day, I don't really understand what happened."
"I was babysitting my, at the time, five year old cousin. I was in middle school, we were watching some lame ass kids show, and he turns around and asks, ""Who is that?:
I turn to see that my window blankets are open, so I walk over to the window, look outside, and see zero things outside.
I asked him what it was he saw, and he responded that it was an old man and he was looking right at me. I noped all the way out of that room!"
"Feeling like my deceased great grandmother was leaning over me while I was in the dark in bed one night. It felt like she was an inch away from my cheek. Quite terrifying, as that was on the anniversary of her death. That was when I first moved into my brother's bedroom after he moved out. About a year ago it felt like my cat was walking on my bed the night after he died. A lot of weird, paranormal things happened to me in that room..."
"Coming back home from my deployment, I stayed at my parents house for a few weeks while my late grandmother, who was suffering from severe dementia stayed in the room adjacent from mine.  it was around 2AM when I'm awoken by a blood curdling shriek that lasted for what felt like an eternity, but must've actually been about 30 seconds in just one breath.  It turns out she was sleepwalking, tried to enter my room and slammed herself into the baby gate we had for my puppy.  I honestly don't know what was more terrifying, hearing that shriek suddenly in the dead of night, or flicking on the dim ceiling lights and seeing her stare at me, face was decrepit, mouth agape and her eyes wide as can be.  It makes my blood run cold every time I think about it."
"I was returning a lawnmower to my dad's warehouse (he was waiting outside) one night, and suddenly the lights went pitch black and an alarm started blaring.  Turns out I entered right before the security alarm system activated."
"In addition to my dead cat story, I was at a family restaurant when I was a kid, maybe 5 or 6. A little backstory, I grew up in a country where Asians were scarce.

I was eating and minding my own business while the grow ups talked. Then from around a corner, I see a huge camera pointing at me. I could hear the shutter go off as the guy took  pictures and a girl next to him giggled. Both looked about in their 20s. 
I tugged at my mom's arm but when she looked, the two people ducked out of sight. When coast was clear they started taking pictures again.

It's been 20 years now, and somewhere somebody has stalkerish pictures of me as a child and that's a very disturbing and unsettling thought. "
"Most unsettling, causing me to not sleep until I pass out from exhaustion? Watching the love of my life blow her brains out in front of me. I remember the texture, the taste of the mist in the air, the smell, everything. "
"Not me but my relative.

Moved into a new house, daughter started acting strange. Let's call that daughter Susie. When Susie played by herself, she would talk, claiming that she's playing with a girl but there was no girl. She also described the girl as tall and long haired. Her parents told her not to talk to that 'girl'. Days later, Susie tells her parents that the 'girl' kept pestering her when ignored 'her'. 

The family decided to move out the house shortly after. The most unsettling part was that the 'girl' wanted to follow Susie to the new house so they could play together. But everything was normal after they moved.

Fast forward a few years later when her uncle died, we had to put his urn in those cabinets at the cemetary. Guess who saw her uncle standing there while the urn was placed? No one saw it except Susie."
"I was about 12 or 13 years old. One time I'm walking to my psychiatrist for my weekly appointment. Its a half hour walk and after dark. I enjoyed walking, especially after dark when things were quiet, peaceful, and slow and no one else around. No, i didnt live in a dangerous neighborhood nor did my walk take me through any dangerous neighborhoods. 

As I'm about half way to my destination, a car, a cadillac, comes driving down the street. Some people, both male and female, in the car are sticking themselves half way out the windows and are taunting me and jeering me as they drive by. A bunch of people in their late teens or early 20s. I ignore them and keep on walking. About a minute or two later, the same car comes down the street again and those people are jeering me and taunting me again. I dont know who they are. Maybe they live in the neighborhood. I still ignore them and keep walking.

Another minute or so goes by and again they come driving down the street, taunting and jeering me. Now I'm worried. They're circling the block over and over, deliberately focusing on me

As soon as they reach the corner and make their turn and are out of sight, i duck behind some bushes in someones front yard and wait. The car comes again down the street. This time, not seeing me walking down the street, theyre not jeering. They pass right by me in my hiding place and turn the corner. I think they think I've finally reached my destination, one of the houses on the block, and went inside and as a result, drove away. I thought wrong. Stupidly i leave my hiding place and go back to walking on my way to my psychiatrist. I shouldve stayed there behind those bushes much longer because i hear the car approaching. They spot me and start taunting and jeering me again. They turn the corner. 

This time i run towards my destination but i know i wont get far before the car and those kids catch up with me again. So to that effect i decided to hide again behind the bushes in front of an apartment of an apartment building. This time resolving to stay there for good until the thugs in the car gives up their searching for me. I'm hiding there behind the bushes for not long. Maybe about 30 seconds or so when the guy whose apartment it is, pops out from his apartment, asking what I'm doing hiding in his bushes. At first he probably thinks I'm a burglar or something, but i explain to him how I'm walking to my psychiatrist and how I'm being followed and harassed by a bunch of kids in a car, which was why I'm hiding in his bushes. The guy can instantly tell from the tone of my voice and my facial expressions that I'm telling him the truth. He can see how scared I am.  

Just then the car comes down the street and pulls right up at the curb directly in front of us. They look at me and the guy I'm with. Not a mean looking guy (in his late 30s-early 40s), but tough and serious looking enough. He's not wearing a shirt. But he's wearing a sleeveless undershirt which reveals that this guys upper body is very well toned, slightly muscular, and no fat. 

I'm looking at the car and I realize that the car doesn't look so full now. It's missing a few people inside. The guy I'm with just gives them a mean stare. He asks me, ""You know them?"" I explain that no, I dont know them at all. I havent the slightest idea of who they are. 

Just then, as the car is sitting there, about 3 of them approach walking from the other direction. The car was traveling from east to west. Those 3 were walking on foot from west to east. So thats why the car seemed not so full. They were looking to escalate the situation. They werent satisfied with just driving by and taunting me, so they changed tactics. A few of them got out of the car up ahead and started walking towards me while the ones in the car took another turn around the block. Their plan now was to physically trap me in between themselves and their car. Perhaps grab me and drag me into the car with them for whatever reasons. But seeing my tough guy guardian angel with me, the kids walking towards the car instead got into the car and it took off. 

The guy offered to stay with me for a little longer or if i wanted to, to duck into his apartment to stay there until i was sure that it was safe to continue on my journey. I had a feeling that this  was the last I was going to see of those guys and their car and i didnt want to be late for my appointment. So i thanked the guy for his offer, but declined. And decided to head on my way. The guy went back into his apartment and closed the door. I looked at the closed door and hoped that I didnt make a mistake by turning down the guys offer of better safety, because I was still scared. Thankfully I was right about not seeing the car again. The rest of my walk I was unmolested. 

I reached my psychiatrists office. I told my therapist about what happened. He insisted on calling the police. The police came and took a report from me. Thats the last I heard of it. On my way back home, i usually took the same route that i came from, up the same streets. But this evening, i varied my way home, taking some different side streets to walk on. Never saw that car or those jerks again.

Here is, via google street search, the very spot I hid. That door was the guys apartment. That grassy area behind that low black metal fence on the left was where the bushes were that I hid behind. Back then the bushes in that spot were way tall, wide, and thick. Enough to hide a 12-13 year old kid behind. If I hadnt ducked behind those bushes, I would have walked right into their trap and God knows what they had in store for me once they had me trapped.

Is there a good subreddit for stories like this? I'm fascinated.
"I remember this so vividly. It was November 19th 1998. I got my gameboy colour earlier that week when  it was released and this was the first night I got to stay up play Pokemon yellow. 

It was past midnight for sure. I just got charmander and my pidgy was evolving. I was sitting in the living room on a couch wrapped up in a blanket. I noticed a car pulling up in front of my house, which wasn't too weird but I kept an eye on it. Three people get out, all of them seem large so I assume males. At this point it's suspicious, I was sitting in the dark so I could get the most out of my screen so I'm sure they never saw me through the bay window. My gut starts to hurt as I watch them walking too the side door. I move to the kitchen window and try to pick up what there saying but I couldn't make out anything. It was at this point I look out the window and I see one of them carrying a bat or something because of the street lamp in front of my house. At this point I am freaking. I was too scared to run to my parents room because I'd have to run past the side door which they're now at. 

I heard more talking then the door handle jiggles and turns but the deadbolt stops them. Which is funny because my parents almost never use the deadbolt...we've never had a reason to but my mother for some reason did that night. At this point I hear something that if I had to guess was 

""Aw, it's locked. Fuck"" Which now that I think about it. Does that mean they tried it before and it wasn't so they came back prepared? 

At this point they start to violently shaking the door. It seems so loud I thought it was going to wake everyone up. After a couple seconds they stop. I gather the courage to climb the counter to get a better look out the window. My face was inches away from the window when they came back through my drive way and passed me. I could see there faces but not well. So close. 

At this point they go back to the car and I move back to the front window to watch. Two of them get back in the car and one has the door open and about to get on when he looks back and makes a hand gesture and starts walking back to the front door which I'm right beside. Without even thinking I turn the deadbolt handle and the I move back into the closet the door faces. I see the handle move, it wasn't locked. I start thinking 'Oh my God, what if the deadbolt was already locked and I unlocked it' The guy gives the door a push and deadbolt stops him. I hear another frustrated sounds. He leaves and get back in the car and I hear it take off. 

So I watch the car leave my street and I relax. So what does my six year old mind think the next plan of action is? 

I go play more Pokemon until i pass out. I woke up and the fear hit me and the potential of what could of happened. I run to my parents bedroom to tell them but they sorta brush it off as if it was a dream. 

I felt like an idiot because no one believed me but I noticed after that night all the locks were locked from then on in my house. "

"I posted this earlier today:


I've had this recurring nightmare since I was 10 years old. Every once in a while I feel shaking in my body, mostly my arms, i'll be sweating, then i'll run to the closest mirror to me, in my reflection i'll see my face bleeding buckets from my forehead. Afterwards a hand will come out of the mirror and will choke me, the hand belongs to a naked woman. The woman will put her other hand on my chest, walk me back to my bed in the same position I was in, and then she'll sit on my body (particularly, the pelvic area), put her other hand on my throat, then finish strangling me to death. What the fuck man?! I have no explanation for this. 17 years later I still have this dream at least once a month."
the Chislehurst caves. Not a person who believes in ghosts or is into that shit normally but good god the pond/sinkhole/lake in there and some of the stories gave me nightmares and chills.
"I should start off by explaining that I have had incredibly vivid dreams (mostly nightmares) my entire life due to an overactive brain disorder; it just doesn't like to shut off ahaha. 

Due to this, I've had some very very strange experiences while falling asleep or just in a dark place. My brain, like most peoples will try to pick out figures in the dark, but mine has a tendency to amp things up a bit. 

One day at university I was sitting upright in bed, on my phone in the dark, gradually getting more sleepy. A figure appeared in my doorway that looked like he was made of old TV static. I've seen shit like this before so just know to ignore it, even as the figure walked towards my bed. I kept on looking at my phone and the figure was stood next to me now, out the corner of my vision. Now I always do this thing to prove to myself their not real as sometimes the hallucinations can be much more terrifying; I wave my hand through the figure to show there's nothing but air. This time however, my hand hit solid. There was someone standing there...

I freaked out. I'm not sure if I did or said anything, but my mind went into complete overdrive. There is something there that I can physically feel?! My natural fight or flight response is fight, so I was about to attack, and then I heard my housemates voice say ""you okay?"" ... I looked up and my housemate was stood there, which then freaked me out further. 

I couldn't work out what had gone one. In my tired state and dark room my brain must have picked out his outline, done it's usual playing tricks on itself but been unable to let go of the image it created. 

This genuinely terrified me, not because it was scary, but because it made me question how much I could trust my own brain! "
"The scariest for me was the time I found myself face to face with a freaking leopard. My family and I were visiting my grand parents over christmas in the countryside and I was 13. The toilet in the compound is a pit latrine that was set a little distance away from the main compound. So one night I wake up and have to pee. Its incredibly dark but I was used to it and had no fear. I had a flashlight with me. Anyway, I go to the toilet, pee, step out, and take a few steps. Suddenly I get this gut-wrenching feeling of terror. I stand completely still, just listening (I learnt early on that swishing the flashlight erratically is a good way to quickly raise your fear) and I don't hear shit. I turn slowly with the flashlight and right behind me is a leopard, and from its poise, it looked like it was just about to spring. Scariest event in my life. Even getting held up at a pharmacy wasn't that scary."
"The time I was mugged and attacked for kicks by a bunch of thugs on a subway train. 

This is rather long so please bear with me here.

 I was 13 years old in Brooklyn, NY. Just a week or two after my 13th birthday. A friend and I went to the movies about once a week. Normally we went to one of several movie theaters in his neighborhood. But there were times when the movie he wanted to see (he always picked the movie. I didnt care what he chose. I loved going to the movies regardless of what we went to see) wasn't playing in his neighborhood. So we would sometimes go to a theater outside his neighborhood. This particular time we had to go way out to Manhattan to see the movie (I have long since forgotten the title). We took a train out to Manhattan, saw the movie and took the train home. 

Because we lived in different neighborhoods, we had to get off at different stops. He got off his stop and I had to continue to the last stop so that I could catch a connecting train to take me home.

The subway car I was sitting in was completely empty. So was the car next to it (which was the first car of the train). After sitting there in the empty car, I do not know what possessed me, but I decided to move to another car instead of sitting there in the empty car. 

I got up and moved into the next car where there were people. I decided to move even further to another car again, but some leather jacketed guy got in my path and told me that the other train cars were closed. I knew this guy was full of it, but I didnt want any trouble from him. So I just said ""oh"" and turned around and went back into the empty car I came from and took my old seat. That guy and his friends took my response as a sign of weakness and cowardice, which it was. I was a meek little 13 year old put upon abused kid with no confidence whatsoever. 

I was sitting there in my seat when a metal dart landed on the floor at my feet. Followed by an angry, gruff voice yelling ""PICK IT UP!!!! PICK IT UP!!!!"". I looked over to my right and that leather jacketed guy and his friends (around a half dozen or so) poured into the car and came straight at me. 

His dart guy friend was one of the first to reach me as he ordered me to pick up the dart again. I did so and then he ordered me to hand it to him. I did. Then he proceeded to throw the dart directly into my legs over and over again. I screamed and cried. I put my hands over my legs in an effort to shield them, but then he ordered me to move my hands away or else. I did and he proceeded to throw his dart into my legs again as he stood over me.

My memory is a bit hazy as to how the rest progressed but I do recall them after the dart throwing they proceeded to use me as a punching bag. Fists flying into my face, chest, and stomach, not one of them at a time but several of them at the same time. 

I managed to break free of these guys and made a run for the car door so that I could escape into the next car where there are people. But one of them was guarding the door. This guy was not taking part in my torture with his friends. He just stood at the door as lookout. I could sense that this guy had some compassion for me. That he felt some sort of guilt about what was going on. Which was why he wasnt taking part that i can recall. But as I reached the door, he still prevented my escape. I yelled, I screamed, I cried, I begged him to let me go. But he wouldn't. He threw me back to his friends. That guy, keeping me trapped in that car with his friends that very second, was the worst feeling ever. 

Somewhere along the line I found myself on my knees on the floor of the subway car. I reached into my pocket and pulled out all the money I had on me at the time. All the money i had in the world. A single dime. I held it out to them in the palm of my hand above my head and yelled at them that was all I had. Please take it and leave me alone. I felt a leather gloved hand press into my palm and take the dime. But they still werent finished with me. 

One of them got the bright idea that he wanted to see my head go crashing through one of the windows of the subway car. So they grabbed me, and actually started to ram me head first into the glass of one of the windows. Fortunately subway car windows are strong and shatterproof.  They had to be due to all the vibrations it takes from a moving train. I cant recall how many times they rammed my head into the glass. Somewhere from a half dozen to a dozen before they gave up.

Just before we reached the last stop I was on my feet. I opened my mouth to say something (cant recall what it was), and accidentally a little spittle came flying out of my mouth and landed on the leather glove of one of my attackers which earned me a slap in the face. 

Finally we reached the last stop. The doors opened and they ran out of the car except for one guy who I assume was their leader. The same guy who at the beginning got in my path and told me the other train cars were closed. He reached into his pocket, pulled out his wallet and asked me if I needed a couple of bucks. I couldnt believe it. I didnt want anything from him. I refused his offer and he put his wallet back and walked off the train.

I went to the front car to report to the conductor that I was attacked. I banged on the door. But there was no one there. I walked off the train onto the platform. I changed platforms. I saw a couple of cops with their backs to me. They were exiting the platform by going down the stairs. I called out to them but they didnt hear me. I was too weak from the beatings to go run after them. They disappeared out of my sight. It was just as well. I never memorized my attackers faces as I tried not to make eye contact with them throughout the entire ordeal. I had forgotten what they looked like within seconds of them leaving the train. I would never be able to give an exact, positive description. And I never knew their names, nor they mine. 

Defeated, I caught my connecting train. This time finding and staying in a car that was reasonably filled with normal looking people. Second I got home, I flopped into bed to go to sleep. When I woke up the next morning, my body ached all over.

I imagine my attackers, if they're still alive today, are somewhere in their 50s (at the time of their attack on me, they were all a few years older than me. I estimate late teens to early 20s). Some of them no doubt have families of their own today. Wives, grown kids, homes, good jobs, etc. 

But I'll also bet they keep it a secret from everyone in their inner circles (employers, co workers, friends, family), about the time how they mugged and physically assaulted some young kid, a total stranger, for kicks on a subway train way back when. Their friends and families, wives and kids, probably look up to them, thinking theyre the greatest, not knowing what lowlifes they really are and were. 

My life at the time and the many years following were terrible and painful for many reasons. Granted theyre not to blame for the entire terrible state that was and is my rotten life. To be fair, had i never encountered them, my whole life would still be terrible. But they sure did contribute to the lousy horibleness that is my life. I have never forgotten or forgiven them for the torture they inflicted on me both physically and mentally. I hope they all burn in hell.

TL; DR: The time i was attacked and mugged for kicks on a subway train

"2 things at the same place. I ride horses and both happened at the barn I was training at. 

When I was younger I would work at the barn to pay off extra rides. I was leading a horse out of the barn at night and all of a sudden the radio in the barn just turned on full volume. I freak out and sprint to the field with the horse on the line let him loose and tell my mom what happened. She doesn't believe me so we both walk in and the radio was still on but turned down really low. It was terrifying and would never be in the barn that late alone again. 

The second time was when I was a bit older and was riding in the indoor ring. The far side of it was completely open and was just dark (again at night during the winter). I knew my dad was coming so I was looking out for him. As I was at the opposite end of the ring from the opening I saw a man walk by from right to left wearing jeans and a black shirt, something my dad would wear for work, and then he disappeared to the other side. So I hurry over to him to say hi and there's no one there. I called out a few times but nothing. I look outside and there's no truck that he would have driven. 

The barn has been known to be haunted but never believed any of it until those two things happened "
"Around the time my wife and I started dating I was living in an apartment building with a few friends and I started experiencing sleep paralysis. I would ""wake up"" and feel dozens of unbelievably strong hands pinning me to my bed followed by excruciating stabbing sensations around my lower rib cage. The whole time I wouldn't be able to see anyone, but I could hear them cackling. It always started with a slow knocking from the closet door. It was pretty horrifying. My roommate also said there was times where he would wake up and hear a faint screaming echoing from the crack at the front of his bed. We later found out that the apartment building had been a not so reputable old peoples home in the past."
"There's a room across from me that's too dark than it should be. Everytime I take a minute to glance into it's surroundings on occasions, I notice this. Some nights, it'll be normal blackness but still visible things you can make out if light hits it. But there are some nights where it's darker than normal, like pitch black."
"I have to preface this by being a bit rude to the other stories here. I don't believe in anything ghostly or paranormal and that kind of stuff doesn't scare me and I find it a bit boring actually. This is because I used to be HEAVY into the paranormal as a young teenager. 

I went through this phase during high school of being absolutely convinced a ghost was haunting my apartment. This is because my bed would shake ever so slightly, as if someone was shaking the end of the mattress to get my attention. Every time I would try to kind of 'zero in' on the feeling of the bed shaking to confirm its existence, it would stop. So I was in this constant state of feeling like something spooky was happening to me, but never getting enough proof to confirm whether I was imagining it or not.

One day, I was lying on my belly on my bed and I felt it begin to shake. I 'zeroed in on it' and... holy hell, it was real. And the shaking was increasing exponentially. Undeniable. The bed was shaking. It was broad daylight. Ghost confirmed.

I jumped up. My hand flew to my hair. Fear pulsated in my throat. Then I noticed that the floor was shaking as well... The fear mutated tenfold. 

The phone rang. My mom approached me, held out the phone to me. I could only stare at her, dumbfounded. Didn't she feel all the tremors? Didn't she feel the entire apartment trembling?

I grabbed the phone. It was my math teacher, telling me I failed Grade 11 math class with a 45. I felt like I was in a dream. Ghost confirmed. Existence is shaking. My mom is acting like nothing is happening and my fucking math teacher is calling me on the phone in the middle of it? I exited that conversation as fast as I could but by then the trembling had stopped and reality returned to ""normal.""

Well, [it was the 2010 central Canada earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Central_Canada_earthquake). Some time after that, I was sitting on my bed and realized that the shaking I had felt prior to the earthquake, the one that had instigated my obsession with ghosts... Well, it was my own heartbeat, shaking my body, if in a certain position, just enough that I could feel the slightest tremble.

Case closed. Ghost busted. 

Also, my mom never mentioned it because she never noticed apparently? And yes, I spent the duration of an earthquake talking to my math teacher about how much of a failure I was."
"I will always remember this one particular evening sleeping at my Grandparent's house (I now live in this house and I am a adult attending college). Bare with me, this is my first posting on reddit and a long one at that! I have more stories like this one involving this house in my childhood but this one is the worst.

I remember when I spent time with my Grandmother being exposed to her spiritual ideologies, she could sense spirits and believed in the sixth sense. Being raised Catholic I thought this was interesting and as a child I was always would see if I could contact spirits through meditation and listening; the way the house makes noise, if I feel anything emotionally or physically, if my dog gets up and makes noise... things like that. Needless to say, I had many night terrors and would wake up screaming.

At the time my Grandparent's had lived in this house for no more than a few years, I was in elementary school at the time. before my Grandparents purchased the house and settled in, the home belonged to a single owner, whom of which was a carpenter and built the house for himself and his wife named Corky. She was indeed corky, leaving behind a completely pink bathroom from ceiling to tiles.

Anyways, both of them lived happily in our new home until the husband died by heart attack in the doorway of the living room bathroom. A short year after, the wife had died and decomposed for a week or so in her rocking chair near the fireplace not 30 feet away from where her husband passed away. For multiple years nobody was interested in the home. 

For some reason, my Grandmother says that she was called to this home because she had a vision of a home, and this was the home inside that vision. She explained to me that she knew the layout of the home down to the objects and decorations and could sense where the husband and wife had passed... without previously seeing many pictures and knowing about the deaths. The seller of the house was shocked that my Grandmother knew, my Grandfather was oblivious to it all as well. 
The only thing I knew was that it was the house next to an old Cali mission that was destroyed by an earthquake in the 1700's, which wiped out many of the natives and missionaries who lived there. Our house was built on top of the mission grounds.

One night it was a pretty stormy evening; dry lightning storm and I could not sleep. I wish I was joking but it really was odd, I am not setting this up like some fromage induced ""One stormy evening"" tale from a cheap horror book. I felt really odd in that particular evening because of the sweats I had, the dogs in the house running around and barking, my sleepless Grandparents. I overheard my Grandmother talking to my Grandfather and said she could not sleep and that it was ""busy"" tonight. After that I got up to go to the bathroom and on my way back from squeezing the lemon I got shivers and goosebumps entering the doorway of my room. I yelled for my Grandmother and she came into my room and climbed into bed with me, comforting me. I remember at this point being terrified, burying myself into her side. 

It was at this point I felt like someone was watching me or like someone other than my Gran was in the room. I peek my eye open and sure enough at the corner of the bed I see the blur of a man resembling my Grandfather but taller with a white shirt tucked into his jeans at the corner of my bed. It was like being socked in the face with terror. I then am paralyzed with fear but am able to tell my Grandmother that there is a man at the edge of the bed. I will always remember what she told me afterwards lovingly: ""Shhh it's okay I know."" I stayed in the same position for the entirety of the night paralyzed by fear.

I sleep in the same room now as I did back then, only with the bed switched to the opposite side of the room."
"Forgive me for a lackluster answer, but this is all I've got.

Back when I was about 9, I had a family member get pretty ill. He was bedbound and we didn't know if he was going to make it. I kissed him before I left, but the thing was he had a moustache. That prickly feeling you feel if you kiss a guy with a stache? 9 year old me remembered that feeling from somewhere before then. I didn't remember where I felt it or when, but now that I'm older it's much more unsettling to think that maybe someone did something to me but I found ways to shut it out and away from my life. Enough to totally forget about it.

I get conflicted feelings of anger and apprehensiveness when I think about it to this day."
"I was laying in bed looking at my shadow on the ceiling and moving my arms around making different poses when the shadow stopped moving and scurried to the corner, scared me to the point of chest pains, I was like 13."
"After a party, my GF and I went and parked on a rural road. Its after 2am, and there are no houses around and no other cars.

We're in the backseat, doing what you expect in the backseat, the windows are fogged and the only light is coming from the car stereo. I looked up, and was checking out the fogged window, and that's when I noticed the darker outline of head & shoulders just on the other side. 

I was instantly terrified, probably screamed ""Fuuuuuck!"" Looked at her, looked back up trying to explain that there was someone outside the car, I wiped the fog off the window, and the guy was just slowly walking backwards to the far side of the road. I have no flashlight, no weapon, just a naked girl, a Pinto, and a car stereo. I hop into the driver seat, fire up the car, because this is the part of the movie where the window is broken and the stabbing begins. But I'm not going to let that happen, I'm going to be the guy that just drives the fuck away.

The girl keeps yelling, ""what's going on? what's going on?"" I keep yelling, that there was a person looking in at us.

Just the way the guy slooooowly walked backwards into the woods. I'm trying to get the car to turn over, and I keep looking out the window, and he just dissolved into the trees."
"The other night, my friends and I were buzzed and were wandering around a few blocks. We thought we heard firecrackers down the street a few blocks away. Found out after we got back home that someone had been shot around that area at the same time we were near there.

On the upside, the dude was shot in the buttocks and the first comment on the news article was ""Lieutenant Dan, Ice Cream!!"""
"Dream-related, but not paranormal.

When I was 14 or so, I had a dream that I was the main character from a game like Wolfenstein 3D or Doom or somesuch. Not a specific one, just generic FPS protag. I had a bomb, and I couldn't disarm it, and I needed to throw it somewhere far from me -- but I was inside a building where I couldn't throw it very far because of walls. The walls were all closer than the blast radius. I needed to throw it outside the building. I scrambled to get to a window, and threw it out at great force, and then realized there was another building just a few yards away, and the bomb hit the other building so didn't fly very far away at all, and exploded with me in the blast radius, and I woke up.

My heart was pounding so fast when I woke up that it was painful, and I thought ""this must be a heart attack. I must be having a heart attack right now."" I thought ""oh no, the 'if you die in a dream you die in real life' thing is real!"" I think that's the only time in my life that I literally thought I was in the process of dying. 

Thankfully (?) I was too freaked out to call for help, and it calmed itself down as I lay in bed for a few minutes. I've had other nightmares but I think I've never had anything else quite like that experience."
"I was hunting elk in Colorado several years ago; grumbling about how cold it was as I was marching to the road to be picked up by my father as dusk creeped in and fresh snow drifted down from the sky. As I was trudging away I felt the hairs on the nape of my neck stand on end, did a quick about-face and saw nothing, and proceeded to walk a little more briskly down the trail while gazing over my shoulder now and then. 

I still couldn't shake that damn feeling, and as I walked down the road I crossed a set of what I could only assume to be mountain lion tracks. I'm familiar with bobcat, they're plentiful in my home state and these were much too big. As I'm walking it dawns on me that with the fresh snowfall these tracks must be fresh as well. They zigzagged off into the tree line and back onto the trail my entire walk out. Never saw it, didn't want to, and was quite happy when I got back to my bunk in the cabin that night.  

"
I had a sleep paralysis episode of getting dragged out of my bed by aliens and woke up where I was dragged off my bed.
"Here's something a little different than the paranormal/creepy shit going on here, but it certainly fits the topic.

When I was a young boy, about 6 years old, my parents had decided to finally let me stop sitting in the seat of the cart at the store and follow behind them. I was a well-behaved child, I never touched anything, I never screamed when I didn't get what I wanted, and my parents could trust me to always be close behind them.

As a reward for good behavior, my parents would often set me loose for a few minutes in the toy aisle to look at LEGO sets, and if I was particularly lucky I'd get to buy one.

So there I was at K-Mart, holding the box to Jango Fett's Slave I in my hands, thinking of all the ways I could convince my parents to buy it for me. It really was a nice set, and the colorful boxart had almost mesmerized my young brain. But alas, my time was up, and my father called ""Sleepless, it's time to go,"" from down the aisle.

I put the box down and walked around the corner. I saw my mom and dad (both around the age of 30-40 at the time) and followed behind them for quite a while, like the good child I was. I looked around the aisles a bit, but I wouldn't say I was THAT easily distracted.

Yet, somehow, when I looked at my father again, it hit me that this man wasn't my father. I was following an elderly couple, a man with a cane, a woman with gray hair, both in nice outfits, likely fresh from church, people who looked NOTHING like my parents.

I could have sworn I was following my dad the whole time, but I ended up walking across half the store to find my parents. It was the most bizarre experience of my life, I couldn't fathom how I thought they were my parents or when the mix-up happened.

**tl;dr:** Started following my mom and dad, took me 10 minutes to realize they were total strangers and my parents were on the other side of the store looking for me."
My mother who was a professionally trained singer have night terrors one night. Dear god the most inhuman terrifying noise of my entire life.
The 2016 American Presidential election.  Jeezus...
"I have semi-regular hallucinations... mostly audible, sometimes visual, and on a few occasions tactile. They usually, but not always, happen with sleep paralysis.

The worst by far happened when I was in bed one night. Top bunk out of two, facing the door. The door starts to open (notably nothing like that has *ever* happened, before or since. Things appear and they might interact with me, but *never* the general environment). 

I just *know* something is coming in, but out of sight, well below where I can see from the top bunk. Crawling on all fours. I saw it in my head, vaguely. I started to hear its movements too, but being paralysed I couldn't move.

Then it starts climbing the little ladder onto the bed, and it jumps right on and grabs at me. Suddenly I'm moving and struggling with it, kicking it away while it pulls at me.

Then I kind of ""snap back"" (like a jump cut in a movie) to lying face up on my bed not having moved at all, but no longer paralysed"
"A few months before my niece turned 3, I was outside with her on the trampoline. She was laughing and jumping when she suddenly turned her attention to the back porch. She stopped jumping, pointed and said, ""stand up little boy"". I asked her what she was talking about and she pointed again, ""the little boy, he's laying on the stairs""

It was unsettling, but not terrifying or anything. She seemed worried about the little boy, but she was very casual about it."
"When I was 14, my family visited Atlanta for the summer Olympic games of 1996. We saw a few events in the daytime and headed over to Centennial Olympic Park to watch a few bands play in the evening. It was a really cool, fair-like atmosphere packed with people having a good time.

Despite the fun we were having, I suddenly got really fussy and anxious, to the point where I was nagging my parents to leave. It was really out of character for me because I was generally a go-with-the-flow kid, and a bit old to be acting that way. To my surprise, my parents, who were strict no-nonsense types, acquiesced to my demands and we left. 

When we got back to the relative's house where we were staying, there were reports that Olympic Centennial Park (where we just were) was bombed. My mother started crying, sure that I had some 6th sense, and I was just stunned.
"
When I was younger (about 9-10) I was asleep in my own room at my grandmas cottage in the middle of nowhere. No neighbours for miles and super secluded. I awoke in the middle of the night to sounds of a baby crying and yelling help me help or something like that in this incredibly eerie voice. I'll never forget sitting in the darkness with my eyes opening listening to the wailing right beneath my window. I ended up getting my grandpa to sleep in the room instead and he never heard a thing.
"One time I was dog sitting for a coworker for a little over a week and sleeping on her couch. The second or third day there after getting back from work I smelled a faint ammonia type smell. I thought the dog may have peed somewhere. It I couldn't find it. I tried changing the trash bags, cleaning, checking for rancid food, and I came up with nothing. I was hoping it would maybe just go away or that her house just smelled funny. 

Over the next 3-4 days it kept getting stronger. I even had a friend look around with me. Still nothing. I didn't want to call my coworker because I didn't want them to be concerned. If it didn't go away by the day before they came back then I would have told them. 

Well almost a week had gone by and I had started to ignore it. Each night I would have a couple beers, maybe watch tv or play with the dog, but I was regularly using the kitchen door to smoke outside. Well when I came back in one time I just happened to be standing in the kitchen when I realized that the smell was due to the fact the the fucking gas had been on her stove for the past fucking week.

I had been lighting up RIGHT outside the door, multiple times a night, for a whole week, while her stove is turning her house into a BOMB. My heart has never jumped so badly in my life. I immediately opened all the windows and turned every fan in the house on and left with the dog for a while. I remembered that here had been an old pizza box on the stove that I threw out earlier in the week when I was trying to figure out the smell. I think her dog climbed onto the oven and turned the gas on.

I don't think I have ever been so close to suffering such a catastrophe in my entire life. "
"I was around 17 or so when this happened. 
I had a habit of walking back and forth from one end of the room to another, while reading. 

One day around 9 pm, I was walking in my room reading, when I reach the edge of my room with a window on it and very randomly pull the curtains back, leaning in towards the window to look out at the same time. 

There was a man standing on the other side of the window, cupping his hands on the glass and looking in. For a moment, we were face to face, with about 2 inches of distance between our faces. His face was very pale(or so I imagined in the darkness) and bearded. I fell back with a shout, tripped over a chair and ended up sprawled on the floor. I shouted for my dad and we raced to the door and reached the spot outside the window, to find nothing but some deep footprints in the flowerbeds. "
"After my dad died, we had an islamic burial the next day.
They prepared his body for the crypt and we were moving his body to the grave site.

Well, we don't use caskets, just wrap in some sort of cloth, idk.
So he was just in some cardboard box with some prayer sheets on it.
Well, as we were going there, the hearse driver kept hitting his breaks and my fathers dead body kept slamming into my back."
I once had a run in with the infamous hash slinging slasher. I was so scared I decided to stop working the night shift. 
"I was driving in the middle of nowhere in northern Ontario, on a 2 lane highway lined with trees. It's around 2 in the morning, and it's total darkness except for the headlights. The road was really long and straight, and at first I thought I saw a motorcycle way off in the distance behind me. It looked like one headlight, but when it got closer it didn't bounce right if that makes sense. It just looked off. 

The thing that startled me most was how fast it closed on me. I felt the wind pull on my car as it shot past me on the left - an old beat up pickup truck. I didn't get a good look at it, but it had round headlights, one was smashed out or missing and the other was bouncing around loose. 

I know it might sound lame but the combination of how it looked, how ***ing fast it was going, and the terrible shrieking it was making. Whoever it was, was going as fast as they could go, even though it sounded like it was going to blow up at any moment, and they barely had any forward lighting. Creeped the shit out of me. I actually turned off somewhere and shut the car off and hid in case they were running from someone. "
"My boyfriend was out of town so I was home alone for a few nights. I was just starting to fall asleep when my cat shrieked from another room (a sound I've only ever heard her make when her tail got pinched in a drawer once). I jolt awake and lay there quietly, imagining all the terrible things that could be in my house at that moment. As I was watching the door it slowly drifted open, the reason why this was so scary for me is because the door actually needed a bit of force to open because of the carpet. No one was there, no open windows in the house, no cat (not that I think the cat could have pushed it open anyway). I can still remember the pure terror I felt when that happened."
"September 11, 2001.  I live in western Canada, a couple thousand miles away from New York but that was one of the most fucked-up days I've ever lived.  To see the United States - a country, which on the world stage is the equivalent of your school's six-foot-two, muscular, blonde-haired all-star quarterback - have its nose bloodied so savagely was eerie.  When I shut my TV off that day and went to bed, I knew that if people could do that to America on American soil, no one anywhere could be sure they were safe."
"I got my first real office job with a small 5-person office in Virginia on the ground floor of a commercial condominium building. My first week, I was at a desk toward the front of the office next to the front door and within eyeshot of the rear door. On this particular day, it was only me and the accountant in. As I sat typing, i could hear the front door unlatch and it opened roughly 90°. Puzzled, I looked around then back at the door. ""Hello?"" I said. The door immediately slammed shut with vigor. Without hesitation, I leapt out of my chair and went to the accountants office, ""did you open a door or anything just now?"" ""What you mean? No, I've just been here."" 

Our office is at the end of a long mostly un-rented hallway. I checked with the office next to ours (being the only other occupied unit) and they said nobody had come in or out of their office in over 30 minutes. Because this long abandoned hallway leads to a very large foyeur with automated sliding doors (not hinge-bound), I cannot figure a way that an air pressure difference would have pushed or subsequently pulled the door.

The weirdest part wasn't until a week later when I was cleaning out the front desk to relocate to my predecessors office when I came across a name placard. The name was B. Gordon. He was the original owner of the building when it was built in the 1960's and died in (his) private jet crash back in the mid-80's. His grandson was my [then] current employer. I never believed in ghosts or the paranormal until then. True story."
"I don't believe in the supernatural and I'm not religious, but this one still baffles me. When I was young my friends wanted to play a ouji type game. We didn't have a board so we used a snowglobe. (Idfk, they thought it was a median to manifest energy) Even though I don't believe in it,  I became uncomfortable when they started this little made up chant to summon something from hell. After that, the girls started acting out trying to scare each other.  It was very obvious when somebody was trying to scare the other, and I was rolling my eyes the whole time. Finally I picked up the snowglobe and put it back on my friend's  wooden stand with her other collectables. My friends wanted to play one last game, where you hide in the closet and say a chant and then they hold the door close while you try to get out.  It was a dumb way to get thrills but they all mutually enjoyed it. There is no lock on the closet door and you have to push it open from the inside to get out.  They played this game very often and this was not the first time. I never played along because it always seemed silly to me.  Well this time,  two girls go into the closet,  and the other three of us remain outside. They do their chant and before they finish start screaming.  And I mean,  real screaming.  Both are banging on the door and begging us to let them out.  We freak out and try to open the door but it's jammed.  The knob won't turn and for the first time we are legitimately freaked out and trying to help them out.  Finally the door gives and swings open.  One of them who had been pulling on the knob and flung back from the sudden give and knocked against the wooden stand i mentioned earlier.  Only three items fell off the stand.  They were two crosses and a praying hands figurine.  One cross broke  (ceramic material) everything else on the stand was in place. We just kind of froze and I had a sick feeling in my stomach.  After that we did a circle prayer and promised to never do anything like that again. It really could be a coincidence for the door knob to jam and for those items to fall off the stand,  but regardless it was too creepy to chance."
When I was around 5-9 there were a few times when I walked into my house and had something thrown at me. I know it happened more than once but can't remember how many times. Can't be more than three times. I never told anyone because I didn't know how to explain it. I would just be creeped out and waited on my front porch until my mom got home. 
"A week or so ago I was laying in bed. It was around 3 at night and I was half asleep. Anyways, during that time I heard a loud *CLAP* in my room that scared the bejesus out of me, I thought something fell,but no my mouse trap caught a rat. Ever since then I'm always afraid that it might happen again."
"Hanging out at a girls house who always believed in the occult but I always told her it was bullshit.. As I would to this day.. As I am straight as and don't believe in any crap.. 
  But late one night as I was trying to get into her knickers she was rocking back and forth and saying 'don't be the phone don't be the phone' and all of a sudden the phone rang... She looked at me with a deathly stare and yelled ""I told you I told you!!""

I still don't believe but holy fuck I saw it with my own eyes"
I saw a goat get killed.
"A couple years ago, I was out at a bar with some friends and it was one of those chill nights that tapered off into nothing. My friend and I call it a night and he drives me home. At that time the alcohol was most definitely worn off as we drank slowly and nothing ever happened. For some weird reason my buddy missed the regular exit on the way home, so we take the next exit that crosses into a neighborhood that sits opposite from mine. As we are crossing through the neighborhood, I remember a lot of my childhood and I'm thinking about old friends. We are passing an old graveyard and there's a loop around. As we come around the corner, I yell at my friend to stop because I see a woman crossing the street. He freaks out and comes to a crashing halt. He never saw the woman. I look closer and there's no one there. In my mind, I for sure saw a woman trying to cross the street and into the graveyard. He jokingly says, ""looks like you saw your first ghost."" I laughed it off and said maybe it was just me being tired.

Anyways the next day my friend calls me and I was in the middle of writing a paper so I let it ring. I then get a text asking if I heard about an old friend. I said no?? What's going on?? Apparently, an old friend who used to live in the same neighborhood about a block from that graveyard was found dead that same morning. I don't know if it has anything to do with me seeing that lady, but the same kid was buried in that graveyard close to where I saw her trying to cross the street (same direction). My friend was a male, but it still creeps us both out.

"Grew up in a haunted house. Not really haunted so much as demonic. A never ending poltergeist hell. Moved in as a happy family when i was about 9. Started off with your normal innocent cupboards opening, whispers in the other room, toys never where you left them. Then it changed. My father became increasingly moodier. My mom doing everything she can to not be at home with -him- us. Quickly... divorce. Mom took sex, drugs, and alcohol extremely seriously after this and came home less than a handful of times a month. I'm the only one left at home now. Alone. Well except I had my best friend. Best dog ever to have graced this planet. Had to watch him get flung about our house like a ragdoll so hard he broke through the drywall on a few occasions. Recliner would turn itself upside down and throw itself across the living room towards my bedroom door if i dare left it open accidentally at night. Crosses on the wall would always be swinging upside down when I walked in the front door. No matter how many nails i used to keep it upright, they'd all be in a pile on the floor within the hour. Unplugged TVs and radios would randomly turn on to static so you wouldn't forget to ""get out"" if you needed to hear it verbally, he has it covered.  The feeling of being groped and molested at every shower and bedtime. Became very insomniac and agoraphobic. Felt so bad for my dog being home alone with whatever that thing was that I couldn't do more but go to school and immediately come right back home. 14 and never been to a friend's house before. And then one day I come home to the most beautifullest FORECLOSURE sign on my front door. I no longer have to live here. We get moved into the new place and I'm still having a terrible time getting my insomnia under control. I'm on day 6 of absolutely not one minute of even a cat nap. Its 2ish in the morning. I'm cleaning the kitchen. Doing dishes. Look up to see my elderly neighbor looking directly at me from inside her house with the most terrified looked on her face. I'm tired. Cant register whats happening at the time. My side door directly behind the sink I'm washing up at opens and I'm watching my neighbor get hysterical as I ask my mom's boyfriend how poker night went without turning around. I move my eyes over the glass to see him in the reflection behind me. So weird. Why is he wearing a ski mask on in the dead of summer? Move my eyes to my neighbor again thats still watching me, sobbing. Then I see a man in the bottom right corner of the window. Telling the man next to him he can see both of us and ""she's home alone, he won't chicken out again"". Still not sure whats going on. I've been up for 6 days. I can feel him breathing on my neck. Sniffing my hair. See him realizing from the reflection of watching him in the window that the neighbor is watching this. Hearing him turn around and walk out as quietly as he came in. Watching him pull up his pants as he runs off into the dark with his friends. Now its registering. Holy shit. I'm never sleeping again. Over 10 years later and I still dont. Safe to say i have a few hang ups and social/mental issues. "
This happened last week. We were on holiday with friends. We all went out to bars and clubs etc except for a couple within our group. Once we were at a bar my friend called from the hotel and told me and another friend to come because his girlfriend started talking to spirits. We arrived and found her in a kinda trance. In started talking to her and fortunately she acted normal from then on.
When I was kidnapped.
that time my stash of wigs and womens clothes mysteriously vanished.
"Night terrors always got me as a kid. I remember one time when I was about 8, me and my family took a trip to Bibione. It was a pretty small hotel room with two beds, I slept in one with my sister who was probably nine at the time and my parents slept in the other one. I remember some parts, mostly me crying intensely and just screaming. My mom tells me the story sometimes and she says she vividly remembers me saying ""help me mom, help me"" as I was in my dad's arms as he tried to calm me down. Funny thing is my sister slept through the whole entire ordeal somehow"
"One that comes to mind ,  summer 2012 when my aunt was still alive me and her were talking on her  back porch at about 2 am, I lived there for the summer and her son was away for the week so I was awake, bored, lonely and sober. 
So I talk to her about her old job at a mental institution and she said that the patients would always request to have the doors left open because they wanted the hallway light to be within reach. 
While she is telling me this story for some reason I decided to look up and I see on the second story is her 3 year old daughter just staring out the window, with her height there should've been no way that I would've seen her, it was almost like her body was elongated . We rush upstairs and she's still standing in front of the window, holding a pair of scissors. 
Staring at the wall underneath the window. 
My aunt creeps over to her daughter and picks her up  and she snaps out of it "" why are you picking me up mommy"". 
I nope my way to the back porch for a cigarette. 

This is one of a few that come to mind. "
"Ok....im new to Reddit so forgive me if I'm not posting this in the correct place or the correct way. I just need to get this out. And after watching true reddit stories on youtube i figured this is the place. So here goes.....i was cruising around youtube and i came across these scp videos. I forget what the letters stand for but it's basically a agency that captures a variety of different monsters, creatures and supernatural beings. Idk if these things are real but the whole idea interested and fascinated me. Soon enough i was semi addicted to watching the vids and would always watch a few whenever i had spare time. After awhile i began feeling increasingly paranoid and fearful. Now ive always been interested in the paranormal. Ghost stories etc....so i know that creepy paranoid scary feeling well and this was very different. I didn't necessary feel afraid that anything was coming to get me but i just felt really paranoid, uncomfortable and unsettled It got so intense i almost couldnt take it. I was afraid to watch the vids because of this but i still would anyway. So one day im relaxing in my room watching scp vids of course. And that overwhelming feeling of paranoia starts. But, this time its accompanied by a burning sensation around my face and neck. I start to get scared. As im paralysed by fear i begin to pray for protection feverishly. The burning increases. I pray more and slowly it begins to fade. I sat still on my bed for a minute afraid to move. I Then got up and walked out towards the living room. As i made my way down the hall i noticed a circular burn mark in the wooden floor next to the couch. It was not there before. I haven't watched a video since. Idk what happened to me but I'm thankful to god he heard my prayers. Has anything like this happened to anyone else?

"Woke up from a dream with sleep paralysis still. I panicked for a while trying to move while staring at the door to my small room. The house was dead silent and all I could see was some weird dark shape in the doorway while I couldn't move. After a couple minutes I immediately shot up in bed completely drenched in sweat and frantically reached for the light switch.

Needless to say I was up at that point but the whole time I just had this incredibly overwhelming sense of fear and paranoia from the point I first woke up to the point the sun came up."
"I used to get a lot of lucid nightmares and sleep paralysis. But sometimes they felt so real that even I started to get the creeps. One incident is back when I was in high school and went to bed. As I'm sleeping, I had this feeling of 'waking up' (surprise motherfucker, it's sleep paralysis!) but this time it felt different. Something was wrong. The first thing I noticed that something was terribly wrong was when I started to hear a bunch of flies buzzing around my ear, although I could not see any hovering flies around anywhere near my vicinity. Then slowly a figure started to emerge at the foot of my bed.

As it started to take shape, it formed into this fucked up, broken, porcelain baby doll with a cracked face lined up with multiple miscellaneous baby doll body parts like a centipede and was sitting upwards. The sound of flies buzzing intensified as I caught sight of it within my peripheral vision. It just stood there. I couldn't take it anymore, but couldn't move or scream until I truly woke up and everything was back to normal. 

I've had several other disturbing 'dreams' and incidents while I lived in that apartment complex. Strangely enough, as soon as I moved out of that place, I stopped having nightmares and sleep paralysis, along with some of the unexplained but undoubtedly 'minor' events that enfolded within. To this day, I strongly believe something was just not quite right about that apartment building I lived in. Never felt safe in it."

"I have a very similar story to this. My sister and I each got a doll when I was around 7. The baby kind with baby clothes, side-by-side and kept right by our beds. My mom started noticing that every morning their heads would turn. I don't remember if they were towards us or away. Eventually, she announced that if they turned again she's going to trash them. The next morning both their heads didn't move.  Mom trashed them. 

I'm creeped out that this happened to you too. "
Think you could find a picture of it online? I'm really curious what it looks like.
"When I was a kid, I'd turn all my stuffed toys and dolls at night so that they were all facing the wall and not ""looking"" at me. In hindsight, I shouldn't have probably done that as it would be way creepier if they were already facing the wall and one or some or all of them turned around. :-|"
Wah! Scary as!! I had a similar fit about my dolls as a kid and made my parents throw all mine out- don't even know why now. Now have a minor phobia of them.

My old roommate's dad put a mask on the end of a broomstick and stuck it up in the bathroom window from outside the house while he was brushing his teeth. He was around ten years old.  He's 27 and still gets nervous around windows at night time."
"Fuck that, that is my nightmare, I'd never look out a window again."
Pure nightmare  fuel 
I'm terrified of windows without blinds because of the implication. Even standing near a window with blinds at night makes me get whatever I need quicker. I've seen too many horror movies where someone gets grabbed while they're at the sink I guess.
"as someone whose room is also ground level, i always stare at the blinds at night as they face a lamppost, i'm waiting for the night a big human figure appears on the other side of the blinds and creates that shadow.. it's very unsettling."
"Dude that is creepy and I guess that is why people are scared of windows at night time, I personally find them very unsettling at night time because it can be hard to tell what is staring back at me."
"I was staying alone in an empty house, the house I lived in while in high school now up for sale. I walked into a room which I forgot had a floor to ceiling mirror, occupying a complete wall in the master bedroom. It was dark and my own reflection scared the fuck out of me. Later the house which had a for sale sign out front was invaded by squatters while i was sleeping. They left when I told them there was nothing inside but this spooked me too so that every little sound at night put me on edge. Boy was I glad to get out of that place. Now I live in apartments or hotels; maybe noisier but always people nearby."
"Sounds like my hometown in Central Ohio. 3 stop lights, 4 gas stations, and 5 churches. "
Why are they afraid of security cameras if they wore ski masks?
I also graduated high school in 1984 and can confirm your $3.35/hour. :)
That must have been terrifying. Also you're a great story teller. 
i wrote a short story kinda like this 
Wide eyed and emotionless face? 
"As someone who has seizures, I know what you mean. For me, I'm conscious during mine when they start so I'm trapped in my rebelling body until I suffocate myself and black out. When I come back sometimes it takes a few seconds or minutes to remember who I am, or who the people are, where I am, or that I'm in my body again, and then the pain sets in. It's scary. I had multiples one day and my mother said my eyes looked empty, like I was a puppet. Sorry you had to see that. "
"One of the worst things I've ever seen was a girl going into a grand mal seizure. I'd always thought they didn't realize when it was happening, but the look of terror in her eyes. Obviously realizing what was about to happen, and not being able to do anything to stop it. It still freaks me out."
Some people really hate guests that over stay their welcome
What happened after that?! I must know! 
"> Wasn't really a ""party"" persay...

It's per se.

All aboard the nope train.
Huh. 16 year old me would have 100%  gone through with it. 
"Ohhh I've seen you before!!

Don't jump that jump nope!
I just read that thread this morning and was very confused thinking somebody stole the comment. I'm not smart.
"http://www.weirdus.com/states/pennsylvania/roadside_oddities/blue_mist_road/

That it?"
"Have a road like that near me called Riverdale. Local word says if you see a mist and you pull over, you'll hear someone running towards your car and screaming. Want to try it but also don't want to lose a pair of boxers if it's true."
i've been here before in the day time and it was still extremely unsettling 
"I can imagine the conversation in that truck:  

""Hey man, I think I see a kid out there, all by himself.  He looks a little lost.  I wonder if he needs help?""

""OK, let's go see if he's there--""

""Dude!  I SWEAR he was right here a few seconds ago!""

FFW 20 years:

""Dear reddit:  One of the creepiest moments I ever experiences was this one time we were driving in my friend's truck, and I saw this creepy looking kid, no more than 18, walking alone down an abandoned road....."""
Weird! Maybe some other kids had the same idea and the people in the truck were just their family looking for them?
Are you from west Michigan? Is so tell u/HeavenHill
Are you from West Michigan?
"Or, they knew it was dangerous for teens to be outside alone at that time"
Holy shit! Glad your roommates boyfriend was there!
"But then he knows where you live? Have you seen him again, and are you taking more safety precautions? "
That sounds really scary. Did you change which mess you were on or recover from the symptoms they were addressing? 
That actually sounds like a great plot for a bad horror movie.
"Nope, no thanks. "
I am currently laying in bed trying to get my son to sleep. He is also refusing and I was getting a bit annoyed. I will not ask him why he won't go to sleep. 
"*shudder* that reminds me of a time my daughter was still an infant. She usually slept really well but one night she was ballistic, could not be soothed. So I picked her up and tried to rock her to sleep when I suddenly got the worst feeling of dread I have ever felt, out of no where. I quickly noped out of her room and put the portable bassinet next to my bed that night. "
"From reading other askreddit threads asking about weird things their kids have done or said, it seems that kids up to the age of about 4 or 5, and animals can see things in the 'nether world in our midst' that we can't. I have an otherwise normal cat who often stares and meows at the wall for no reason. I think my guardian angel playfully messes with her sometimes. "
Kind of similar. Knew a guy who was mostly non verbal. Could indicate yes and no. One night he was staring into a corner saying yes or no occasionally. When asked if he was talking to somebody he said yes
It's crazy that the kid knew your reddit username
I would have shit my pants right there

"The gas leak thing is way overblown if you ask me. Sure it happens, but extremely rarely. People will latch onto any alternate 'explanation' in order to not have to admit that the supernatural exists."
Idk why but this one is way more terrifying than the ghost stories

what happened? what did he do?
"My parents took us kids to a junkyard once. I didn't really feel anything was off, but I do remember being struck by a burned-out car and seeing a tiny Dora the Explorer shoe inside, amidst all the rubble. I presume the little girl got out in time, but a small part of me has always wondered."
"Because a lot of souls crossed over into the other side from many of those rusting hulks, and their energy still lingers due to the catastrophic and violent nature of their deaths..."
I've dealt with sleep paralysis for as long as I can remember.  It used to scare the hell out of my.  I've learned to just calm myself down and fall back asleep now.  Hopefully you can get to that point as well.
"My trick to snap out of it is to focus on moving one finger. Ignore everything else and focus on moving a single finger. Then once you control that, extend it to lifting your hand.

You'll snap out of it pretty quickly. "
"Shit yo that reminds me. When I was 10 I had vivid dreams of a shadow person with red eyes staring at me through my window. Now at the time I had a little gargoyle statue I kept outside because my mom said it would protect the house from demons. But only if it was outside. Me being me decided to take it in and play with it. But I left it in my parents room, on the dresser. A week later I overheard my dad telling my mom about a nightmare he had. Said he saw a man with red eyes just staring into the bedroom but a weird looking creature was staring back at it. He said it was as if the man wanted to enter the room but couldn't. This freaked me out and I brought the gargoyle back outside.  Sleep paralysis is very common in my dads side of the family. "
"I've suffered from this since I can remember. I always called them night terrors until I did a little researching and found sleep paralysis.  Mine are always terrifying.  It's hard to explain... I know I'm aware, but parallel is a nightmare . After my divorce last year I moved into an apartment after selling my house. This place has such negative energy its palpable.  The nightmares I've had here are so terrifying and vivid. The last one I had still lingers. I've been trying to practice lucid dreaming but it hasn't worked yet. Big Art Bell / Coast to Coast fan"
i was going to say waking up while sleep walking.  it is not much of a story but its happened twice and the feeling of intense fear is really hard to explain. its overwhelming. 
I've heard wiggling your toes while this is happening can help. 
Can this only happen to some people? I have been sleeping on my back for years and have a pretty active imagination yet no once have I ever had sleep paralysis or night frights. Really anything of that nature.. maybe I'm lucky?
I've learned I have enough control to bite down. If I bite my tongue hard enough it wakes me up.
"Ah that old demon. I don't dream much, but when I do it's sleep paralysis related nightmares. Mine always revolve around my right arm being restrained, and to wake up I have to remove it so I can roll over and break the paralysis. 

The most recent was I had cancer, and my right arm was wrapped up and punctured with thousands of IVs. I had to ask the doctor to saw my arm off to get up. "
Do you know *why*?
I feel like I would have fucked with this guy. Just made sure he knew I knew.
What we're the questions?!?!
What was he following you guys around for? Did you father have a reason?
even the front windshield
Dude glad you are okay.

OMG. That thing was going to snatch you!
That's like three terrifying stories in one!

Wow an abandoned house for 13 years?.....wow
You have to tell the whole story now.

"I mean, ngl I'd date a girl who wants to do Urbex, that sounds dope."
Thats screwed up man. Since when did being NA preclude one from being held accountable for their shitty actions? 
Just promoting the damn stereotype >:( 
"Obviously your fault for forcing him to get intoxicated and then placing your window in the path of his incoming fist. 

You're lucky he didn't send you a hospital bill."
"I have to ask, was she paralyzed at the time? My mom once experienced sleep paralysis when I was a baby, and for years she was nearly convinced that freakin' ALIENS had come and messed with me in my crib right in front of her. It scared her to death. Come to find out you can get some pretty wicked hallucinations when you're experiencing sleep paralysis."
"That seems too be one heck of an experience, to say the least."
Reminds me of Solipsism. Or narcissism. Just replace 'God' with 'Nothing' and you have Trent Reznor.

"Man, that is really spooky, and it's really uncommon for a recurring nightmare to go on so long. Have you tried lucid dreaming exercises? I've had recurring nightmares before, obviously not as long, and either they resolve on their own or I have to stop and acknowledge that I'm in a dream and try to snap out of it. Seizing control, even for a moment, can stop a dream or nightmare from recurring because you break the cycle."
I read your whole post. I'm so sorry you had to go thru that.
I'm sorry you didn't have the happiness you deserved in your childhood. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if these losers ended up in jail.

"Did you see that video of the 2 dudes sleeping on cots fully clothed? One dude, the guy closest to the security camera, his legs start to lift in the air while he's seemingly asleep. Next thing you know, he flies off the end of the bed, his body moving exactly the way it would if someone invisible had lifted up his legs then just whipped him off the bed and dumped him on the floor. You can see him wake up during his trip through the air, his eyes go all wide and it looks like he's yelling. It could be fake, but if it is, it's well done. It looks like they're in some sort of back room in an office or workplace, maybe doing shift work or something? Idk why they're sleeping fully dressed on cots, but that's part of what makes it seem real: the lack of pretext. You think if you were going to fake this kind of video, you'd make the people be sleeping at night, in pyjamas. Anyway, your post made me think of it.  "
Scary during even scarier after.

"I think some animals can make very human sounds.

You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As they say in Texas. I’ll bet you couldn’t pour !@#$ out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won’t go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.
You’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.
You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.
I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?
Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.
You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.
You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.
And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?
You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.
On a good day you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient
in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.
You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted
fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.
You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate,
noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away.
I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.
Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.
You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond
the laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don’t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.
The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn’t really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.
True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ”normal” people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ”challenged” persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn’t have been ”right”.
Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.

Windows are fucking terrifying. Why are more people not afraid of windows?
Driving is gonna be... tough.
I'm the exact same I have to have all the blinds and curtains closed if it's dark. My son has a ground floor bedroom and did not settle when we first moved here until we put black out curtains up and he could no longer see the windows or shadows at night.

"The really scary part is how used them my coworkers and I have gotten to them.

"There's not really a solid reason why it happens to some and not to others. I find after I've had a heavy night of drinking it happens. Not always. But apparently if you're of sufferer it, sleeping on your back can cause it. However, mine usually starts when I'm on my side."

"Well he says he just wanted to know how we were, however the way he went about it and the things he was trying to find out about didn't add up. In about 2010 I saw a letter that his investigator had written to him, and it was all about the trouble I had in school, where my mom worked, how much debt she was supposed to have been in... A lot of the letter was bullshit, not sure where he got the info from, but it made us out to be abandoned for hours on end cause she would run down to the store and leave a 14 and 15 year old in the house while she went and bought us some soda or something from the store. He mentioned a few times that he thought my mom was an unfit mother, and I now think that the PI was hired to build a case to prove that so he could take back custody of us, but the majority of the PI's reports were unfounded or completely fabricated, so that would have never happened.

He was trying to build a case to say she was an unfit mother so he could get custody of us. However when my folks divorced and my mom remarried, he wrote a letter to the courts saying that he washed his hands of us and wanted nothing to do with us ever again. Apparently he changed his mind. He tried to tell me that he just wanted to know how we were doing. "
"Well my father says that he just wanted to know we were okay... A lot of the pictures were of my mom, where she was working, who her friends were etc... The reports returned to him had a lot of info about my mom, some of them more than there was info about me and my sister. He mentioned to me a few times about my mom being unfit to raise us, and he could have given us a much better life, and that he tried his utmost to give us that... I think he was trying to build a case to prove she was an unfit mother so he could get custody of me and my sister, however he never actually tried. "

The previous owner was called John. He died 25 years ago.
"She was just barely 1 year old when we moved in.  She was barely walking and only knew a few words like 'mama', 'dada', or 'hot' (we taught her from an early age not to touch the stove because it was hot).  If she was playing with her toys on the floor she would keep a very close eye on us and if we would leave the room or looked like we were going to leave the room she would start crying in panic.  If you have kids you will know there are different kinds of crying.  For example if a kid cries because they are tired or if they hurt themselves, these are two completely different kinds of cries.  The energy and emotion behind her crying was of panic.  She would cry in panic if we left her in her room at night to fall asleep so we had to be there with her until she did.

At first we just thought it was because it was a different house.  Eventually I caught on to the fact that she would often be looking in corners where there was nothing of interest as though she was looking at a person or thing that I and my wife could not see.  Her panic and sense of urgency were escalating where it just seemed like it was getting worse.

After the medium cleared the house she had developed a habit of being accustomed to us being around her, so she still would act as though she wanted us in the room when playing or when going to bed, but the key difference was that the sense of panic and urgency was gone that night.  It was no longer at the level of emergency.  The cry had transitioned into an ""I'm not getting my way"" type of cry.  Furthermore she could be playing with her toys in a room and get distracted enough that we could leave and she wouldn't notice.  Prior to clearing this never happened.  Eventually she learned to let go of that attachment because again, there was no urgent need for us to be there to protect her from whatever it was.  

According to the medium we had an older female presence that was very fixated on our daughter.  Apparently she was terrified of crossing over into the light.  Fear of judgment perhaps.  The medium helped to lay down and ultimatum that she could either leave or cross over but she wasn't staying.  He did his thing and that was the end of it, for that chapter."
"It wasn't as bad as it might sound. It was built in 1985 by a well known builder in our area. He built it for himself and his family (wife and young son). He died of a heart attack in 1989 so his wife sold it to a doctor and his family. In 1998 the doctor's kids graduated hs, left home for college, and then his wife divorced him. He moved in with his sister down the road. His sister kept the place up minimally like mowed the lawn and cleaned. They didn't keep up on the maintenance though. It needed a new roof, new windows, and updating when we moved in. 1985 called and wanted their kitchen back. 

So it was vacant and nobody lived there but it was not totally abandoned. Just in dire need of attention and updating. I don't fully understand why he held onto it for so long. We think he wanted to give it to his kids but they didn't want anything to do with him. Years later he did put it on the market but was asking too much and wouldn't negotiate. When we looked at it he had finally dropped the price to a reasonable amount.

*edit - fixed an autocorrect word that was not correct :)"
Right? OP never watched the discovery channel...
"You can read a good portion of the story above in my reply to allisslothed.  I can add to this but many might find it a bit hard to wrap their minds around.  What the hell though...

After my daughter began having her reactions to something that my wife and I seemingly could not see or hear, I wanted to exhaust all the options.  I was certainly open to the paranormal as my mom had told me stories of experiences she had growing up, but I was still skeptical as I had never had any experiences of my own.  In my google searching I had found a self-proclaimed psychic's web page that said if you want to be more aware of the paranormal, you should meditate on the intention of becoming more aware. 

I had never meditated before so I really didn't know what to do.  I found some generic guided meditations online though and began doing a daily meditation after getting home from work.  I visualized myself becoming more aware in my relaxed state.  I must say that it didn't take very long before I began having experiences of my own.  I wasn't seeing dead people or anything, but I would have intuitive flashes of things before they would happen.  Mostly it was small stuff.  One example is that I was walking down the hallway at work thinking about work stuff when suddenly for no reason I started thinking of falling money.  I walked around the corner only to see a man standing in front of a vending machine looking to make a selection and then suddenly dropping his money.  This started happening to me several times a day.

I was in a way getting what I was asking for, but at the same time it all the sudden got very real for me.  It's easy to conceptually humor paranormal crap but to all of the sudden have that suddenly become a part of your life...  It's intense.  I didn't know who to talk to about it.  I went back to google and found a meetup group that talked about the spiritual, paranormal, and other fun stuff.  I didn't know what kind of weirdos I would meet there, but I knew I needed to try finding someone who knew more than I did.

Thankfully I was greeted with a bunch of completely down to earth normal people who all just had extraordinary experiences.  Many had the paranormal as a part of their lives since birth.  I told my tales and experiences only to be greeted with understanding and support.  It was a great relief.  This is where I met the medium who helped me to clear the house.  After he was able to demonstrate results, I knew I needed to keep going to this group and learn as much as I could.

Since then I have sought to learn and experience as much as I could, wherever it was safe to do so.  I learned about all kinds of things and tried things like pendulum dowsing, past life regressions, pranic healing, and controlled remote viewing (as it was used by the military).  What I have walked away with several years later is that there is a great deal of truth to a lot of things considered paranormal.  I actually think that these abilities are quite normal.  It is just that we don't talk about them and we don't acknowledge them.  As a result we don't develop these skills.  Anyway, as I mentioned above, my life hasn't been the same since, but it has been a very rewarding journey.  Thanks for reading.

"So, I'm an engineer by degree and I know that my story sounds semi-hippy, I assure you I did try to approach all of this from as logical and as rational a manner as possible.  I kept an open mind, but I wanted to understand how and why things were happening.  After having success with meditation and I started having seemingly psychic experiences, I wanted to learn more about how the mind worked.  I later learned about and experienced hypnosis.  I realized hypnosis was incredibly similar to meditation.  

In hypnosis you bring your dominant brainwave state into the alpha range or deeper into the theta range.  Meditation is the same.  for some reason our consciousness shifts in these brainwave states and we are more open to experiences that the brain would otherwise normally filter out.  Interestingly children spend a great deal more time with their brainwaves in the dominant alpha state.  Does this mean they are more susceptible to spirits?  Perhaps.  I won't rule it out because it certainly would explain some stuff.  I don't know how to quantify that or measure it though so until then I will just say I don't know but I'm open to the possibility..."
Same.... now I have that unsettled feeling that's not going away until it just wears off.  Very disturbing story.
I ain't got a problem with exploring abandon places but the sole reason she chose the Asylum was because of the theater and the crematorium. Like I am down to explore but lets not spend the whole time in the basement of this haunted place
It might've been. My mom told me that she wanted to scream but was too scared to. Idk of that has anything to do with sleep paralysis.
It's never really gone away. It's lonely.

I think it's mentioned as a potential reason why strangers were taking photos of them (assuming night bunny is Asian). When my dad went to a remote vigil in China they all kept touching his beard and staring at him. They all wanted to see the unusual looking man with the strange facial hair. 
"What KatefromtheHudd said. I assume it would be creepy regardless to be taking someone's pictures like that, but since we were an oddity, it would make it somewhat understandable. 

I should have clarified, I am Asian so people would stare at and mock us all the time for how we looked. There were plenty of uncomfortable moments, but this one takes the cake."

"When she moved to her new house, she was looking out the window washing dishes. She looked past her reflection and saw the neighbour lady watching her, through a facing window in her own house.  She looked afraid. Then the lady's face turned panicked, and the poster then heard a door open in her home and thought the door opening behind her was her mom's boyfriend.  But saw in the reflection on the window glass a masked man.  I am not clear on who the man was talking to but he intended to rape her.  Then, the would be rapist saw the old lady watching, through  the window and left instead.

I don't know if that helps haha."
Yes. Congestive heart failure. Died right before we got kicked out. 
Yeah I was kidnapped when I was 3 by my nanny. She found out in a very short stretch of time that she was unable to have children and that she was being deported. I was pretty young so I'm not sure how much is me remembering the actual incident and how much is my parents telling me. I do remember her as my nanny and liking her and then her suddenly not being around any more. I was missing for less than 24 hours but they found she and I hiding in her grandparents garage behind the washer.

"Oh my God... The part about seeing the room around you, is it because your eyes are open or are you imagining it? 

Becuase when I'm really tired and try to sleep I close my eyes and it's like my brain reconstructs the environment I'm in. No matter if it's bedroom or back seat of a car.

 If there are people are around me talking I can almost see them, talking; their lips opening and closing. Although I know my eyelids are closed.

 It's like echo locating, if you know what I mean. I hear them and my brain assigns them a place in the room, and it's very close to reality. 

Sometimes I get confused which one is real, the one in my head or with my eyes open. 

I have had the so-called ""nightmare syndrome"" as a kid, I wonder if it's coming back.  "

I have 2 large dogs that i absolutely would not get rid of, so that narrowed my options of places to move in my daughters school district to 2, and the other wasn't renting. There are just alot of unhappy people here. The man upstairs beat his wife up , you can hear kids getting screamed at which to me is pretty severe. I think all this type of negative energy just builds up...like the slime in Ghostbusters.  Lol
But without writing a huge novel about it, in the last nightmare there was a large black mass. I sage my home regularly so i was starting to do that and it wouldn't let me light it. I tried to recite the Lord's prayer and it was like it took the words from me. I open my bible and every page was blank. So all this along with the paralysis really scared the shit out of me."

"nobody ever wants to believe it, but it is the most useful sense by far. 
  
  you know when people are arguing in a room full of others and the tension in the air is so thick? or when you get surprised by a mean dog that starts barking at you and you get that internal gut feeling of fear/dread/ready to fight feeling? those are the most common vibes that every human feels because its a high emotion situation. 
  
  any time you hear about ""a gut feeling/situation"" that turned out to be true is due to the vibes. I'm using scary scenarios as the examples cuz thats what like 99% of normal people only realize its from. However you can feel every single emotion, and it is much more clear than talking will ever be. there is no hiding how you feel and i believe it is because of speech that humans no longer use this sense.
  
  people wonder how animals communicate, and it is 100% through this, and it's much much more efficient, as you can feel the vibes being given off from any animal."

Apparently it was a thing in his HS to get people drunk, then dump them out in the middle of nowhere so that they can walk back.

My friend dipped into the woods because he just did not have a good feeling about it. The guy that was with him tried to wave down the truck, but the people in the truck started shooting at him. They both ran like hell through the woods while the truck kept making sweeps up and down the road looking for them. "

"Lol, I thought about that as I was typing it.  I have had more experiences than I can count since these initial catalyzing events in my life.  I have no reason to suspect that the original 'visitor' ever came back.  As far as I know, once you cross over you don't come back until reincarnating.  I have experiences that support this belief, but I will caveat my statement with the fact that it is just that, a belief based on supporting experiences.  We will all find out at some point, but until then I go on what I can.

A semi-short synopsis would be that my daughter has made comments of seeing a man in our office on the day one great uncle died, a man in the bathroom on the day another great uncle died, and a woman by the garage on the day my aunt died.  These were friendly or benign experiences.  I've had other unfriendly 'visitors' that I've picked up on and that my daughter have picked up on that we've had to clear.  Unfriendlies don't feel the same.  They make the hair on your neck and arms stand up and you just feel the unease.  It's hard to describe.  I've awoken to see 2 full body apparitions in the form of black shadows, but surprisingly these both felt friendly or benign.  

I remember one time back in 2013 when my family and I witnessed a woman rear end a motorcyclist who was stopped at a red light.  She had fallen asleep at the wheel.  He wasn't wearing a helmet and had severe head trauma.  My brother is a surgeon and luckily was with us at the time.  A nurse was also in the area.  Between my brother and the nurse they were able to keep the man stable and alive until help arrived.  The woman was hysterical and I felt pretty helpless watching so I decided to try and calm her down.  she kept saying, ""I'm going to hell, I'm going to hell, I'm going to hell..""  I think I said something along the lines of, ""If there is such a place, surely it's not for people who do things on accident.""  I'm not sure if that was any help or not, but I tried.  

A care flight took the man to the hospital and we gave our statements.  Finally we went home.  It was a pretty crazy experience.  Late that night, or in the wee hours of the next morning, I should say, I woke up around 3 am out of a sound sleep.  i had a very strong impression of that man as though he was standing in the middle of my bedroom and all I heard were the words, ""thank you.""  then he was gone.  

I shook it off thinking it was just my imagination, but it was a damn weirdly powerful experience.  The next morning my brother called me around 9am.  He started doing small talk, which is weird for him.  First of all he never calls.  Second, he never does small talk.  I asked him what was up and he told me that the man had died in the hospital early that morning around 3am.  I kind of knew he was going to say that, but part of me wanted to believe it was just my imagination.  

This was a really awe inspiring experience for me.  I mean, first of all, this dude didn't know me from Adam.  I was just a random stranger.  All I did was pray for the man as I sat there feeling helpless watching my brother and the nurse work on him.  I also tried to comfort the woman who hit him.  I got a strong impression along with the thank you that it was intended towards me for not only praying for him but also for trying to comfort the woman who hit him, and also it was for my brother for what he did to try and save him.  It's hard to describe how that information came through, but it is kind of like when you are in a dream and you just understand a situation even though you normally wouldn't have access to all the information.  Anyway, I can't prove these experiences as they are just conscious experiences.

I think that is the folly of many ghost hunters.  I believe they are trying to capture physical proof of something that is completely non-physical.  The only way we can truly know the non-physical is to experience with the parts of ourselves that is non-physical.  I can have a meditation experience or a psychic experience but there is never any words that can do it justice.  Nothing I do to try and convey the experience to another will capture the fullness and the richness of the experience.  So much is lost in the translation.

If we want to know the non-physical we have to go out and have our own experience.  Yeah, there will be a lot of initial fear and uncertainty, but fear and uncertainty can be disarmed by gaining knowledge, understanding, and experience.  It has been a rewarding journey.  "

I'm always happy to talk about this stuff.  I first learned remote viewing from David Morehouse's 2008 book that teaches you how to do it.  I highly recommend it as it is a low cost way of learning and trying your hand at it.  
"The movie 'The Men Who Stare at Goats' was loosely based on the military's involvement in psychic research for military use.  Note that at the very beginning of the movie it starts with a screen that states, ""More of this is true than you would believe.""  Basically in the early 1970s the CIA contracted the Stanford Research Institute in California to look into the paranormal to weigh the seriousness of the intelligence they were collecting that said other countries were pouring millions of dollars into these kinds of programs.  

A former NSA employee was a physicist out there, Dr. Hal Puthoff, and he ended up working with a natural psychic by the name of Ingo Swann to study his abilities and verify if they were real.  Once it was established that Ingo was indeed gifted at being able to describe things removed from him by space, time, or shielding, they worked together to reverse engineer a pen and paper process so that this ability could be taught to regular folks off the street.  

In the late 1970's and early 1980's the Army took this teachable process and created an active intelligence gathering program.  It went by many names over the years as it was a controversial program and got shuffled from organization to organization.  In the 1990s one of the Army's former unit members, Major David Morehouse, wrote a book called 'Psychic Warrior', that exposed the Army's use of psychic spying.  

He was threatened with court marshal but Morehouse thought it was important to get this out to the public.  In what seems to be an effort of damage control the DoD distanced itself from the program, hired 2 people to do a study and write a report about the effectiveness of the program without giving them any classified access, and then used that report as a reason to discredit the program and shut it down.  In Sept. of 1995 the news broke on Nightline and the talking heads interviewed several government folks that said it never really went anywhere.

Remote viewing was declassified and everyone had a good laugh.  There were some folks who took this seriously though.  Several of the former military unit members such as David Morehouse, Paul Smith, Lyn Buchanan, and others began offering training and remote viewing for hire services.  Over the last 22 years the remote viewing community has quietly and slowly grown.

There are indeed private investigators who offer remote viewing services and there are law enforcement agencies, private businesses, and regular off the street individuals who utilize these services.  Yet if you go to Wikipedia you could walk away believing that it is all just a big joke.  I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I certainly wonder when I see discredit and disinformation pieces like that in our mainstream sources of information.

I learned remote viewing so I know it works.  I also know that it is never 100% accurate so those areas of inaccuracy are always used against it.  The amount that it is accurate is what amazes me because statistically it seems completely impossible unless there is some sort of hidden connection between all things in space and time.  I recommend watching some youtube interviews of Hal Puthoff if you want some good RV program history.  If you want to learn I recommend David Morehouse's 2008 book that teaches the full 6 stages of the pen and paper process.  It's like 10$ used on amazon so it's pretty low cost/low risk.  "

"Hey thanks! Yeah, I am a metal head too. My YouTube list is filled with guitar lesson videos though because I'm an obsessed musician haha. Thanks for the link. I love stuff like this. Big believer in the paranormal. "
"That all sounds nice and well, but you deliver no proof for your claims."
"That is pretty funny. Do you find dolls in general creepy? Or was it just this one that rubbed you the wrong way? Dolls don't freak me out, except for the famous haunted doll Robert. Look him up if you dare. His story of why he was made and what happened after is spooky to me. He's in a museum of sorts now. One employee at the museum reports that Robert escapes his case sometimes at night."
"I dunno, sounds pretty spooky to me"
"It likely wouldn't have been them all fighting this guy. Instead he could grab the one at the door and put a knife to her throat, and use that to control the others.   So even 6 on 1, he would have almost total control as no one wants to risk her getting killed."
"Well I mean from a strictly objectivr point of view almost all men are stronger than almost all women. 

Add in adrenaline to the mix and it gets a little bit murkier, but both you and your attacker have the benefit of that... Plus they might have a weapon if they had the preparation and preplanning of following you home, etc. 

Let's just say any type of physical altercation sucks, but if you're a woman it's going to be extra sucky because the odds are stacked against you that you are going to be at a literally huge physical advantage to begin. 

Pretending that this isn't the case is naivete at best and fatal at worst.  

Of course in a life or death situation you give it your all, but the smartest move is to avoid it as much as humanly possible even if you're 600 pounds of pure knuckle."

"Very little consistency on any of these, to be honest. 

Let's take a look at [Old Shuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Shuck?wprov=sfla1) - ask the historical land owners, and he's a universally demonic thing to be feared... But ask the farm workers, and he only attacks wrong doers. And always protects lone female travellers at night. 

Nobody can even decide if it's bad luck to talk about seeing him or not. Or even if sea salt keeps him at bay (farmers say yes). Hell, they can't even agree on what he looks like. "
Agreed. It was a cool story.

"You have really opened my eyes tonight, especially about the ghost hunters thing. I think you're absolutely right in everything you said and I'd like to extend my respect for you because you seem to respect the things you can't see or understand, namely spirits.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences!
You sound very spiritual. Almost blessed by something or someone. 
"Try some Terro, it's ant killer from the hardware store, about $4. That stuff works so well on ants, I'm convinced it would keep spirits at bay, too. Just sprinkle a little on the doorways and in the basement. "
"Ill look into it? Ive read some ""Seth"", the Jane Roberts channeling, and some Kryon channeling. Also read a very ibteresting declassified CIA document about remote viewing and the nature of the universe. Fascinating stuff"
"Sweet titties! Rock on, brother!  Mine is full of paranormal and conspiracy videos. And Mr bungle /tomahawk/Fantomas/fnm albums.

Or is house just male no matter what?"
"if you have never felt those emotions youre a sociopath or devils advocate (aka dick😜) either way youre just another human who adamantly refuses to believe theres a sense you are wasting. i gave you 2.5 scenarios where you are able to feel it, and when you do, you have to consciously remember that feeling and over time with more high emotion experiences you will learn to feel it more in normal situations and everyday life. 
  
  would highly recommend taking acid for initial kickoff of knowing the feeling, it happens deep in your chest seemingly from nowhere, just inside you."
"I don't mind dolls (though I'd rather keep the weird lookin ones like Robert away). However, I do find human babies extremely creepy. Was it the doll experience that made babies creepy for me? Or did my fear of babies lead me to find the doll creepy? Who knows?"
I doubt he planned that far ahead

"It's cool, have a good day dude :)"
"Lol, one of my biggest pet peeves is when it is suggested that you need something physical to ward off something non-physical.  It just never made sense to me.  People say to burn sage all the time or to put salt down.  The guy who cleared our house showed me you don't need any of that.  

If you think about it, if we are truly souls temporarily inhabiting physical bodies, then it stands to reason we come equipped with everything we will ever need just as we are.  I mean, how are you going to see without eyes, think without a brain, move without legs, etc?  Kind of like how you operate in the environment of a dream, you just move by will and intent.  You just experience by being.  The will and intent are what is key in psychic protection and clearing.  Want the doorway open to 'home' (that tunnel of light that bridges this physical world to the sprit world or whatever you prefer to call it)?  Call it with your mind and visualize it with will and intent.  Lost spirits seem to not realize they can do this.  

Want protection?  Visualize a wall of energy going up around you.  Yeah, it feels like you're playing with your imagination, but to people who are particularly sensitive to the energetic, doing things like that changes the environment for them dramatically.  You see it happen enough times and you can start to realize the correlation isn't necessarily coincidental.  To each their own though..."
That question is out of my area of expertise. If you want to talk music theory or about who is the best guitar players in music then I'm your source lol. Although I love the show ghost adventures. Zak is hilarious. 
"You're still not citing any sources or any evidence for if what you're saying is actually true, which leds me to believe there's not actually any proof and you're just making up things."
"I get these feelings even when nothing is wrong. It's just paranoia. Not everything has deep reasons or untapped senses behind it.

People like to think life is more interesting than it really is, so we invent dumb stuff like a 6th sense to add mystery to it. Confirmation bias (where the gut feeling led to nothing) only adds to this."
"Ugh. That dude is so chachi. I mean, I'm sure he's a nice guy and all, but there's something about him that just picks my ass.

I'm more a drum geek. Its the first thing I hear in music, is the rhythm section. I used to not like solos actually, but I just couldn't get down with numetal. The sickness wasn't sick enough for me. As for best drummers, the Greek guy from Nile, Nicholaus something, and John Longstreth from Angelcorpse/Origin. "

This 4th of July I stayed with my friends who are a married couple. They got into a fight and decided that it was time to separate while I was there. It was awful.
"Years ago I dated a woman who liked to masturbate to porn videos...of herself...masturbating. After much convincing, I agreed to have the sex with her while she watched it. Then, she became more comfortable and showed me her *other* fap videos: her having sex with her previous partners. She also wanted to have the sex while watching those together. I declined and she became enraged, confused how this might be a bit off.

She may or may not have been a narcissist."
"My girlfriend and I live together. We broke up about three weeks ago. I don't have a place to go, so I still live here and sleep on the couch. Every day she gets more angry and aggressive (with words). I'll have to stay until I have enough for an apartment, probably two months. 
I'd say this is probably the most awkward situation I've been in. "

"I was an incredibly awkward 8th grader. I mean social anxiety ridden and absolutely no social skills. One of my good friend who was a girl was dared to start grinding me at a school dance and incredibly awkward me pushed her away, looked her right in the eye, and walked away back to my table. I didn't even make eye contact with her the rest of the dance. I hate this thread for making me remember it..."
"I was in class and this girl who was very slutty and all around trashy, like posting pictures with weed and bud light at lunch (she was 16) but i made a comment about how she has daddy issues and she quickly replied back with ""well my dad died when i was young asshole how do you feel now?"" i was kind of an asshole at the time and and replied with ""it makes me feel like im right"""
When me and my girlfriend first started dating in high school and we started to get intimate we'd have conversations via text messages about sexual things we'd done. It wasn't anything over board but definitely private messages. One time I'm over and we are watching tv when her mom comes into the room and asks if she could have a word with us. She sat us both down to have a conversation about how her daughter gave me a BJ from our texts. It was one of those situations where you had to smile because it was so over the top awkward no other reaction was reasonable. I had no idea what to say. I just sat there with this uncontrollable grin on my face. Still don't even know what we were talking about because I literally hid in my head as I made an attempt to fast forward through a incredibly uncomfortable moment. 
"I work in a small hospital. we had two kids come in the ER after a 4 wheeler accident. The younger one was in critical condition due to suspected brain bleed, he was barely conscious and vomiting. I took him for a CT scan, and halfway through, his grandma yells, he needs to use the bathroom. knowing there no nurses available, and that with his injuries he can't leave the table, I grab a urinal bottle and some gloves and set to work. I lowered his underwear, and placed the bottle, but his little gentleman's sausage was so small It would not go into the bottle. I gently squeezed it and pointed at the bottle waiting for him to go for about 1 minute(accounting for stage fright). when nothing came out, I looked at the kid, who was previously nearly unconscious, but was now wearing a terrified look on his face. With eyes the size of dinner plates, and a little tremor in his voice, he said "" I don't need to pee, I need to throw up""

TL;DR  listened to a grandma, ended up holding a little boy's penis.

There was time when I was at my parent's place, and my dad still has the habit of just barging into my room without knocking. I was skyping with my then boyfriend and I was....busy. He knocks from then onwards.

The second incident's when I was working with my dad and left my portable speakers in the office. He returned them to me all awkward and going, ""Er...you left your...toy in the office.""

Then I realized they look like [this](http://imgur.com/a/3jSlK). In hindsight, I should've corrected the misunderstanding by smoothly replying with, ""Oh, you mean my portable speakers!"" 

But at that time, I just went, ""Er..thanks."" "

"Close to 10 years ago now, I was moving to a new city for school. I'd signed an apartment lease, but the lease didn't actually begin until a week after classes started. I didn't know anyone in the city.

With precious little time remaining, I explained my predicament to my friend and his girlfriend. The girlfriend, call her ""Ellen,"" made an amazing offer. She said I could live in her mom's house, which was about an hour drive from my school. Her mom was out of town on business or something, there was no dad in the picture, and Ellen was in a dorm, meaning I would have an entire house to myself for a week. I asked Ellen if she was sure this arrangement would be OK with her mom. She assured me it was no trouble. She told me to call her the day I arrived at the house, and she'd bring a spare key. 

The night before school started, I pulled into the driveway of Ellen's mom's house with my car packed with all my worldly possessions. The house was at the end of a cul-de-sac in a very crowded suburb. This was at about 6 PM.  

I called Ellen for the key. Ellen had completely forgotten I was coming that night and said she was at work until 10. I was annoyed, but there was nothing I could do, so I drove to a movie theater and saw a movie. I got back to the house around 9 and sat in my car, waiting. 

Around 9:30, the driveway was illuminated by headlights. Was it Ellen, home from work early? No, it was some random middle-aged dude. He parked right next to my car, got out, produced a key and went into the house (he did take a moment to stare at my car, but he couldn't see me what with it being dark and my car so full of crap ). I could only speculate that this must be a boyfriend of the mom or something. I called Ellen a bunch of times. No answer. 

After 10 minutes of wondering what the fuck to do, I got out of the car and knocked on the door. I explained to the complete stranger (who had changed into a T-shirt and sweatpants) that I was a friend of Ellen's and she said I could spend the night here. He was confused, but he must have thought my story checked out, because he took me into the house and found an air mattress and blanket for me in a closet. 

He inflated the mattress and brought it to the top of the stairs, where there was this big landing that led into a hallway for the bathroom and master bedroom. He left the mattress on the landing, hit the lights, and I laid there in the dark, thinking about life, while the guy watched TV downstairs. 

This was already my most awkward and uncomfortable experience, but the night was still young. Not only had Ellen forgotten to mention my visit to her mother, she was wrong about her mother being gone for the week. So around 10, I heard a middle-aged woman come into the house. There was a quiet discussion downstairs which I assume was about me. She started coming up the stairs. I pulled the blanket over my head and pretended to be asleep while she brushed her teeth a few feet away from me.

I think an argument with Ellen may have followed; I'm not sure. Somehow I fell asleep, or maybe I literally passed out from embarrassment. The next morning, I had a brief breakfast with the mom and boyfriend, thanked them for letting me stay the night, and drove off.  Which is how I became homeless for a week.

"My friend was buying a car from an estate sale store.  It was after hours and I dropped him off and went to go get a parking spot and then join him.  Walked back, got buzzed in and went into the small shop.  As I turned the corner into the main room of the shop  the owner pointed a cocked three fifty seven at my head.  

I explained my friend was test driving the Celica, he laughed, but it away and asked me my opinion of the Rangers (Dallas, Texas) that season."
"There have been many awkward/uncomfortable moments in my life so far, however, this fairly recent incident came to mind.

About 2 years ago, I was ""in between jobs"", and took a crappy business-to-business sales job position because...well...because I got suckered into it.  (No offense to anyone working sales and actually does well and enjoys their job...it just wasn't for me)

I had been working this shitty job for a few weeks when I had a medical emergency, and had to undergo surgery.  After a few days, I started feeling somewhat back to normal, so I decided to go back to work.  I took all of the post-surgery prescribed medications on my way into work.  I hadn't eaten breakfast, so I checked all the RX labels on the bottles to make sure I could take them on an empty stomach.  None of the said to take with food, so I thought I was good to go. 

I head out with my sales partner for the day, and start feeling nauseous...like when you've drank too much and got the spins kind of nauseous.  I kept telling myself to shake it off and try to focus on something else in hopes of feeling better.  Once we reach our destination and park, I start feeling worse.  At that point I'm trying to hold down a bunch of dry heaves.  My partner doesn't notice, so I think I'm going to be ok.  We're walking to the entrance of our first business, and my dry heaves are becoming uncontrollable.  I figured 'fuck..I can't go in there I have to tell him I'm feeling awful'.  So I stop him before he reaches for the door of the building and say 'hey I'm like really not feelin-WHUUUUAG' dry heaving mid sentence.  He jumps back all WTF and I continue to try and talk and dry heave... But since I hadn't eaten breakfast, nothing was coming out except for a giant, string of mucous/spit dangling from my mouth...I was not a pretty sight.

This continued for the longest 5 minutes of my life. 

Oh and it was along one of the busiest intersections in downtown Seattle, during the morning traffic rush.  EVERYONE in their cars, walking to work, living their life, got to see the show. 

He had for drive me all the way back to the office (because we didn't take my car, of course) right after driving us all the way downtown...and he got to witness one of the grossest moments of my life. 

I went home.  My husband took that day off work.  I told him what happened, he laughed, I cried, he laughed some more, then he took care of me all day.  

Oh, and my discharge papers said to take the medications with food.   WHY DIDN'T THEY PUT THE STICKER ON THE BOTTLE THAT SAYS TO TAKE IT WITH FOOD?! (Anyone who's a pharmacist, feel free to let me know)

Oh, and I never went back to that job after that.  I will probably be forever known as the girl who dry heaved all over Mercer Street.

TL;DR. I took some meds on an empty stomach and dry heaved in front of everyone in downtown Seattle."
"I was at a small high school party for a girl I hadn't seen since the 4th grade. Things were going pretty well, the group walked around in the woods and she expressed her disdain that her boyfriend make it to the party. Throughout the party though, she's just getting super close to this one guy who came without his girlfriend. 

We were all in the basement relaxing and the two of them start making out. Everyone in the room is cheering except me and the dude next to me and we're like ""Uh... we're watching two people cheat."" I was going to leave there and then, but they were making out on the steps, which were also the only exit from the basement.

The dude I was next to snapped a pic of it on his phone and sent it to their SO's. Shit went down fast, like not even 5 minutes later the boyfriend shows up and everyone was on her side except me and the other dude, we just noped the fuck out and hung out in the barn to wait for it all to blow over.

A close second was when I had to wait on my porch with a shotgun because my stepsister's baby daddy and friends were coming over to start shit since they were drunk. They stopped thinking this was a good idea when they saw me, especially once I started aiming (One got a little too close to comfort.)"
"When I was about 5 or 6 our teacher used to stash a tin of sweets in a cupboard in the room where we would store our bags, jackets and lunch boxes which was also next to the bathroom. 

Clever little me clocked that on pretence of using the little girls room I could sneak in the cupboard and steal a sweetie. It was the perfect plan... Until the stupid bitch of a teaching assistant caught me red handed and dragged me out in front of my 30 or so classmates. The teacher (an even bigger bitch) forced my mouth open with her hands and made me show the whole classroom my guilty chocolatey mouth. 

I still cried and denied any wrong doing. The laughed as kids do and from then on I was also the thief as well as the weird kid. "
"Family Christmas party that I hadn't attended for many years (due to college and lack of interest in general). This side has about 70 people or so, aunts, uncles, cousins, boyfriends, girlfriends etc.

So I show up after a 4 year absence and an aunt comes up to me and sarcastically says 'You probably don't even remember my name!' Everyone turns and looks at the scene that was just created. To which I just stared back at her because I actually didn't. 

Tl;dr Aunt activates Catholic Guilt, accuses me of not remembering her name, causes scene, I actually didn't remember her."
"I was home from college and went to my parents' church. During the service there is always a part where everyone greets each other, shakes hands, etc. I saw an older man who had gone on a few youth trips with me a few years before, so I went to say hi and give him a hug. 

As I looked up from him at the end of the hug, I noticed his awkward, pained look...just before I noticed that my ex-boyfriend (who I hadn't spoken to since the break up) was also hugging the man. 

TL;DR: Three way of awkwardness at church"
"I sent flowers to this girl I liked in the university. Anonymously. She loved it. Short time after her, two friends and I went to a party. In the party we had fun. At some point I told her that I sent the flowers. She was speechless. She went away. I roamed about for a while, only to find her talking to one of my friends, crying ""what should I do"". My friend proceeded answering ""well tell him the truth, he'll handle it"". I was like two meters away from them. That was brutal."
Had my first physical when I was round 25. Was told there would be a digital rectal exam. Thought it would be a digital meter. It was not. 
"I was in kindergarten and my teacher was ranting about something for a couple of minutes or so. We sat on a large carpet, didn't really have desks.

I had to throw up badly, but didn't want to interrupt her. I threw up all over my skirt quietly, but nobody seemed to notice except the kid sitting next to me."
"This one tops my list (although, I can't say 'ever in my life'):

Awhile ago I came back home for my grandma's funeral. My Dad at one point was regaling us with stories of his childhood, just some random fond memories. He told us of a babysitter he had named Dick, who was just the coolest guy. My dad, a little kid, looked up to him and wanted to be just like him.
Later that night my sister, Dad, and I were all just hanging out and my Dad did or said something that was pretty cool so I said, without really thinking about it...""Awe Dad, ya got a little Dick in ya!""

To my horror, I realized just exactly what I had said and noticed my sister try to stifle her laughs while my Dad uneasily replied, ""Heh, uh yeeeeaah.""

"Me and a few college friends were throwing a huge party at some mansion in MD. So the party is in full swing with probably over 300 guests and I go over to the DJ booth to tell him something. On my way back from the DJ booth I trip over some cord which cuts the music off. It was like a scene out of a movie. Imagine a 300 college kids partying and then all of a sudden the music just stops. I swear EVERYONE turned to look at me. The DJ had the worst ""WTF"" look on his face. I could have died on the spot. What's worst was that after they fixed whatever I tripped over the DJ made an announcement telling everyone to stay away from the DJ booth. "
"My dad walked into my room without knocking right as I orgasmed. I panicked and handed him one of the Christmas cookies my mom made earlier that day, while cum was flying out of my dick that I had tried to hide under my shirt. He just ate the cookie and walked out again without saying a word.

It wasn't really an excuse but I tried covering up and I have no idea if it worked or not. He never mentioned it, he never said anything and he never started knocking on my door. "

"I had been kidnapped. Most of the time they would keep a big guy in the room and one or two outside. This time however the other guys had just left to get some food or something, and I was left with just the largest of them.

So there we were in a quite small room. He was quite into a movie on the TV while I sat on the edge of the bed fingering the pen knife in my pocket.

Now, the knife was too thin to stab with (quite long and sharp, but a really thin blade), so I was contemplating slitting his throat and getting out of there (hadn't really gotten a chance before).

In the end I decided to just keep cooperating, for several reasons.

1) If I hadn't manage to kill him, I would either be dead now or at least severely beaten.

2) As the guys were organized criminals (in a 3rd world country) it would have been much easier for them than for me to bribe the cops and I'd probably spend a long time in a bad prison.

3) I was at the time worth about 5k euro, and I figured I couldn't take a life for money, no matter the circumstanses.


When you fantasize about sticky situations, it's easy to think ""I'd would do this or that"", but when you're actually there it's completely different.

On a side note, the reason I actually considered taking a life was that I a few months earlier had dressed a potentially fatal wound and somewhere I thought ""wouldn't it be fair for me to take a life, as I've saved another?""
I came to the conclusion that no, it isn't. That brute had probably had a hard enough life as is.


Anyways; I've barely talked to anybody about shit like this (never told anybody in person I've actually considered killing another human being) and I've just gotten over the pts and depression and am currently trying to postprocess these things and get back in touch with my emotions.

If you want to know anything feel free to ask. It'd probably be good for me to talk about things like these.


**TL;DR: Actually considered killing a guy to get out of a sticky situation, made me rethink my morals.**"

I was crashing at a friends house after a night of drinking. She had gone to bed and I was watching TV with another friend in her lounge room. Her drunk boyfriend came home and went to bed. We start to hear slapping noises and moaning coming from the bedroom. My friend and I freak out because we don't know if he is beating her up or they are just getting kinky. We decide to go out in the hall and call out to our friend who eventually comes out crying because her drunk ass boyfriend had been slapping her around. I called my boyfriend to come pick us up but unfortunately could not convince my friend to come with us. They stayed together for a while but thankfully she eventually got the courage to leave the jerk.

"About a year ago, I was at a research symposium where everyone got funding.  I was sitting in a shuttle with a bunch of other students driving back from a day of research.  A PhD student who was an obvious lesbian was driving (it was also mentioned on her online profile).  This was in the Southern US by the way.

Two students in the back started telling gay jokes that escalated and got worse and worse.  Normally I wouldn't give a shit.  Like if I'm with friends, we all know we aren't being serious and have no problems being assholes because we know it's all in good fun.  But when someone who's an obvious lesbian is giving you a ride, for free, at a symposium you didn't pay for that also happens to be highly professional, it's in really bad taste.  I didn't want to make things awkward by telling them off so I distracted them by telling long, corny, Norm MacDonald-like jokes until the shuttle finally got back to where we were staying.  I'd like to think she noticed what I was doing and that the gesture made her day."

It was about 2am and most of the folks were asleep though. I got the driver to stop, borrowed 3 bottles of mineral water, got out of the bus into no-mans land, emptied my bowels and got back into the bus.

Fuck it, just because the weather/food was shitty and upset my body, I'm not going to feel bad about it. I'm proud I did the best in that circumstances. In my mid-to-late 30s and IDGAF."

So I'm standing there holding out a receipt to them and they're both staring at me, and by the time I realize what's going on it's too late to just walk away, so I just slowly put the receipt back in my pocket and say ""can I pet your dog?"" The guy said ""no"" but the dog was already licking me so I just kind of pet him anyway and then the guy said ""whiskey"" and I was like ""what"" and he said ""the dog's name is whiskey"" and I said ""oh"" and then walked away.

"I've passed out in public, especially school or family outings, a lot ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasovagal_response ). 

One time me and my friend rode our bikes to Walgreen's that was a little over a mile from my house. It was summer in the Midwest so hot and humid. I felt okay when we got there, and I honestly don't remember what we were even there for, but as we were standing in line to check out, I started feeling sick and had to sit down (I was getting the black spots in my vision). I ended up throwing up instead. I'm a little hazy on the details because I was sick and it was like 10 years ago, but a woman let me use her cell phone to call my dad, who took off work to go get me. But immediately after I called, my friend told me he couldn't wait and had to go home, so I had to sit there, feeling HORRIBLE and embarrassed, just hoping my dad would get there soon :(

Not the worst thing to happen, but for a 12/13 year old girl it sucked"
"> first of all my english isnt the yellow from the egg

we had a festival in our city for 3 or 4 days and i and my friends decided to go there twice, one the first and last day.

to come to the festival there was a bus line trough all our villages to the city just for the festival.

First day: nothing special happens, **BUT** when we were on the way back home in the bus, i saw this awesome pretty girl (*i had the feeling i know her*) sitting next to a good friend of me (he has a girlfriend, he just was sitting there cuz there was no other seat).
i dont know why i did this but, i wrote him a message on his phone that the girl next to him is pretty attractive to me.
i dont know what i expected but when he has read my message he istantly started talking to the girl for like 10 seconds and then pointed with his finger one me. i was so shocked in this moment i didnt know what to do, then he stand up came to me and said we can switch the places.

*my mind was like: wtf is this really happening*

then i was sitting next to her dindnt knew what to do or ask (im so shy..) and she just looked out of the window..

my buddy wrote a message to me: ""TALK TO HER OR I WILL HURT U"" (or something like that)

i cant remember what i was talking to her but we talked all the way until i said i have to go out on the next stop.
i noticed she was a bit frustrated as she heared that.
so i thought its the best moment to ask her for her phone number.
she gave me her number :) - pretty nice moment
then i huged her and said i hope to see her again pretty soon.

when i was out of the bus i noticed: damn my phone, i droped my phone in the bus, damn..

i asked a friends girlfriend if she knows someone in the bus, she knew the girl i was sitting next to :D
so she got a call and took my phone with her.
next day (after facebook friendrequest and some messages i was allowed to drive to her and take my phone)
so yeah i went to her to take my phone and just thought, damn come on dude ask her if she wants me to stay a but longer otherwise she wouldnt have taken my phone with her.
i asked, she denied, i felt horrible..

between first and last day of the festival she wrote me.. (i didnt text her i was to shy after what happend i thought she dont like me really that she just was nice to me, but nothing more so i dont wanted to disturb her)
so we texted a bit, not much just some unnecessary things and if she comes on the last day of the festival to see with me the firework. she promised it.

last day:
i was there again with my friends, with the know that she is also will be there.
fireworks started at 22:00
I drank some courage to me.
21:00 i started to write her where she is and if she wanna come :)
bad internetconnection if there are like 3000 people on one spot on a big bridge to see a firework..
i didnt managed to write alle information to her where i am on the bridge in a houre and was pretty frustrated cuz the firework started and she wasnt by me..
somehow, like a few minutes after firework started..
SUDDENDLY SHE STANDS next to me, i dont know how she managed to find me or even come trough this mass of humans on the bridge, but somehow she was suddendly there (later i asked her how she was able to come to me, she said: a bit luck and faith)

soo..

i was there having her standing beside me in my arms looking together the awesome firework. (and everyone around us started to kiss each other - ok may only the couples)
im a bit drunk and just thinking in my mind:
damn dude try to kiss her!
she seeked you trough this mass of humans only to be by your side, this is the moment, this is it, kiss her, KISS HER!

and so i took all my courage and tried to move her body front to my body front so we can kiss, but her head was like to refuse a kiss.
then i thought: hm she dont wanna kiss me`? NO DUDE KISS HER SHE CAME HERE JUST TO BE BY YOU!

so i tooked her cheek and moved it to me, suddendly i noticed how her eyes and whole body tried to refjuse the kiss and then i was like: ""THIS CANNOT BE, SHE JUST CAME FOR YOU""
and so (i dont know why) i didnt tried to kiss her but asked her to kiss her in the ear.

and she: looked frightened to me and said ""i dont know you really""..

> worst moment ever in my life..

> how many times i think about this moment and how i could have done it better..

As the night draws to a close, one of my friends mentions how he'd like to drive home since he's not that drunk anyway. My other friend snaps back at him and calls him an idiot. A big fight occurs.

Thing is, the guy doesn't even own a car, nor does he have a drivers license. I watched two of my best friends fight over something idiotic that didn't even matter at the time."

It turned from anger to discussing all his problems and emotions, eventually with all three of them crying and talking about how they are going to help him get better.

"Went to stay with a (then) friend in Boise, Idaho for 2 weeks. I had met her months before and she was pretty cool... but either something changed, or she was just putting on her best face when we met.


It started right away, she had a fucking problem with everyone and everything and was not afraid to criticize openly. She even talked shit about her best friends behind their back and she bragged about how she used her companies money to buy personal plane tickets and such. 


I was stuck with her for 2 weeks. That was 2 weeks that I couldn't even recognize myself. In my own element, I am always ready and willing to call people out on their BS or defend others, but I would have been stuck and on my own in a strange land. So I had to grin and bare it. To this day I am dissapointed in myself. I feel weird about it. But, I learned never to visit people I don't really know and always have a backup plan or at least a little money saved to deal with what needs to be dealt with.


If I had done it right I could have told her how much of a fucking cunt she was all the time to everyone; how unbelievably stuck up and needy and then peaced out and explored Boise on my own."
"I was trying to get to the Knoxville, TN airport and my phone's GPS somehow interpreted that as trying to get to the Air National Guard base on the far side of the airport.

So there I am, staring and tapping on my phone while yelling at it in this giant SUV because Hertz is terrible about reserving cars.  I looked up to see one of the base guards pointing her M4 at me because I didn't hear her tell me to stop.  She was nice enough to not pull me out of the SUV and let me turn around and be on my way.  

A year later I did the same exact thing in Alabama.  "

"I was unsuccessful finding a job right after college so I had to move back home. My parents were helping me move. Background: while at the parents', my mom goes through all my stuff, no matter how much I ask her to stop invading my privacy. The locks on our doors have skeleton keys and mom of course, doesn't think twice to use them. So of course, I had to throw out some of the stuff I was definitely not taking home, like my vibrator. I threw it out the night before, then my parents came over the next morning.

Dad and I start moving things and mom stays up (fifth floor, no elevator) to clean for inspection. I had left some stuff out that I was going to toss because we didn't have room in the car, and she decided to take it upon herself to go through and find what was useful. So I come back and apparently she'd decided to go fishing through *my trash*. I kid you not, my mother decided to look through my trash can, and what do I see in her hand but brandishing the vibe. Immediately I told her that I threw that away, it was *in my trash* what the fuck, and she said, ""yeah but it looked useful what is this?"" And then *turned it on*. I have no doubt that my mom is actually that sheltered that she had no idea what she was holding... she's the type to tell me not to use tampons and allude to the fact that they'll tear my hymen, except she is too embarrassed to even come up with a euphemism for hymen. Anyway, she continues with: ""Looks like it still works first_quadrant! Why did you throw this out if you don't want it can I have it? Why are you making that face haha!""

I'm pretty sure at least dad knew and then he told my mother to throw it away and *stop looking through my garbage*."
"My pretty conservative friend asked to borrow my phone to look something up and as I hand it to him I open safari and say ""here, use safari because chrome isn't really working."" He immediately closes safari and opens chrome where he gets a great look at the porn I still had pulled up. He says ""woah...uhh...that wasn't what I was looking for..."" And puts quickly hands my phone back to me. I tried to come up with an excuse but we ended up just sitting there trying to avoid eye contact and both of our faces were bright red. It was awkward and we both tried to awkwardly laugh it off. Eventually we pretty much got past it but it was SUPER awkward at the time. Yes I should've closed out of my porn before handing the phone to him but I honestly couldn't remember if I had closed out of it or not and decided to play it safe and have him use safari rather than check if it was there in front of him.

When I told Walter I fucked Ted.
"I have so many awkward, uncomfortable experiences I've stopped cataloguing them. I could write an encyclopedia just detailing my awkward moments. So here's a recent one that's still semi-relevant as a motivator:

I've been considering getting back into the dating scene for a few months now. About the time I started considering it and keeping my eyes open for opportunities, a couple of my friends went out of town and let use their house for a small party. It was cool, and I showed up really late because I was seeing other friends for possibly the last time before they moved to Europe.

So I get there and there are two people I don't know - cool, new friends. One turns out to be my friend's girlfriend, the other was an unattached lady. I chatted her up a bit, decided I liked her. We're all drinking - and she's significantly drunker than I. We go inside, sitting on the couch, she's between my best friend and I, but practically in my lap and hand nearly on my junk. Now I wasn't going to do anything or let anything happen, but in my mind these were signs that she was interested. I don't think I was making bad assumptions here. She starts whispering in my ear about how hot my best friend is...

I was kinda disappointed - but it's not like I had any expectations. I just let her go on about it while I subtly disentangled myself from her and went back outside. She passed out, my best friend joins us, and we sat and drank and talked on the deck until the sun came up. At some point I went inside and adjusted the woman so that she was laying down, gave her a pillow and a blanket and put a bottle of water next to her.
 
Later on find out she was looking for someone to hook up with, not just for the night - but that ship has done sailed. She missed out. Sucks for her. Me? I got a date Saturday so wish me luck!"
"Probably not the most uncomfortable, but at least the most memorable involved a friend of mine at a lan party. 

We were at said lan party celebrating a friend going off to Vet school. It was at another of our friend's condo, and there was 7 of us there. Friend X wanted us to play CS: Source, but Vet school friend wanted to play Heroes of Newerth. So we agree to play Hon for a while, then do CS. We do 2-3 games of Hon, while friend X complains all night. Finally, we start playing some 3 vs 3 CS (7th guy was drunk, sitting and watching from the couch). Friend X is significantly better at CS than the rest of us, but a few rounds in a row he gets killed by random lucky shots. He is clearly getting angry, yelling, etc. Finally he snaps, yells an expletive, and punches his laptop screen. His screen is fucked, everyone is silent, and he is just sitting back in his chair staring at it. Then he closes his laptop, slips it into his backpack, and leaves without saying a word. We are all still silent for a few minutes, nobody moves. Finally the friend who owns the condo stands up, walks over to the door, and locks it. Cue long ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!"" discussion. "
"Probably not the worst one, but definitely pretty bad. Last week at work, I was going to microwave something and this lady was just standing there eating chips in front of the microwave. I just didn't understand what the hell she was doing. So I said, ""Excuse me"" and walked up to the microwave and opened it only to find food in there. 

I literally went, ""What the hell"" before she goes, ""Oh that's my food!"". I opened the microwave up while she was making her food. It wouldn't have been so awkward if she hadn't kept making awkward comments about how the microwave was really quiet and I could use it when she was done etc. Worst minute of my life. 

I still avoid eye contact with her around the office."
"Well, I had fallen and hit my head snowboarding (No helmet, stupid me) and I knocked myself out. I woke up in the ER. With my legs like spread open because the trauma people were putting in a catheter. "
"When this guy (whom I had no idea was interested in me because he kept talking about his interest in maybe 5~8 other girls to me all the time) bumped into me on a date with another guy. He started pointing at me and forced himself to laugh loudly and wildly. He was obviously fake laughing to whatever he thought was hilarious.

Me and my date thought he was having a mental seizure or something. I'm sure it was more awkward for him than for us because he just stood there and fake laughed by himself for something like 1~2 minutes or so."
"Back at my old school we had a programme where sixth formers (16-18 year olds) helped out year 7s (12-13 year olds) with their reading. I sat down next to friend who was reading something with another markedly short guy. I said 'Oh, is this your reading buddy?' very enthusiastically. 'Nope, he's in year 13.'

And then because the library was silent, the awkward silence expanded into a black hole of awkwardness that engulfed the whole room and of which I was the centre. "
"My girlfriend at the time took me home after a night of hanging out with friends. We get to my driveway, she turns off the engine, looks at me and says:

**I don't love you as much as you love me.**

No context, nothing before that, she just dropped that bomb on me.
"
I fell off the chair in middle school and took the desk with me. Refusing to believe the unfortunate situation I was on I closed my eyes and tried to wish it all away. After that I'm sure everyone thought of me as a special kind of stupid.
"Not my most awkward, but here goes. I was on a cruise ship and was walking around with my cousin, we were both probably about 10. There were these huge glass bubbles that served as the roof of some jacuzzis that were a deck below. It was probably about 11 PM at the time, and I decided to look down through the glass just to see what was down there. In the jacuzzi was a guy and a girl getting it on. The guy was faced upwards. I was surprised so I did a double take and I looked straight into that mans eyes as he opened them. We were there for about a second before I broke off and pretended not to have made eye contact with a guy having private sex in a hot tub."
"One of my uncles married a post-op transgender woman who most of us had figured out is trans even though she never said anything about it. While sitting outside at a family gathering, a nephew of mine who was probably 6 or 7 at the time suddenly turns to my brother's gf and asks ""{name}, why does {transgender aunt} look like a man?""

Said aunt was sitting maybe three feet away.

"Maybe three weeks ago I walked into a room with 5 super hot chicks, I'm talking all between 8-9/10 (the person I marry will be a 10). And as I walk in I say ""hey ladies"" making strong eye contact with one of them directly in front of me, and whilst saying this I kick my foot on the ground. My foot sort of hits the ground twice emitting a loud farting noise. I'm in shock for a split second as they ignore the sound, then i said ""tha…that..tha was me..mi..my"" instead of completing the sentence I lost all my words, and gave up. They all looked at me weird and what followed was an excruciating painful minute of silence.

thats the only experience thats stuck in my head, as my mates always bring it up "

"Probably to late... but... i puked myself.

One night i was drinking a lot... i got home just fine. Then i went to the bathroom to pee. I woke up after i fell asleep sitting on the toilet and i have puke everywhere. It was a nightmare. Of course, i didnt want to tell my mother or so, so i cleaned everything up while i was drunk, tired enough to fall asleep any time and that at about 5am.

It was just horrible to clean the puke out of my underwear, my jeans, the carpet and stuff.... but...  i did it. And as far as i know, she never knew."

I really hope things pick up for you and that she's not too awful to you in the meantime."

"Hahaha...I did the same kind of thing in high school.  I had been talking to this guy that I had a crush on, but he had a girlfriend.  He told me he liked me, but I told him that I didn't want him to break up with his girlfriend because she was really mean, and I didn't want her to start talking about me and being awful, so I just told him that we didn't need to talk anymore.  I had gotten a shirt from Gadzooks a while before this happened that read ""Your boyfriend likes me"", and I (unintentionally) wore it to school one day.  She saw me walking down the hallway, read my shirt, and her face immediately contorted into this look of rage that was horrible, and I realized what I had done.  That was awkward."

I'd ride there in my buddies nova we just finished dropping a new tranny in and she wanted to see it. We go out, I pop the hood and show her what's going on. Turn around and she pushed me against the car, grabs my face and kisses me. Mind you, this is what sober me wanted. Drunk me, not so much.

I grabbed her arms, got up, moved her back two steps. Kept a total poker face then booked it straight into the house and passed out on the coffee table.

I never heard the end of it. She left that morning too. Opportunity was golden and drunk me is an idiot."

I like Star Trek, but would never go to a convention. I thought it'd be fun so I went. We would be staying at one of her relatives' house. I cannot remember the relation, but it definitely wasn't aunt or uncle. We get to the house kinda late and the owners are not home. My friend is tired and goes to bed early (like 9) and I start playing a Star Trek movie (of course). Then the owners come home and I realize how awkward this situation is. A complete stranger just chilling watching a movie that is friends with a distant neice or cousin or whatever? Super awkward. I ended up talking to them for a bit and practically running to the bedroom to sleep. "

"Oh dude!! Your story reminded me of my most awkward moment ever!

I was around 12-14 years old and right in the middle of one of the Harry Potter books. My mum had also started the series and she was up to the same book as me, so I would lens it to her to read.

So one night, the family have all gone to bed. It's been a little while and I realise she hasn't given me the book back to read. So I walk next-door to my parents room. Knock and walk in ""sorry guys but I'm just after the book..."" And there they are. Jumping apart and pulling up the sheets.

We all stood there like deer in the headlights for what felt like an eternity. Then I walked over, picked up the book from the nightstand, said a loud ""Just needed my book. Goodnight"", and closed the door.

Then I proceeded to take my mattress and blankets and set up a bed in the kitchen, being the furthest point away from the bedroom, making sure to close every door on the way over.

I had forgotten about that night. Oh man. Classic times."

When I was twenty-eight, I hiked the Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico to Canada.

"I'd like to think that I've done a lot of adventurous things in my life (sky diving, parties, road trips, traveling to different countries, etc.) but looking back, a lot of my favorite memories are of the little things.

Going to the park to read and paint with my friends.  Trying to make a key lime pie for the first time and *failing miserably*.  Sneaking screwdrivers into the library while pulling wrapping up a major project. Getting ordained with a friend one night on a whim.  Driving to a bunch of different restaurants in town to see who made the best soup. Pulling an all nighter with my roommate trying to create a new language for fun. Deciding to get a piercing for the hell of it with my friends after a lecture only for the piercer to use the the totally wrong gauge (that was fun). Book swaps, show exchanges, etc. etc.

For me, a lot of my best memories were filled doing things that I had never done before with good company.  I'm still in my early 20's and I know that a lot of the people in my life that I've made memories with now probably won't be in my life when I reach my 30's, but I'll always remember the sounds of their laughter and the way they made me feel. 

That's the point of life, at least in my opinion.  Be kind, find solace in the mundane, and do what you can to find peace and happiness in a day no matter how big or small it may be.  You haven't wasted any time; you've just been experiencing twenty six years of life in a different way and on a different timeline than those around you."

Travel, travel, and travel.  I know it's hard with COVID crap, but if at all possible, please TRAVEL.

In all seriousness I'm lucky I made it through that phase of my life without doing any serious damage (like an overdose or STD) or getting in trouble with the law. While I don't really regret any of it, I would urge anyone indulging in such a lifestyle to be extremely careful to keep themselves safe (ie harm reduction)
Fast forward to now and  I'm a boring married dad with a mortgage and a career, so those days are long behind me, but goddamn those were a fun few years."

"There was an all day / all night D&D marathon game involving some close friends, lots of pizza and plenty of alcohol.  I don't remember much but I remember a lot of laughter.

* Got a cool scar from a car built by engineering students in the Mojave desert at Mad Max fest.
* Lost a thunderdome fight at that same Mad Max fest.
* Worked at a bdsm dungeon.
* Did slam poetry at open mic nights (and got stupid drunk with my fellow performers, who are now life long friends).
* Learned to play a few new instruments and wrote a bunch of music.
* Got free drinks for cleaning up after witnessing a bar fight (smashing someone across the face with a full drink will get you kicked out of a bar, but being the guy who cleans up after that event will get you a good relationship with the bartender).
* Quit a miserable job after way too long (nothing will ever feel as good as leaving a place that treats you like shit).
* Had a lot of one-night stands/made out with a lot of strangers. (Not the safest decision, but I made a lot of good friends and I had a good time. Just remember to get tested regularly and take birth control if you're into that.)
* Got free drinks for going to a western bar on veterans day for karaoke in my full punk regalia (I had a 7 inch mohawk at the time), and singing Johnny Cash. (I'd like to believe it was because the rendition was good, but based on the shocked faces I think it was more the novelty, lol.)
* Got lost in San Francisco in the wee small hours of the morning on the best date of my life.
* Made friends with a Hungarian man on a 14.5 hour Greyhound to Seattle, who gave me a massive playlist of music from all over the world. (We never met again, but I still listen to that playlist on occasion.)
* Crowd-surfed into a mosh pit and stayed there.
* Fell in love. Got my heart truly and utterly broken. Still don't regret a thing.

In the words of the great John Darnielle, ""do every stupid thing that makes you feel alive""."
"25 here and I know how you feel, I was a homebody, friendless shut in before the pandemic and I never thought my lifestyle would be the thing that drives me crazy.

The one thing I miss more than anything is crowd surfing. I've only done it 2 or 3 tines and its by far one of the most exhilarating things Ive ever done, and that includes snorting coke 🤣

Something I wish I could do more is party, but not for the sake of getting messed up. I just love being around people, meeting and talking and even just existing in a room full of ebbing bodies. Probably why I like concerts so much too. I wish I would have known Id be locked in my house for months, I would have forced myself to go out more even though I dont know anybody."
"Music festivals, edm festivals and raves. I go to maybe 8 festivals a year and a lot of shows. I have travelled out of the country, all around the states, met lifelong friend and gone on adventures like hiking, seeing national parks and whatnot that I wouldn't have otherwise done if not for the road trip. 

I'm in my late twenties and don't plan on stopping."
Improv classes!!
"Drinking with friends and family, eating bomb ass foods, playing video games with friends, watching movies all day (lord of the rings marathon) or the full harry potter series even the matrix trilogy all in one sitting. Getting fked up at bars or friends house"
Doing mushrooms with my husband. Spending whole days in art galleries in different European cities.
"Glastonbury and Vietnam

ETA: getting cats and getting married"
"I was in the U S Army from 18 to 25, spend most of that time in Germany,  Northern Italy! Could really tell some interesting stories! Ofc this was back in the 1980's, lol🙂"
"Damn, I’m almost 29 and feel lame compared to everyone here. Riddled with anxiety and poor my whole life, therefore I haven’t gone out to experience much. A girl can dream though."
"1. Moved cities
2. Stayed alone for the first time
3. Changed jobs
4. Identified true friends
5. Finances on check
6. Explored dating area a bit more and got a clarity on what I want after breaking an engagement

Early 20s was fun, then covid happened."
Played video games almost every night with my best friends. Still doing it
"Extensive Travel!  
I went on an exchange semester on the other side of the world and traveled to 10 countries in 5 months. time of my life"
followed the Grateful Dead and learned mountaineering then moved to Montana..
"You want to slow down time, make the hours crawl by because time is flying?

Do absolutely nothing for a day. Or two. I mean, sit and do nothing. No phone, no TV, no entertainment or amusements. 

What you will find there is priceless."
Mushrooms and Campout music festivals
"Traveled to Italy, rented a Harley and drove throughout the country."
Solo travel! You learn so much about yourself and the discovery is amazing.
"I got pregnant with my son when I was 23, so in some ways I had to squeeze the ‘fun’ of my twenties in to only the very first few years of them, but at the same time, being a Mum has absolutely been the most meaningful and joyful adventure of my life thus far.

But I am more than just a Mother, and exist independently of my relation to other people, so. The other most fun things of my twenties: 
Dancing, at festivals or gigs or parties, covered in sweat, surrounded by my best friends and dozens of strangers, live music; feeling entirely embodied, myself, in the moment, and joyful. 

Travel- where even the most mundane of daily tasks (eating breakfast, buying a bus ticket, etc) is an adventure, and everyone you meet a potential friend. I’ve realised, as I’ve gotten older, that a lot of that sense of adventure, openness to opportunity, and wonderment can be carried over in to daily life at home, too. But, when and if you can- travel. It really is amazing.

Swimming with manta rays to the sound of whalesong in a coral reef- more magic than I can say. 

Sitting down and really enjoying quality time with my family, especially my grandparents; hearing about their lives, including the parts of them we wouldn’t have talked about when I was a kid. Getting tipsy together. Sharing meals. Coming to know elder family members as people, rather than only their roles to me.

Good luck, OP. May covid relinquish its grip on the world sufficient to allow all these adventures and more to take place before our twenties end (I am very shortly to be turning twenty-nine :O !) I’m aware most if not all of what I’ve listed (well, apart from having a baby i spose lolol) is currently impossible where I live cause of lockdowns, which is def a bit of a bummer. Love this question btw, and the idea of a Fun List ❤️"
"At 26 I sold everything and travelled solo to 50 countries over 4 years, before meeting my wife and getting married after knowing her for 6 months."
Reading
"Go through your dark night of the soul, wake up and find your life’s purpose."
"Having a near death experience..I am not joking. I'm not telling anyone to seek it out. I'm just saying when I accidentally had it, it robbed me of my fear off death entirely. To this day one of the most amazing experiences I ever had."
Taught English in Japan for a year when I was fresh out of college.
"I saw another poster say this, but most of my early/mid 20s I spent partying- bars, raves, friends, traveling tons (domestic and international) lots of casual sex, party drugs, etc. My fave memory was Camp Bisco- 3 day music fest with awesome music, friends, weed, and mushrooms galore! I’m now 37 (female), and I haven’t done any of that kind of stuff in ages! Heavy into my career and academia now. It’s not for me anymore, but I’m so glad I experienced it. I think many people jump into heavy responsibilities after college and end up having mid life or late 30s crises because of it!"
Honestly one of my favorite memories from my 20s was running around with all my friends on campus jumping in leaf piles at like midnight. I have laughed or smiled so hard. It felt like we were little kids without a single worry or care in the world. I would highly recommend it. I’m now in my late 30s so I’m not sure it would be the same 😂
"I took my kid to Iceland, Denmark & Sweden. Had an absolute blast. One of our best memories together."
"Music-jams/sing-alongs, beach bonfires and film-making with friends."
"On my 20th birthday in 2019 I took acid, and later shrooms and a few other chemicals I ordered. That year was one of the most eye opening and entertaining year of my life.

I've since quit taking those as it makes the mind funky if you do it too much, but I'll never forget how amazing it was just to have that type of perceptions and how hilarious it was to look out my window, look at the trees and feel like they were looking at me too and I'd just laugh my ass off. Or when I was on 4-Aco-DMT and when I would try and roll a joint the grinder weed would appear to have eyes shifting around and that made me feel kinda bad at the moment

Without a doubt I'll experience greater and better things in the future, but 2019 will always stick out to me for how fun and goofy it was."
"Travelling, being with good & real friends, festivals, trying drugs out with ppl i trust and really good late night pub conversations. A lot of reddit seems to not like partying but honestly some of those moments have been my favourite moments in life. Also just want to say dont panic, 26 is young. Imo 26-30 are your best years, still young enough to get out there and enjoy yourself but also old enough to have a bit of beer money and a bit more confidence."
"Travel as much as possible! (Plan a roadtrip, backpack Europe, have a staycation…go small or go big!) 

Wild nights out with friends!

One night stands! 

Eat whatever you want!

Live music / sports / events!

Other less fun advice: ignore FOMO, invest in your future, cut out toxic people, family is who you choose, don’t stay at a bad job, trust your gut, follow your heart, believe in your dreams."
Road motorcycles across Vietnam and Cambodia with my brother
"I guess I’m kind of an adrenaline junkie and still in my twenties, but sky diving, jet skiing, universal studios/Disney (roller coasters), road trips, traveling out of US(haven’t don’t this yet), hiking, parasailing,  cliff jumping zip lining, white water rafting (on the list),and sand boarding(also on list)."
"Working hard on my mental health 

Spending time building relationships with people I want in my life long term 

Finding things that make me happy 

Cutting out family members and friends that made me feel like shit 

I wish I travelled more pre- pandemic but that’s out of my control"
Meeting my husband and getting married. I had my first kid at 31. My 30s are way more fun than my 20s. lol.
"Hitch hike across Canada and the United States. 

Play music in various bands

Join an a Cappella group.

Move away from my dad's place"
"Travelled in Japan for a month. It had been my dream and it was so worth it. Took me 2 years to save up for it. Whatever is your dream, give it your all, no matter what age you are."
"in addition to partying, in my late 20’s i started a business with my family members and it’s been the best thing i ever did with my self. it took sooo much work and hours and stress. but the payoff is freedom, financial security, and we’ve never been closer. i’m really lucky to have had both. but i dropped out of 3 colleges and felt like a loser through my early 20’s and had to really go through a self-improvement phase to get here. therapy, books, podcast, journaling, deep introspection that is often uncomfortable. that’s led to me being a better 31 year old than i would have. but i think 20’s are the time to take all the risks and do whatever your heart desires!"
College. But I do wish I was involved in student life
[deleted]
Travelled solo and lived/worked in south east Asia as an English teacher for a year. I was 22 years old. It was the best experience of my life!
"Travel is a big one but that’s been covered a lot - I actually travel more in my thirties (minus covid) because I can afford nicer travel experiences. I’m not much of a backpacker. 

I invested a lot of my 20’s into a handful of deeply rewarding friendships. I’m still friends with them today and life is sweeter because they are in my life. 

I learned to cook and taste wine. I went to so many amazing restaurants and cafes and wine bars and had so many memorable meals. When you are young, genuinely interested, humble, and curious about something, the doors open for you. People love being the expert and letting them be the expert is such a good way to connect and learn things you might not otherwise learn and be invited to participate in experiences you may not otherwise get. 

I went to Fashion week a bunch. That was a blast until it wasn’t :). I exited at the right time. But such good parties and friends and dinners. It really informed my sense of self and style and meeting all sorts of fashionable, creative people taught me a lot."
Explore. Travel. Take road trips. Go see what’s out there. I started traveling young and never stopped.
"Camping with a big group of friends every year. 10 of us. We'd buy cases of beer, unhealthy food and just have so much fucking fun for the weekend. Now I only speak to 2 or 3 of those guys. I guess life has a funny way of getting in the way."
Go to a bar and make friends. Sing karaoke if you haven't tried.
Lived abroad for a year.
"Sit with your thoughts and reconsider who you want to be around and what you want to become, are friends toxic etc 

Better now than later, itll eat at you"
I'm still in my 20s but the funnest thing I've had so far in my twenties has been skydiving. It was WILD. Also I'm a free spirit that just travels wherever I want and I don't regret that.
"Worked in England. Worked in Ireland. Backpacked around Europe. Had very few plans. Came back, moved out west to ski. Moved further out west to Pacific northwest. I hiked and walked the coast a lot with my dog. I was usually alone and could make plans at the drop of a hat. I drove long distances and went to see places. That all feels like a lifetime ago"
"I went on a holiday to the Great Barrier Reef, went snorkelling and helped baby turtles reach the ocean after they hatched. It was hands down, the best experience I've ever had. I got up and close with a green sea turtle. Saw stingrays and other cool tropical fish. Swam amongst coral, and even had a squadron of Manta Rays race alongside the yacht. If you ever get the chance to do something like this, don't hesitate."
Do everything once. If it sounds lame just do it.
"Hit the gym.
Maybe that makes me look like a Chad, but I went with friends, had some time to socialize with them and made some friends there as well. 
The focus on doing the exercises helped with anxiety and my body not only looked, but felt better, everyday physical tasks became easier...
I can list other reasons, but my point is made, besides that, it doesn't take that much time, one hour, three times a week and you're good"
Traveling through Europe... and going to concerts
Travel.
"Enjoying my college friends. The first memories that come to mind were how once a year we would all get together for ""24 Day"" and watch the most recent season of 24 that had just come out on DVD and watch it all in 24 hours. I'm a boring married 36-year old Dad now and all of my college friends are parents too and I never see them anymore and I miss them."
"Went on a working holiday visa to New Zealand, and used workaway to work and live in the Canary islands for a couple months! That was absolutely incredible. Like a lot of people have said here, travel. It's incredible"
"I worked a seasonal job at Glacier National Park that I found on the website Cool Works. The job itself was lame (it was in a gift shop), but the experience was literally the best thing ever. It’s been over two years and I still think about it daily. I lived in a big dorm house with 24 other employees, got so close with them, partied and hiked in this beautiful landscape. Even when we weren’t doing anything, we were just enjoying each other’s company in the most beautiful place I’d ever seen. It was at a time when I needed to find myself a bit and it definitely helped."
"Honestly this is going to sounds sooooooo lame, but.....

*Harry Potter Conventions* met the most amazing group of friends, traveled all around North America (am Canadian, most were in the US). We got pretty high up in the Fandom, so we're invited to other cons like Dragon Con, Comic Con, etc as VIP guest, sent down to both Wizarding Worlds for the grand openings on Warner Brothers dime..... and if you know anyone who's gone to any sort of cons you know the parties are legit (similar, just less fashionable than festivals)

I had the unique experience of being a ""trendy"" person (worked managing high end restaurants/ night clubs) but would spend all my vacations parting with the nerdiest people on earth and they're honestly my best friends. My life at home and my HP life look very different

Honestly, your 20s are for figuring out who you want to be and being truly free of serious commitments. For living life without regrets and truly only for yourself (assuming at 1 point you'll want a partner and possibly kids) however make sure you start saving for your future!"
"Learning a few things that are productive, ie. Cook. I love cooking. Learned to fix my bikes and ride bikes. Pick up a guitar, read some books. Giving back like helping homeless shelters and such has been very rewarding. 

But besides that I can second the travel, music festivals, pacific crest trail, drugs but take it easy, finances finances finances.

I do wish I'd of bought a house in my early 20s, id be sitting on nice money now. Nowadays the housing market is shit so its not as feasible, but I didn't care about settling down or owning property when I was young. Not a bad thing to be in the moment, but planning ahead would've been beneficial."
"Travel, but don’t take out a bunch of debt to do it. A lot harder to do when you have kids."
[deleted]
Fucking lmao
Nothing 😅
Meeting up with friends for some Dancing and social drinking. Going to concerts.
"Work and grad school.

Long story short here - I really don't enjoy going out.  But I love doing stuff.  Any stuff.  One thing I discovered was that I was a pretty good DJ with a super eclectic taste in music.  And that translated to being a DJ in bars in Chicago. So what did I do?  I worked in bars (the late night bars too) and I had a ball.  I also learned a ton.  But that's a different story. 

And then, Saturday morning, I dragged my butt out of a really comfy bed in a small apartment and attended my MA classes. 9A on a Saturday morning.  I was tired but I loved it because I felt I was accomplishing something.

Maybe a few concerts now and then ( Fishbone, Rollins, TMBG, Sugar, etc.) but work and school. It really made me feel like I could do anything. 

To me, that was enjoyable."
Hiking/ camping with the boys.  Music festivals / live music. Bicycle rides with friends.
Spending most of it in the constant pursuit of hedonism with very little responsibility
"I love music, and I went to MANY rock shows. At least 1 a week. Rarely anything pricey. Mostly bars."
"Travel, for sure. Across the US, throughout Europe, and I regret not traveling more. And, starting a retirement account and throwing in as much as I could. Starting early with retirement makes a huge difference."
"In my 20s I got so fortunate to be able to live and travel in many many places, will be forever grateful for this."
"These are awesome!  

26 here and recently quit my job and started yachting. Just finished up cruising the med (Spain, Italy, France, Croatia, Montenegro) and am about to cruise back across the Atlantic. The parties/adventures I’ve had and people I’ve met have been incredible. Probably going to take the money I made hop on a sail boat and head west for some good surf in South Pacific! 

Stealing some more of these as well!  Good question OP"
Solo travel and clubbing.
"Did a last minute flight to Chicago and explored a small part of the city. It was insanely cold and I thought I was dying, but it was special"
"I quit my job that I hated, got a teaching certificate, and worked in Southeast Asia for 2 years. It gave me time to explore, travel, and meet a ton of lgbtq people that helped me unpack my internalized homophobia and come out of the closet 🤗 it was way less working hours that the 9+ hours i had at my US job which also gave me time to think about what I really wanted to do with my life.


After the 2 years I did my Masters in Scotland in Global Health. I've been working in that field for around 4 years now and am approaching 30. Thinking of relocating somewhere with a lower cost of living outside the US and take some time to reflect and think about how to pivot on my career to be happier."
"Travelling by myself and making friends and memories around the world. Favorites have been watching football in London, beach parties in Ibiza,  skating in Barcelona, traveling through Asia, and coffee tours in Australia!"
"Teach abroad! A lot of people mentioned moving to other countries or traveling, teaching abroad makes that possible while being able to earn some money. I did it in Spain, but I know France had a similar program. There are places in South America like Chile that do it too. In Asia I’ve had friends go to Thailand, Vietnam and South Korea (they tend to pay more in Asia).

Sometimes you can apply straight through the government or if you want to pay a little bit more, you can through a program like CIEE. I did that my first year and it was helpful. I was supposed to go for a one-year program, and ended up living there for 4 years. I’m fluent in Spanish, got a master’s on the cheap, snd traveled all over Europe and met so many people. Best thing I ever did by far!"
"Not sure if this would be relevant here, but thought I’d give my 2 cents.
I got the chance to live in NYC for 2yrs in my twenties and it was an awesome decision. A lot of my friends thought I was crazy to do it but I haven’t regretted it once. My husband and I figured that if there’s one time to live in NYC it’s before we settle down and have kids and we couldn’t be more grateful that we did. We were able to do so much and get to see the museums, the plays, the parks and all the landmarks so often and the restaurant scene is unparalleled. If you ever get the chance and a job that pays decently, definitely consider!"
"Stopped hanging out with other 20 year olds and started hanging out with poets and 35-45 year old lesbians that went to places like the lumberyard and salty nut to play 90s music in a band and never had to worry about getting roofied, could be the freak I was always trying to pretend I wasn’t (ie: I rode a mechanical bull, and found a random tambourine at one of the shows the lesbians were playing and started playing with the band one night), got hit on and loved every minute of it, and have a really solid support system. Making lesbian and gay and trans friends should be on the list. Like you haven’t lived until you’re surrounded by people who are the embodiment of fucking stereotypes."
"Had an existential crisis of my own and went to volunteer with an ecology charity in Madagascar for 3 months. Living on a beach camp with the ocean at the front and wilderness behind. It's probably going to always be the best thing I ever did for myself.

In short, travel!"
"I moved to New York City on an impulse, because my brother had a spare bedroom and was looking for a roommate. 
This was back in the early 80’s, and NYC was sketchy af. It was thrilling! I met the person who I eventually married, and we had so much fun doing stuff together in NYC.
I’m in my 50’s now. I took many risks in my 20’s, few regrets."
Impulse travel overseas with a mate after we both graduated from uni and right before we started full time work / covid started spreading.
"Back packed Europe solo for four months and road tripped the US for three months.  Had a job for a few years where I lived in hotels all over the US for a few weeks or months at a time.  

That was all pre smart phone and I had no social media.  I wonder how different those experiences would be now.  Haha I literally made a FB when I got home from Europe because I was totally enamored with this Australian girl I met."
"going to a place and living for 3-9 months.  The more foreign the better.  I did Shanghai, Ecuador, Maui, parts of California, New York, Vermont, Austin.  Ecuador is a cool memory but not great while I was there.  Shanghai was great while I was there."
Road trip with friends. No better memories and the ability to do something like that seems to get harder the older we all get.
Had a TON of sex with tons of people.
"I worked in the music industry. I used to get paid to put up posters and keep the vibes good at the show. I was going to events 4-5 times a week, meeting artists, making tons of friends. 

I ended up having to leave it all behind after a while, the venue I worked for got bought out and turned into a shitty basic nightclub and that just felt like a good time to go back to school. A lot of drama broke out in the social group I had built and it all just felt like time to start a new chapter"
"The little, absolutely dumb things I did were the most fun memories. The problem is that regrets often come with them; fun is rarely risk free. The smaller risks usually had the best fun to risk ratio though.

- staying up all night playing board games with strangers that are now some of my oldest friends, and getting the worst cafe breakfast in the morning when the sun came.up
- drunkenly trying to convince Mac as staff to make an off menu item (cheesy fries)
- breaking into the maintenance tunnels under uni and taking a tour
- midnight tea ceremony with strangers I met at a rave
- marching in Mardi gras parade

I would say aim to put yourself in situations where you meet like-minded people, at night, in groups, with a small amount of alcohol or drugs (omit the last part if you're already very friendly, open and comfortable ignoring social mores)"
"My friends and I got an Airbnb on the lake, stocked up on snacks and drinks and board games and movies, and spent the weekend together hanging out and exploring the local sights. I’ve done this a couple times in different settings with different friend groups and it’s always a great time and super affordable since we all pitch in. Also doing really kitschy touristy stuff like going to the Renaissance Faire, state fair, local festivals, and amusement parks is my favorite."
I just turned 20 so not much so far. But I started taking driving lessons for a motorcycle license and I forced myself to take an interest in things I need/have to do.
"I got married at 21, but before that I went to NY city with my best friend for a few weeks. Time of my fucking life."
Last week I went to Iceland!!!! Most amazing experience and now I want to travel around before I settle down and I would highly recommend it. No intentions on moving anywhere as I love my family but I know how difficult it is to travel once you have little kids and as a person in their 20s you have more freedom than you likely ever will
Go to prison.
Recommend passionate loving from a bbc
Your mom
"Being a line cook/training to be a sous-chef in increasinly high-end restaurants.

Full-on bonus life consisting mostly of rewarding hard work, late night parties and sweet, delicious pussy.

Finally bailed when too many people started depending on excessive rails of coke. Fuck that."
"Overseas travel, day drinking for events, a good nightclub & snowboarding with friends"
Music Festivals!
"I used to dance in the nightclubs of Chicago 4 nights a week until 4am. Chicago House music was at it's zenith and I had so much fun and so many friends.  I also never gained weight no matter what I ate. These clubs had the newest music and videos. Most of my friends were on X, but I never needed it because I had so much fun. Note: I wasn't a stripper, I was a nightclub patron."
Lots of…nevermind.
I am in my early 20s and i feel like. Well you know.
"Frankly my twenties were just years of struggle that ended all innocence I had from my teens. Most fun I can remember was pre ""adult"" era (before entering working world). Anything after that sucked."
Dungeons and Dragons
Work as a ski instructor for a season 🔥
I'll tell you in three years once I am 30
"Road trip's on the list! Thanks!

Uuh...what kind of pre-planning are you referring to? Hah."
"Yikes, I think I missed the pre-planning. And nothing and the stress either..."
Uhh what's the difference between pre-planning and planning?
"YOU HIKED THE PACIFIC CREST TRAIL? AHHHH this is my dream. Can I dm you about how you did it please bc as a 25 y/o woman I am terrified. I have traveled through Europe and Asia (not rich, just savvy) but even tho I’m Californian, I’m scared to take on this challenge. But it’s high on my bucket list."
So so cool. Already did some WWOOFING (WWOOFER HIGH FIVE!!) and adding long-distance hike to the list.
"I second the pacific crest trail as a HUGE life changing few months and beautiful experience. Just living out of a backpack, meeting people, getting into adventures. All the kind people you meet along the way are also incredible."
Did you find a job before moving? I want to do this but I don’t know what I should plan first
Yes!!
I’m honestly thinking about doing this next year. What did you find most difficult about it ? Would you do it again?
"Yep, current plans are to move to to Japan in a year, and I couldn't be more excited to just, be whoever I want to be. Gotta practice meeting new people until then though"
Lots of gems in here. Thanks. Also I’ve got a lot of love for your username.
How did you learn how to get your finances together? :) asking for me
100% focusing on the relationships that make you a better person. That has made a huge impact on my life
"Sounds similar to me.

Travelled a fair bit. For me this was the absolute highlight, and I think about the places I've been and people I've met all of the time. Like Jamie Foxx's character in Collateral when he looks at his dream island. Except I'm looking at memories of travelling. OP (u/ms_calculated), travel if you can!

Went back to university and changed careers .That's not fun though..."
This is a solid list.
">	Getting my finances together.
>	Traveling all over.
>	Changing jobs

Damn were you born in the 60s by any chance?"
This one might be hard without close friends
also drugs
This
Bonnaroo 😢
"You know what, I’m gonna add it to the list.
I’m happy for you - sounds like life has turned out great in this regard 💛"
This is such a beautiful reply - thank you!
Nice

Loving your enthusiasm!
"This, but be very careful of and constantly evaluate your relationship with said drugs. Your 20’s are usually extremely stressful and it’s very easy to depend on substances to forget about responsibilities and that can lead directly to a full blown addiction which if gone unaddressed can last your entire life. Obviously with hard drugs, but also pay very close attention to alcohol and weed, they can be very dangerous too. Moderation always."
"Remember those days before everything was possibly laced with fentanyl? I worry sick about the ""kids"" trying anything even casually because it seems like things are cut deadlier than they used to be"
"I never did this and am scared to become the boring dad without having scratched that itch, currently talking to a chick that is going down that route w me"
"Thanks! I think I have some more partying to do. Not the drugs, they just aren’t for me, and I’ve done lots of the casual sex, but I could definitely do with some more all-nighters."
"this is like my absolute dream, omg. i'm so jealous!"
How did you apply for this job? Sounds like a blast!!
GREAT list! Thanks for sharing. You sound like someone I'd love to be friends with!
"Hugs!! X
I added crowdsurfing to the list … never done it!"
Fun user name- just went to a anjunadeep event a week ago to see Ben Bohmer :)
Sweet!
Ah that’s a unique one! Can you elaborate a little?
"Fuck yeah, this list is great. The simple joys in life are the best."
Adding Glastonbury to the list. Got the cat already 💛

"I completely agree with you, my best memories from my twenties are from the different countries I lived in - exchange years, internships, work for extra money and so on. I think it broadened my horizons in ways I can't even appreciate, made friends from all over that I then visited in their home countries, learnt different languages and just had one hell of a time. It's much harder to do once you have a family/serious relationship and other obligations."
Yes. Moved to Montana. I wish I never left
"Thank you so much for your thoughtful reply, I felt a lot of joy reading it :) best wishes for you!"
so wholesome :)
That was the plan.

"Ah I’m sorry. I know life is rough sometimes, and sometimes more than just some times. Reddit hugs. 🤗"
"Mainly finances.  Basically the main reason I enjoy my 30s more is I have more money in the bank and make significantly more money.  That means more vacations, less stress."
There is charm and beauty in each phase of life
"You can pre-plan now :,) only time you can’t pre-plan: when dead :/ 


You got this!"
"Plan to plan, obvi."
"Heck yeah, I love talking about hiking!  Send me a message and hopefully I can help put your anxieties to rest."
"WWOOFer high five!

Even if long-distance hiking isn't your exact cup of tea, I hope you can get out on some sort of adventure where you feel the satisfaction of pushing your limits and you get to spend some time outdoors seeing beautiful places!"
I would also recommend shorter backpacking trips. The PCT is great but its a big undertaking. A week-long outing can be amazing and a nice break from the hustle and bustle of life.
"Idk your financial situation and what area you're moving to, but I've done this a couple times, and have friends who have done so as well. 

If you are 100% sure about the place you want to move to, the safest route is to save up as much money as you can to buy yourself time to find a job. Plenty of owner-landlords will be lenient if you are able to, say, pay six months up front (this is less true for property management companies).

The next best route is to save up enough for 1-2 months in an extended stay hotel or similar facility, and hustle to find a job. This will be more expensive per month, and it will be hard to get an apartment with only a month or so of local work history, but gives you an easier out if you change your mind.

Easy mode is using friends and family to network for jobs and housing, but I'm assuming you want a ""fresh start"" in a city where you don't currently have friends or family."
"Yes, and while it was harder to find one long-distance, it was worth it! Moving to a new place is already stressful, but having the job sorted means that you can focus on all the other stuff.

Like finding the nearest grocery store, figuring out where to get your hair cut, joining meetup groups to make friends...etc."
"I moved from Oregon to Florida last year with no job and found work at a target a few weeks after I arrived and applied for better jobs relevant to my degree everyday until I was hired a few months later into a better position at a hospital. 

For me the most difficult thing is being away from family and learning to do everything on your own. I’ve always lived alone and been independent but it really takes it up a notch moving away and especially far away from friends and family. Getting sick is hard, time zone changes suck, sometimes you’ll get lonely or home sick. 

But there’s a lot of growth and pride that comes with doing something like that. Many people say it’s brave and courageous but it’s scary and a big risk but if you’re strategic and do it for the right reasons it is a really amazing reward to be so independent and experience a new part of the country or world."
"Just gonna give my personal experience on this! I have moved away from home at around 20, it was difficult but fun! The only thing is I didn’t really establish myself at all in a career, I was instead sort of floating from industry to industry trying to find what it is I wanted to do with my life. When I turned 26 I moved back home and am now back in school. Once I complete my schooling I 100% plan on moving away again. It’s honestly nice being home because of the family and friends that are already here and never left however I do find that I just don’t really want to spend the rest of my life in the same place. Everyone is different and some of my friends are comfortable here and will most likely never move or leave. I just enjoy experiencing new things, meeting new people, etc. And I look forward to completing school and doing it again :) just wanted to give my personal experience! Hope it helps. Take care"
"How exciting!!

What did I find most difficult?

\-Making new friends. I have lots of acquaintances, but only a few close friends. I don't think that's uncommon as an adult though, so I can't say that's just limited to moving.

\-Finding new doctors that I liked (esp because I moved from NY to Oklahoma...I had to find doctors who were equally liberal/forward thinking/non-religious)

\-Understanding the new rules around car registration, licenses, etc. NY to OK was my second move, first I did NY to PA. Each state has different requirements, and no matter where you go, the DMV ain't fun

&#x200B;

Would I do it again?  
\-3,000% yes. I hope to do it again before my husband and I retire. That's actually the only reason I settled down in one place, I met my husband here. His work requires him to stay here, so we stay. But if I was still single, I'd probably be moving cities/states every 5 years or so. I like exploring new places!"
"Yes!! That's amazing, I'd love to live in Japan.

For me, meetup groups were the best way to socialize. I only made one or two long-term friends, but it was a good way to force myself out of my shell :)"
"Traveling is on the list 💛 I already have two degrees but they don’t seem to get me anywhere, so thinking about ways I can manage to do a third one. ( I’m European = tuition fees not that high = less insane than it sounds at first) - my thoughts re:career change."
Let’s book a trip to Coachella and munch shrooms until we ARE best friends
"If you down for an international adventure, shambhala in Canada brings people from all over the world and I’ve seen lots of ‘loners’, the crowd is super accepting and inclusive. You’d find your best friends in hours"
"Concerts alone are pretty fucking awesome too! 


Source: am 25, went to a RHCP, Rolling Stones, JBalvin, etc concert alone and had way too much fun"
"Honestly, solo travel is my preferred way to travel now! You're free to meet so many new people when you solo travel. You're more approachable in hostels and on group adventures. I went to a city somewhat nearby to test the waters when I first started traveling. Somewhere I'd never been before, but looked like it had some fun things to do and wasn't somewhere with much of a different culture/way of doing things. It made me realize that I could easily do this all over the world if I wanted to (and I since have!). If you're nervous about the idea I'd recommend doing the same. Start with something just outside of your comfort zone to get your feet wet. See how it goes!"
"Traveling alone is easy and freeing, as long as you xyz sensibly."
"I totally empathize with this. Unfortunately there is no other way to do it than literally just doing it. Maybe start small? Start by traveling within your city. Then another city a little farther away. Then another state or region. Then neighboring country. Then maybe other countries where you feel comfortable with the language, then a new country where everything is new :)"
Maybe you can find a tour to go with?
I appreciate this comment!
"Id be careful with the hard drugs, never really done them . But without a doubt psychedelics have opened my eyes and offered a refreshing perspective on life"
"The merch job? Just hung around enough that one day I got suckered in when their person didnt show up. The real job was just a file clerk at a law firm.

A lot of the bands I interacted with are no more, but the memories were fantastic. my favorite was teaching then unknown The Fray how to use their slider credit card machine, lol."
"Sure! I’m 28 now and from 23-26 I was in improv classes at UCB in NYC. The people I met were beyond funny, the experience really gets people out of their shell if they’re not used to performing or have social anxieties, and it’s all around fun!"
Ket?
It's never too late! 25 is so young  :) plan to do fun things soon!
Thanks Haha I mean I've done other things that are kinda interesting but reading is the thing I like the most :D
"Lol That's funny. Well, it's true though. It was frankly glorious. I remember that afterwards for a few weeks whenever I looked out of the window, I thought how grey and dull everything out there looked, compared to that experience. I didn't want to be ungrateful though, and now I feel appreciative of the beauty of life and nature again. But I know what I have seen, and I know it was real, at least for me."
Honestly I’m glad I can share memories that brought so much joy into my life and you enjoyed them too! Covid is hard but really (if you play your cards right) 30/40s is actually what society tells you your 20s should be.
✌️💪
"Uh, that part’s not going so well at the moment."
Tru this
"THIS. Seriously. While it was fun to just dick off any money I had and do whatever I wanted in my 20s, having money and being responsible with it at 28 (close enough to 30) makes a WORLD of difference in my mental health and happiness. I tell anybody and everybody to start being responsible with finances in your 20s. It’s a pain in the ass in the moment, but damn if it isn’t the most helpful thing."
What do you get out of hiking? From someone who doesn't entirely get the appeal but would like to.
"Thank you so much for this !!! I needed it. And I’m a senior med student, so I’ll be moving away to become a resident doctor, I’ll have a super stable job! :)"
"I highly recommend it, especially an out of country move. Doesn't even really matter what country. But if you're interested in Japan life, there's a YouTube channel I really like called [Abroad in Japan](https://youtube.com/c/AbroadinJapan) that talks about life there and just does some really cool stuff"
"Fuck yeah I need to meet people like you. I used to do weird and wild stuff in high school. Then I met a girl first day of college, she left me last year, now im boring old and alone."
My man
"Does your username have anything to do with Salvia Divinorum, perchance?"
"Is it still kicking?

Haven’t seen a “•Your Ideas Are Amazing•” sign in years... 

much less one held by a faerie..

Good times."
Can confirm Shambala is a wild good time!
Ahhh RHCP on the bucket list
YES for solo travel!
"Thank you! That actually sounds like something to try out because it absolutely terrifies me, but also sounds like a lot of fun!"
"I'm not the most athletic or competitive person, so it's an activity that I find physically fulfilling and I also like the way I get better and stronger at it as time passes.  In the same way, my abilities grow too.  The last long trail I did required a lot more route-finding and navigation than the PCT, so I had to face new challenges and push myself.

I'm a sucker for a good vista, too.  Long hikes in the woods don't do a ton for me (I don't think I have the patience for the Appalachian Trail), but I never get tired of big western mountain views.  Especially when they're the sort of places it takes a lot of work to access.

For me, the biggest things I love about long trails are the sense of absolute freedom and the goal-setting.  There's something really satisfying about setting a distance goal for the day, and then for the section that gets you to the next town, on and on.  

That's not to say there aren't parts that are scary.  My last thruhike involved some tough creek crossings, a snowstorm in August that trapped me in place for a day, and a few scrambles that were nerve-wracking.  But, in hindsight, overcoming those difficulties makes the journey feel even better."
Weird attracts weird bro ✌️👽
Get back out there brother
"Nope, it’s from a book"
You gotta do it! I can’t describe the feeling when your hear the drum stick hit drum cymbal and you just know Dani California about to go hard
how
