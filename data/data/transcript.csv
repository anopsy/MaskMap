0.0,4.62,"Hi, my name is Stephanie and today I want
to talk to you about autistic masking. I"
4.62,5.58,"was diagnosed with autism late, actually
at age 23, and this is the case for a lot"
10.2,2.97,"of females on the spectrum. And that's
because we're good at something called"
13.17,5.22,"masking. That basically means hiding our
traits and acting like others."
18.39,5.82,"While everyone masks somewhat, you know, in
public, masking for someone on the"
24.21,4.95,"spectrum is a lot more frequent and
takes a lot more energy. So, the problem"
29.16,6.62,"with masking is, well, one, it's exhausting
and two, it can kind of come off as"
35.78,5.59,"though the person who is doing it isn't
necessarily genuine. And that is because"
41.37,6.779,"we tend to, kind of, look and copy what we
see. So, we might think to ourselves, oh I"
48.149,6.0,"remember so-and-so doing X, Y, & Z in
a situation similar to this, and so that"
54.149,4.651,"can sometimes make us kind of come off
as awkward and weird because it not all"
58.8,5.88,"the time fits the particular situation
we think it might apply to. Or, a lot of"
64.68,3.81,"times, we're kind of opened up to
bullying because people will kind of set"
68.49,5.55,"a social situation up or a situation
with sarcasm that's not super overt so"
74.04,7.5,"we get made fun of and we don't really
understand why. And a lot of times we can"
81.54,3.509,"kind of mask and try to copy what
other people have done and it just"
85.049,4.381,"doesn't fit in the situation. So, I think
masking benefitted me a lot when I"
89.43,5.85,"was younger, and I guess even now. I was
pretty convinced I was fairly normal to"
95.28,6.449,"an extent and it wasn't until one of the
ends of the year in middle school that I"
101.729,4.35,"realized that I was the weird kid. Some
boys had come up and they were like"
106.079,4.32,"shoving another boy forward saying, oh
you like her, you like her. And he was"
110.399,4.65,"kind of, like, disgusted. And was like, oh I
don't like her. And the reason I know"
115.049,4.89,"that I was the weird kid was because I'd
seen the situation before, where there"
119.939,5.581,"was this boy and he was kind of weird
and he would, like, hug everybody every"
125.52,2.4,"single day or something. It was just kind
of weird."
127.92,3.27,"I don't know. So, the girls, what they
would do is they'd be like, oh you like"
131.19,2.37,"him, you like him. Just to get them to, like, freak"
133.56,5.01,"out and respond and that's what they
were doing to him but I was the weird"
138.57,4.59,"one. So, maybe I wasn't as good at masking
as I thought I was. I don't know. And I'm"
143.16,6.24,"not exactly sure that I'm all that great
at masking to this day and that's"
149.4,4.05,"probably because the different demands
that I experience in life can really"
153.45,4.08,"drain my energy. So, trying to put up a
little front and mask for people and"
157.53,4.71,"stuff like that ... it's difficult. But I
can do it for short amounts of time. So, I"
162.24,3.6,"try to limit my time with people as much
as I can, especially on Sunday mornings"
165.84,6.39,"at my church. Something about, like,
standing there, flailing your arms to new"
172.23,3.33,"people because you don't know what
you're doing in the situation is"
175.56,4.65,"probably a little bit off-putting. This
is where I really need trusted people"
180.21,4.41,"around me, preferably people who are
better at social interactions than, maybe,"
184.62,5.73,"I am. I've noticed that I tend to follow
people. Like, literally, physically follow"
190.35,4.32,"people, and also follow their actions. So
this can kind of get annoying to people."
194.67,3.8,"Sometimes, my husband's been kind of
irritated because I don't necessarily"
198.47,6.04,"take the lead, like, ever or go first. So,
like, for example in a buffet line, I"
204.51,2.82,"don't want to go first.
I want someone else to go in front of me"
207.33,4.08,"that I trust because I know that they're
gonna do, like, the right thing in this"
211.41,5.64,"situation. So I can copy them and do what
they're doing. I used to not really think"
217.05,5.28,"of that like, consciously. Like, oh, I'm
gonna watch this person as they do"
222.33,5.58,"something. But as time has passed, I've
begun to realize, like, if I am told to go"
227.91,4.26,"first, it flips me out because I don't
know what to do. I want someone else to"
232.17,4.41,"be able to, like, show me what I'm
supposed to do so I can just model their"
236.58,4.409,"behavior; I can just copy their behavior.
And when I first was looking at autism"
240.989,5.25,"or Asperger's, I didn't really think that
applied to me. I've read about, like,"
246.239,4.351,"behavior modeling and, you know, copying
stuff, people and masking and stuff"
250.59,4.92,"like that, and the way it was presented
was like, oh, they study others. And so in"
255.51,4.11,"my head, I have, you know, I had to have
like a pen and paper out like, oh, this is"
259.62,3.46,"what they do. That's
not necessarily the case for me. It's a"
263.08,6.899,"very unconscious effort, but when I lack
the people to see and to watch to know"
269.979,5.31,"what to do, it becomes apparent because
suddenly it's like I don't know how to"
275.289,5.401,"function in this space. I don't know what
I'm doing and it is very, very unpleasant."
280.69,4.409,"And with some people, when I got closer
to them, I would let them see my stims"
285.099,4.891,"and I didn't know that they were stims.
So, it was kind of interesting because I"
289.99,6.87,"thought that they didn't do those things
because it wasn't the right thing to do"
296.86,5.16,"in public, or something. Maybe it wasn't
very refined. So, when we were by"
302.02,4.829,"ourselves, like, and I'm, like, going in
circles or just doing things that are"
306.849,4.41,"kind of weird and out of the ordinary, I
legitimately thought that they were just"
311.259,6.331,"acting too good because I thought that
they did that in private. I thought that"
317.59,5.19,"they did that, maybe, with their close
friends or, like, in private or something."
322.78,9.3,"But they didn't. They, they don't do what
I do. And that would really strike me as"
332.08,5.369,"weird because I sincerely thought, like,
everybody does this, they just don't do"
337.449,7.291,"it in public. Unlike me, they are not
pretending all the time. They are not"
344.74,4.229,"forcing a genuine sounding laugh at
things that are quite frankly"
348.969,5.85,"unamusing. I'm sure people do that in some
settings, but I don't think that they do"
354.819,5.16,"it as much as I do.
They don't have to worry about, like, if"
359.979,3.511,"they're standing in the right place. If
they're in someone's way. If they're"
363.49,5.01,"bothering someone by the proximity. They
don't think about that stuff. They don't"
368.5,6.3,"worry about, literally, just how their
body exists in space with others, or the"
374.8,4.979,"next thing to say, or how to decipher
when people say ,hey, how are you while"
379.779,5.88,"they're walking by. Because it's a
question, so, I, I'm supposed to answer it,"
385.659,3.661,"but then they just keep walking and then
I'm like ... I guess you're supposed to say"
389.32,3.689,"how are you back, by the way. I think
that's how this happens. I don't know. My"
393.009,5.941,"response is usually, good,
what about you, because it's fast. So, yeah,"
398.95,4.08,"and it answers the question. And I don't
know, maybe other people feel this way,"
403.03,4.83,"but for a long time, I'd have to worry
about whether what I was saying was"
407.86,5.34,"being spoken too fast or if what I'm
saying is, like, boring everyone else and"
413.2,6.06,"a lot of the times I can't tell because
I'm way too wrapped up in talking about"
419.26,5.64,"it. But I feel like it's interesting to
realize that there are so many things"
424.9,4.79,"that I'm concerned about in social
situations that other people just aren't."
429.69,4.6,"They don't have to worry about, like,
hiding certain behaviors or acting like"
434.29,4.38,"so and so, because it's just natural to
them and it's not natural to me. So, I"
438.67,4.38,"thought I'd just share my experience
with masking with you all and hope that"
443.05,4.62,"that makes a little more sense to you
because if you were like me, it kind of"
447.67,3.63,"seemed to be like people had to
literally be, like, really creepily, like,"
451.3,3.63,"sitting in a corner, writing down every
movement someone made and that's how"
454.93,5.67,"they studied people and saw what they
did and copied it or whatnot. And that"
460.6,4.98,"also might be just a case of me taking
things literally. So, whatever. If you"
465.58,3.36,"don't have that problem, cool for you. I
hope you enjoyed this video. If you did,"
468.94,3.51,"go ahead and give it a thumbs up. Let me
know your thoughts in the comments below"
472.45,4.32,"and, of course, if you're not already
subscribed to me, please do so. I post"
476.77,3.63,"every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. So,
that's three times a week that you can"
480.4,6.71,"hear from me, and I hope you're having a
wonderful week. Bye!"

0.0,4.14,so how do you know if you're masking or
2.159,4.68,not let's talk about it if you're
4.14,4.44,watching this and you're a person who is
6.839,4.921,on the Journey of discovering your
8.58,5.34,neurodivergency or your autism you may
11.76,4.92,find yourself wondering whether or not
13.92,5.34,you're a person who even masks what your
16.68,4.92,masks look like and what aspects of
19.26,5.58,yourself that may be considered a mask
21.6,5.759,this question is a lot more normal than
24.84,4.92,you may think it is I want to get that
27.359,4.5,out there and give you guys some comfort
29.76,4.08,you're not the only person wondering
31.859,4.921,this this is probably one of the most
33.84,4.62,important questions that we begin to ask
36.78,3.779,ourselves when we are starting this
38.46,4.68,journey and on a lot of the online
40.559,4.261,autism forums that I'm on this is one of
43.14,3.54,the most common questions I see being
44.82,3.899,asked as well this is something I
46.68,4.5,wondered myself when I was starting my
48.719,5.34,journey of discovering my autism a lot
51.18,4.98,of people who may not be Autistic or may
54.059,4.441,not be neurodivergent maybe wondering
56.16,4.32,how do you not know your masking it
58.5,4.859,seems like something that you should
60.48,5.4,know because masking requires you to be
63.359,5.521,thinking about what to do within these
65.88,4.559,masks how to mask all that stuff right A
68.88,4.98,lot of people have this misconception
70.439,7.141,that masking is a conscious choice that
73.86,6.54,we make and are actively feeding into
77.58,4.74,and this is why it's a very nuanced
80.4,4.56,topic but if there's one thing we should
82.32,4.799,really understand about why a lot of
84.96,4.74,people out there may not even know that
87.119,6.241,they're masking is because a lot of
89.7,6.66,behaviors are unconscious if not most
93.36,4.619,Behavior patterns are subconscious and
96.36,4.32,let's kind of break that down a little
97.979,5.161,bit before we talk more about masking
100.68,4.74,Behavior patterns things like that
103.14,4.08,things that we do a lot of the times
105.42,4.379,especially when you're already a
107.22,4.7,full-blown adult are subconscious
109.799,4.381,because you spent a lifetime
111.92,5.32,establishing these Behavior patterns
114.18,5.399,right and so you get to a point where in
117.24,4.5,order to react a certain way in order to
119.579,4.381,do certain things even though it
121.74,5.28,requires not only your physical energy
123.96,5.159,but your mental energy as well it might
127.02,4.799,be so ingrained in who you are that you
129.119,5.821,may not even process it as masking
131.819,5.101,because you process it as just your
134.94,4.5,unique way of thinking it's just who I
136.92,4.56,am that's why it's important for us to
139.44,4.2,begin talking about the concept of what
141.48,4.02,masking is so that you can begin to
143.64,4.8,inject a little bit more awareness into
145.5,5.459,yourself so that the next time you react
148.44,5.22,a certain way or you have certain habits
150.959,4.92,come up you can be able to take a pause
153.66,4.68,and be like wait this one thing that I
155.879,5.64,usually do in certain moments like this
158.34,6.0,is actually me masking you could start
161.519,5.58,to see those patterns for what it is and
164.34,4.92,begin to understand what your masks are
167.099,4.92,and why you may be masking in certain
169.26,4.979,situations and this is why discovering
172.019,4.44,your autism as an adult is such a
174.239,4.261,profound experience because at this
176.459,4.381,point when you are a late diagnosed
178.5,5.58,person like me you've spent a lifetime
180.84,5.22,establishing yourself as a person right
184.08,4.98,I'm sure you guys can write a list of
186.06,5.22,your personality quirks but when you
189.06,5.22,learn about the neurodivergency you can
191.28,6.48,begin to understand what aspects of your
194.28,6.78,personality is attributed to autism or
197.76,5.46,ADHD or both of them so when I like to
201.06,4.56,think about masking and when I like to
203.22,4.08,explain masking to other people I like
205.62,4.38,to break it down into two different
207.3,4.98,categories there is masking and there is
210.0,4.8,also scripting these both go hand in
212.28,4.5,hand a lot of the times you can't have
214.8,4.14,one without having the other I am
216.78,4.56,currently creating a workbook just for
218.94,5.219,this topic of learning about what your
221.34,4.74,masks are and uncovering your mask so if
224.159,3.481,that's something that you are interested
226.08,4.019,in Click through the link in my
227.64,5.159,description box to my Etsy shop and you
230.099,4.92,could just for five dollars download
232.799,4.8,this workbook for yourself the goal of
235.019,4.621,my channel is not only to make learning
237.599,4.261,about your autism something that is
239.64,4.62,accessible but also something that is
241.86,5.159,Affordable because not everyone has
244.26,5.039,access to getting the help that they may
247.019,4.741,need it's just a part of my mission plan
249.299,4.621,to make these types of workbooks and
251.76,4.8,videos accessible to you guys it's also
253.92,4.379,about the honor System you know I talk
256.56,3.299,about this in so much detail in these
258.299,4.321,videos so technically you could work
259.859,5.041,through these on your own for free but
262.62,4.98,by going to my Etsy shop and paying that
264.9,5.22,five dollars to download the actual
267.6,5.159,product it's a really great way to
270.12,5.7,support a small Channel like me I put so
272.759,5.041,much time heart and energy and thoughts
275.82,3.54,into being able to make these types of
277.8,3.78,workbooks and this is something that I'm
279.36,4.5,super passionate about so you know being
281.58,4.679,able to actually like buy my product and
283.86,4.559,support me and what I do is a really
286.259,4.081,great way to just give back to me as I
288.419,4.56,give back to you as we give back to the
290.34,4.919,community and the cycle goes on there
292.979,4.681,are some precursor questions that I have
295.259,5.341,written down that we should be asking
297.66,5.28,ourselves this is where we can begin to
300.6,6.06,warm ourselves up into this type of
302.94,6.3,topic so as I ask these questions I want
306.66,3.8,you guys to answer back to me out loud
309.24,3.959,with the
310.46,4.9,aura the reason why I want this to
313.199,4.081,happen is because I want you guys to not
315.36,4.92,have to think too much about it and just
317.28,5.82,give your immediate gut instinct answer
320.28,5.22,are you guys ready
323.1,4.74,do I feel uncomfortable in social
325.5,4.38,situations
327.84,3.96,do I feel drained after social
329.88,5.28,situations
331.8,5.94,do I avoid social situations
335.16,4.68,do I need time to recoup after social
337.74,4.679,situations
339.84,4.62,do I need to know who will be at social
342.419,3.84,situations
344.46,4.079,do I need to know where the social
346.259,4.261,situation will be
348.539,4.621,do I need to know what we will be doing
350.52,5.88,at social situations
353.16,5.52,do I analyze how I was acting and
356.4,4.32,talking during or after a social
358.68,4.5,interaction
360.72,4.5,do I dread social interaction despite
363.18,4.2,how pleasant I come across on the
365.22,3.84,surface and despite how much I am
367.38,4.46,actually enjoying myself during the
369.06,2.78,social interaction
372.0,5.88,and the last question is would I act or
374.4,5.579,talk like this if I was alone
377.88,3.78,these are very important questions that
379.979,4.261,I think you guys should begin to think
381.66,4.56,about when it comes to whether or not
384.24,4.62,you may or may not be masking the more
386.22,5.039,you say to these questions I feel like
388.86,4.26,it is a high possibility that you are
391.259,4.22,masking situations that you may be
393.12,4.799,masking is in family situations
395.479,4.66,interactions with friends interactions
397.919,4.081,within work interactions within your
400.139,4.56,hobby interactions within your
402.0,5.66,relationships and interactions with
404.699,6.06,strangers so these are all social
407.66,6.039,interactions that may require you to
410.759,5.16,mask and to script and so when we begin
413.699,4.56,to think about what our masks may be
415.919,6.72,what they may look like it's important
418.259,6.961,to know which masks you use and rely on
422.639,5.101,in these different social situations
425.22,4.08,because how you mask with family may be
427.74,3.48,different with how you mask with friends
429.3,3.3,and how you mess with friends may be
431.22,3.419,different with how you mask with work
432.6,3.48,and how you mask within work may be
434.639,4.081,different with how you mask within
436.08,4.739,romantic relationships I've find a lot
438.72,4.379,of the times with autistic individuals
440.819,5.041,or neurodivergent people in general are
443.099,5.1,different masks are tailored towards
445.86,4.8,different group dynamics especially for
448.199,4.921,autistic individuals because we're
450.66,4.86,catering those masks to certain
453.12,3.9,individuals we're interacting with in
455.52,3.72,order to make the social interaction
457.02,4.619,more smooth and I want to take this time
459.24,4.26,to also emphasize that masking is not
461.639,3.84,just something neurodivergent people do
463.5,5.22,it's not something just autistic people
465.479,5.881,do everyone can mask even neurotypical
468.72,5.58,and holistic people so I don't want
471.36,5.88,people to think that just because you do
474.3,5.519,mask you cannot be neurotypical or
477.24,4.019,holistic and likewise I don't want you
479.819,3.421,guys to think that if you see a
481.259,4.56,neurotypical or holistic person masking
483.24,4.679,they now could be a neurodivergent
485.819,4.38,person you know that's kind of like the
487.919,5.101,complexity of all this is that these are
490.199,4.741,Behavior patterns and different ways to
493.02,4.079,process things and it's not something
494.94,4.379,that is just exclusive to
497.099,4.621,neurodivergence see and in that sense
499.319,4.981,it's important for you to keep educating
501.72,5.759,yourself on your divergency it's usually
504.3,5.239,a plethora of symptoms co-existing with
507.479,5.101,each other and so in that sense
509.539,5.201,neurotypical people can have attributes
512.58,4.379,of neurodivergency here and there but if
514.74,4.919,it's not all these symptoms coexisting
516.959,5.281,together that spans across their whole
519.659,4.5,life that is kind of what determines
522.24,3.719,whether or not you are a neurodivergent
524.159,4.141,person versus a neurotypical person
525.959,4.38,right because neurotypical people can
528.3,3.96,utilize masking in situations where
530.339,3.661,they're not necessarily feeling the most
532.26,4.5,natural or they have to be more
534.0,5.519,cognizant of their behaviors so for
536.76,5.519,example I would say most people would
539.519,5.281,mask to a certain capacity in work
542.279,5.341,situations because you have to have a
544.8,5.039,certain facade and professionalism at
547.62,5.64,work so now we could begin to dive in
549.839,4.68,deeper into the levels of masking I
553.26,4.139,break these down into different
554.519,6.0,categories authentic versus inauthentic
557.399,4.56,so how true to myself can I be sometimes
560.519,2.88,we may have the misconception that
561.959,4.56,masking means that we're not being
563.399,5.701,ourselves a lot of the times masks are
566.519,5.641,actually authentic to ourselves it's
569.1,5.88,just you're tailoring yourself to
572.16,5.16,respond a certain way look a certain way
574.98,4.26,but that could actually be an authentic
577.32,4.199,version of yourself so just because
579.24,4.56,you're masking it doesn't mean you're
581.519,4.201,faking to be another person it's just
583.8,3.0,the utilization of different types of
585.72,5.1,masks
586.8,6.599,the next thing is open versus judged so
590.82,5.4,can I be open and honest or do I feel
593.399,5.94,judged this will affect your levels of
596.22,5.64,masking because whether or not you feel
599.339,5.221,open with the other person or within the
601.86,5.64,situation can kind of determine the type
604.56,5.279,of masks that you are using and the
607.5,5.82,levels of masks that you are using in
609.839,5.401,that situation if you imagine you're in
613.32,4.44,an environment where you feel judged or
615.24,5.159,around a person that you feel judged by
617.76,5.82,your masks are going to feel a little
620.399,6.181,bit more inauthentic and the level of
623.58,5.819,masking may be higher because you are
626.58,5.58,tailoring yourself more to the other
629.399,6.0,person in order to not be judged the
632.16,5.22,next thing is new versus history so is
635.399,4.081,this person new or do we have history
637.38,4.5,this will also affect your level of
639.48,5.28,masking for many different reasons that
641.88,5.459,is special and unique to you everyone is
644.76,6.42,going to be different I personally find
647.339,5.94,that I tend to mask more when I meet new
651.18,5.64,people and I'm not necessarily used to
653.279,6.901,them but I actually do begin to mask in
656.82,5.579,a more uncomfortable way when I start to
660.18,4.56,get to know someone and build history
662.399,4.861,with them and I feel like the reason why
664.74,5.039,I do this is because when I establish
667.26,4.92,history with someone there's a lot of
669.779,4.921,complex social dynamics there that I
672.18,4.92,have to maintain with this person and I
674.7,4.56,know them a lot more and so I feel like
677.1,3.9,in a sense the masking with people I
679.26,4.259,have history with is actually more
681.0,4.62,uncomfortable to me because it's more
683.519,4.801,details within this mask that I have to
685.62,5.04,uphold that becomes tiring to me over
688.32,3.84,time just because you are comfortable
690.66,3.419,with someone or just because you've
692.16,3.72,known someone for a long time or been
694.079,3.061,somewhere for a long time that
695.88,3.78,automatically means you don't mask
697.14,4.8,anymore that's not necessarily the case
699.66,5.1,and the next thing is stable versus
701.94,5.579,sensitive so is this person stable or
704.76,5.4,sensitive this also affects the levels
707.519,5.401,at which you mask because if someone
710.16,4.859,tends to be a more sensitive person that
712.92,3.72,might make you need to mask more in
715.019,4.021,front of them and script more in front
716.64,5.879,of them because you have to kind of be
719.04,5.1,more cognizant of how they feel and how
722.519,4.141,you're affecting them you have to kind
724.14,5.04,of manage what you look like what you
726.66,4.859,say how you come across to them a little
729.18,4.86,bit more carefully I noticed that for
731.519,5.341,myself when someone is more sensitive I
734.04,4.56,have to mask and script a lot more and
736.86,4.5,when someone is generally more stable
738.6,4.44,and don't take things too personally I
741.36,3.719,could kind of feel more free to be
743.04,4.62,myself and say what I actually want to
745.079,5.521,say masking is not necessarily a bad
747.66,4.799,thing I do think like I always say in
750.6,3.6,all my videos it's all about balance
752.459,4.141,right when you have too much of
754.2,4.379,something it's not good usually a lot of
756.6,4.14,things in life are neutral things but
758.579,4.26,when it becomes unbalanced that's when
760.74,4.92,it becomes a negative masking for the
762.839,5.701,most part because it's utilized in so
765.66,5.1,many situations in which you don't
768.54,5.039,necessarily want to mask and it becomes
770.76,5.34,a draining thing it's seen as a negative
773.579,5.401,experience but masking could also be
776.1,5.58,very positive when you use it to express
778.98,5.88,authentic parts of yourself in order for
781.68,6.24,another person to understand who you
784.86,4.919,truly are more accurately if you utilize
787.92,4.02,masking to your advantage it could be
789.779,4.261,very very empowering I think what it
791.94,4.56,comes down to is whether or not it feels
794.04,4.859,like a choice to you are you choosing to
796.5,5.04,mask or do you feel forced into doing so
798.899,4.981,when it comes to figuring out your
801.54,4.26,comfort levels with masking I want you
803.88,5.1,guys to think about effort versus
805.8,5.039,success the effort you're putting into
808.98,4.039,your masking and how much you're
810.839,5.281,succeeding at that social situation
813.019,5.201,masking can affect your energy levels in
816.12,4.86,different ways it can make you feel
818.22,4.919,fulfilled and energized at its best it
820.98,4.919,could also burn you out when it's
823.139,5.76,becoming unbalanced and at its worst it
825.899,5.401,can even lead to meltdowns and so I want
828.899,5.761,to go into explaining the six different
831.3,7.44,scenarios in which I find people masking
834.66,6.96,the most and in which category does that
838.74,5.339,specific mask fit into the fulfilled and
841.62,4.92,energized category the burnout category
844.079,4.44,or the Meltdown category so the first
846.54,3.239,scenario is the best scenario this is
848.519,3.781,the type that will make you feel
849.779,4.261,fulfilled and energized right it's a
852.3,4.38,mask that feels natural to you because
854.04,5.34,it's authentic you're also in a scenario
856.68,5.82,in which you feel open and comfortable
859.38,6.24,so this requires minimal effort on your
862.5,5.459,part but the success is exponential this
865.62,4.74,is the best case scenario right because
867.959,5.041,you can mask have successful
870.36,4.86,interactions feel great about it feel
873.0,4.38,fulfilled and not feel drained
875.22,4.38,afterwards now we're going to begin to
877.38,4.199,ramp up the discomfort levels and these
879.6,4.08,are the types of masks and interactions
881.579,4.5,that may lead to burnouts this is a
883.68,5.099,scenario in which you feel nervous for
886.079,4.56,the interact action leading into it this
888.779,4.74,is usually when you have to be very
890.639,5.94,cognizant of your scripts and your masks
893.519,5.701,but once you're in the interaction the
896.579,5.101,nerves begin to dissipate and the
899.22,4.44,interaction is successful so this is
901.68,4.14,where you feel like somewhat of a
903.66,4.32,discomfort there it's not horrible yet
905.82,4.139,if you were to ramp up the discomfort a
907.98,3.84,little bit more it would be a situation
909.959,3.901,where you feel nervous before the
911.82,4.319,interaction and you may even feel
913.86,4.38,anxious and uncomfortable during the
916.139,4.26,interaction but you could at least feel
918.24,5.52,proud of the fact that the interaction
920.399,5.94,was successful the thing about these is
923.76,5.1,it's not horrible but if you have these
926.339,4.68,types of interactions too much it could
928.86,4.979,lead to burnout because you feel very
931.019,5.401,tired and drained afterwards even though
933.839,4.981,you do have successful relationships and
936.42,5.279,interactions so if we were to ramp up
938.82,6.18,the discomfort levels more these can
941.699,6.241,maybe lead to burnouts or meltdowns
945.0,6.0,so an interaction where you have nerves
947.94,5.339,leading into the interaction and you're
951.0,4.92,not even enjoying the interaction
953.279,5.401,ramping it up even more you're dreading
955.92,5.34,a social interaction but you have to do
958.68,4.74,it because it is necessary and
961.26,4.439,unavoidable as you can see the
963.42,4.5,discomfort level is ramping up because
965.699,4.561,you don't feel like you have a choice to
967.92,4.38,say no to these interactions there's a
970.26,4.379,level of forcing yourself right the
972.3,5.099,reasons why this is in the category of
974.639,6.361,leading to meltdowns is because you're
977.399,6.481,not only feeling exhausted by masking
981.0,5.04,Within These interactions but you're not
983.88,3.899,getting any sort of energy being fed
986.04,4.02,back into you there's no fulfillment
987.779,4.74,coming from it right the worst case
990.06,4.86,scenario is you're dreading an
992.519,4.62,interaction you're forced to go through
994.92,4.919,it it's not even a successful
997.139,5.161,interaction and it doesn't go well this
999.839,4.081,is a situation in which you didn't want
1002.3,3.719,to be in that interaction to begin with
1003.92,4.44,and once you're in it you find yourself
1006.019,4.081,misinterpreting the other person you
1008.36,4.44,find the other person misinterpreting
1010.1,4.859,you and maybe even accusing you and
1012.8,5.76,attacking you these are interactions
1014.959,5.88,that are very draining distressing and
1018.56,4.62,therefore can lead to meltdowns it's
1020.839,4.801,just not enjoyable all around it's not a
1023.18,4.739,successful interaction it honestly just
1025.64,4.14,like hurts you but other than that stick
1027.919,4.441,around and watch the video I made where
1029.78,6.5,I help you guys uncover your stems see
1032.36,3.92,you guys on next week's video bye guys
Start,Duration,Text
0.0,3.48,hi I'm Taylor with Mom on the Spectrum
1.86,3.6,and today I've got a fun little bingo
3.48,4.02,card for late diagnosed autistic adults
5.46,3.78,you can get your own copy through a link
7.5,3.66,in the description if you want to print
9.24,4.439,one out for yourself this is just for
11.16,4.62,fun it's not a diagnostic tool I'm not a
13.679,4.321,diagnostician I'm not a psychologist I'm
15.78,3.72,a late diagnosed autistic mom of two and
18.0,3.0,I'm here to share resources and
19.5,3.3,information to help other autistic
21.0,3.48,adults like me if that sounds helpful to
22.8,3.239,you please consider subscribing to the
24.48,3.24,channel and giving this video a thumbs
26.039,3.181,up and if you want to keep track of how
27.72,3.479,many you relate to as we go through the
29.22,4.019,bingo card I'd love to hear your score
31.199,4.02,in the comments whatever that means so
33.239,3.781,just to be clear even if you cross off
35.219,3.421,every single thing on this bingo card it
37.02,3.359,does not necessarily mean that you are
38.64,3.0,on the Spectrum I just have the
40.379,2.821,privilege of getting to work with the
41.64,3.72,autistic Community every day I teach
43.2,4.019,classes I hold webinars and I'm
45.36,3.66,constantly learning from others in the
47.219,3.421,community from my own experiences as
49.02,3.18,well and I've just compiled this fun
50.64,3.06,little bingo card so that we can connect
52.2,3.24,with each other about things that we
53.7,4.26,might have experienced together so first
55.44,4.32,up people pleasing Tendencies hello
57.96,3.779,absolutely I think that this can kind of
59.76,3.84,go hand in hand with masking somebody
61.739,3.42,told me before that they feel like an
63.6,3.9,antenna whenever they walk in the room
65.159,4.32,like they immediately pick up on other
67.5,3.54,people's emotions and the energy of the
69.479,4.14,room and I think because we're we're
71.04,4.079,used to generally speaking getting in
73.619,3.661,tune with other people and what they're
75.119,4.081,wanting from us hence the masking and
77.28,3.42,all of that I think that we've become
79.2,3.239,pretty good at people pleasing and
80.7,3.059,putting ourselves on the back burner
82.439,4.201,second one we're gonna go straight
83.759,4.68,across routines are sacred that's kind
86.64,3.479,of part of the autistic experience we
88.439,5.101,like our routines please don't mess with
90.119,5.221,them but if your Audi HD you have ADHD
93.54,4.02,too that's where things get interesting
95.34,3.779,because then routines are not so fun
97.56,4.019,third thing on the list trouble getting
99.119,4.201,into bed transitions can be especially
101.579,3.481,difficult for people on the Spectrum and
103.32,3.659,I've heard time and time again that so
105.06,3.96,many of us just get stuck like on the
106.979,4.561,couch before bed because that transition
109.02,4.86,going from the end of the day to the
111.54,4.8,night it's just really hard fourth
113.88,4.379,secret stems so stemming is any repeated
116.34,4.08,physical movement that we have that
118.259,3.601,helps us move energy that gets it's kind
120.42,3.9,of stuck in our body when our nervous
121.86,4.5,system gets dysregulated secret stems
124.32,4.079,can be things that we do discreetly so
126.36,4.679,that it doesn't like upset other people
128.399,4.681,so it could be picking at our skin our
131.039,3.84,hair our nails a lot of people tell me
133.08,3.72,they scrunch their toes in their shoe
134.879,3.481,because nobody can see that next one is
136.8,4.079,knowing more about others than yourself
138.36,4.56,this can be again kind of due to our
140.879,3.72,people-pleasing Tendencies we might know
142.92,4.679,what other people want and need before
144.599,4.981,we know what we want or need second row
147.599,3.481,listening to the same song over and over
149.58,3.42,I'm not going to say too much about that
151.08,3.299,other than if that's you let me know in
153.0,3.239,the comments which song it is for you
154.379,3.541,for me it's September by Earth Wind and
156.239,3.901,Fire second one on the second row
157.92,4.62,stomach issues unfortunately this is
160.14,4.8,very very common with people on the
162.54,5.76,Spectrum gastrointestinal issues dietary
164.94,5.1,allergies it's not fun but it's part of
168.3,4.019,many of our experiences kind of related
170.04,3.839,sticking to safe foods so if you're on
172.319,4.261,the Spectrum you probably have some
173.879,5.94,foods that have like safe textures that
176.58,5.159,always or almost always feel good to eat
179.819,4.2,to me it's french fries like sometimes I
181.739,4.5,have a hard time eating things with
184.019,4.201,different textures kind of maybe related
186.239,3.841,to our fit I have another video over
188.22,3.06,avoidant restrictive food intake
190.08,3.12,disorder if you're interested in
191.28,4.5,learning more about that but my safe
193.2,4.259,foods are french fries and this protein
195.78,3.66,bar that I've eaten like a million of
197.459,3.901,because it always tastes good to me next
199.44,3.659,one is triggered by light touch for
201.36,4.08,whatever reason so many of us on the
203.099,4.86,Spectrum get very easily upset if
205.44,5.28,someone lightly touches Us in any way I
207.959,4.681,need firm deep pressure or else last one
210.72,3.78,on the second row needing extra time to
212.64,3.54,process what someone just said delayed
214.5,3.9,processing is a very common experience
216.18,4.74,for people on the Spectrum someone told
218.4,5.1,me that their first response is usually
220.92,4.739,a script like a scripted response that
223.5,3.959,has become familiar and safe to them I
225.659,3.781,need space by myself to process
227.459,3.84,especially a bigger idea or something
229.44,3.78,important that someone just said outside
231.299,4.201,of a social situation where I can just
233.22,4.079,be by myself process the information and
235.5,3.78,then come back to the conversation third
237.299,3.481,row I can't hear you the lights are too
239.28,4.019,bright if you you understand what that
240.78,4.5,means X next one making a list and
243.299,5.041,immediately hating it this is more
245.28,5.459,related to the Audi HD autistic and ADHD
248.34,4.2,combination that I mentioned earlier I
250.739,3.481,make a list and I'm so proud of it and
252.54,3.479,it's beautiful and if I follow the list
254.22,3.299,all my problems would be solved but then
256.019,2.94,as soon as I make the list I hate it and
257.519,3.12,I don't want to do anything on it could
258.959,2.641,be related to demand avoidance if you're
260.639,2.881,interested in learning more about that
261.6,3.36,the one in the middle research mode this
263.52,3.119,is the one that's basically like the
264.96,3.299,free space because I feel like everyone
266.639,4.381,on the Spectrum knows what research mode
268.259,4.861,is we just like to learn a lot of times
271.02,4.44,I like learning about random stuff that
273.12,4.38,has absolutely nothing to do with my
275.46,3.48,life I'll just get fixated on the idea
277.5,3.66,that like I need to understand how
278.94,4.14,Bluetooth works or how to say something
281.16,4.2,in a different language that I don't
283.08,3.78,speak it like I just get fixated on
285.36,4.559,these ideas and these things that I want
286.86,5.339,to research like what's behind walls and
289.919,4.5,what are the steps for making a house I
292.199,4.321,don't know that is very interesting to
294.419,3.661,me so all of these random things that we
296.52,3.78,just all of a sudden need to research
298.08,3.899,and might become an expert on the next
300.3,3.899,one is sitting in your car for longer
301.979,4.201,than you intended to this again is kind
304.199,3.601,of related to Transitions transitions
306.18,3.239,can be difficult for us on the Spectrum
307.8,3.899,and a lot of us spend a lot of time in
309.419,4.981,our car trying to figure out how to get
311.699,4.801,to the next thing the next one is that
314.4,3.66,headphones make things better so if you
316.5,3.54,have a safe pair of headphones that you
318.06,2.94,like putting on when you put them on you
320.04,3.12,feel like you're in your own little
321.0,4.74,world in your own cocoon
323.16,5.7,X that one next row sensitive to
325.74,4.86,caffeine alcohol and or medication so
328.86,4.08,for me I have to drink decaf coffee
330.6,3.84,because if I have regular coffee I'm
332.94,3.3,going to be so wired that I'm
334.44,4.08,uncomfortable even if it's like half a
336.24,4.32,cup of caffeine alcohol I'm a
338.52,4.98,lightweight I can tolerate hardly
340.56,4.5,anything and then medication there are
343.5,3.36,more studies coming out that are showing
345.06,4.4,that autistic people can have
346.86,5.16,paradoxical reactions to medications
349.46,4.36,just food for thought next one is
352.02,4.2,feeling what others are feeling this is
353.82,4.439,related to the antenna thing that I was
356.22,3.6,talking about earlier this is like a
358.259,3.601,misconception about people in the
359.82,4.08,spectrum that were not empathetic many
361.86,5.1,people on the Spectrum are highly
363.9,5.04,empathetic even empathic and oftentimes
366.96,3.48,we take on the feelings of others this
368.94,3.06,happened to me I was leading a class on
370.44,4.38,dating and relationships the other day
372.0,5.1,and as soon as I started this session I
374.82,4.86,felt this overwhelming wave of grief
377.1,4.379,that was coming at me like collectively
379.68,3.42,from everyone I could feel everyone's
381.479,3.72,grief and it was so overwhelming that I
383.1,3.659,had tears in my eyes please tell me I'm
385.199,3.06,not alone in my ability to do this next
386.759,3.841,one is wanting to be alone but feeling
388.259,4.5,lonely no explanation necessary next one
390.6,4.5,is needing to know why for everything
392.759,4.081,very closely related to research mode
395.1,3.719,this is particularly important to
396.84,3.66,understand in kids and kids going
398.819,3.421,through the education system at a young
400.5,3.66,age tell them why help them understand
402.24,3.54,why it makes everything better next one
404.16,3.599,is wishing other people asked good
405.78,3.479,questions too you get what I'm saying
407.759,3.481,about this right as an autistic person
409.259,4.861,and maybe related to needing to know why
411.24,5.399,I ask a lot of questions and I feel like
414.12,4.019,I ask pretty darn good questions and I
416.639,4.261,don't feel like it's often reciprocated
418.139,4.981,back to me like I feel like non-autistic
420.9,4.019,holistic people do you know how to ask
423.12,4.76,questions sorry that's a bit judgy but
424.919,5.34,next comfy clothes always yes
427.88,4.24,sweatshirts sweatpants hair in a
430.259,4.021,ponytail preferred mode next one is
432.12,4.799,easily upset by Injustice this is like
434.28,4.44,so much more than just everyone being
436.919,3.72,upset by Injustice right nobody likes
438.72,3.66,Injustice but if there's any type of
440.639,4.381,Injustice happening in our current
442.38,4.74,situation we can't focus on anything
445.02,4.079,else until the Injustice is addressed
447.12,3.72,which obviously makes the world a very
449.099,3.901,difficult place to live in right now
450.84,4.38,next one on the bottom row why isn't
453.0,3.72,everyone as blunt as me wouldn't that be
455.22,3.06,so great if everybody would just say
456.72,2.94,exactly what they were thinking I think
458.28,3.72,that would be great I think that being
459.66,3.78,clear is being kind and I wish that
462.0,3.24,other people would just be freaking
463.44,4.44,blunt just tell me what you're thinking
465.24,4.799,I can handle it I promise next one not
467.88,3.78,wanting to appropriate the term autistic
470.039,3.421,what does that mean it means that a lot
471.66,3.659,of autistic people especially adults who
473.46,3.9,have not yet been diagnosed they feel
475.319,3.121,bad for using the term autistic because
477.36,3.239,they don't want to take it away from
478.44,3.96,other people who need it more let me
480.599,3.961,tell you you're not appropriating it by
482.4,3.9,using it if it helps you have more
484.56,3.359,self-compassion for your own Tendencies
486.3,3.839,and patterns you're not being selfish
487.919,4.56,you're not hurting other people but this
490.139,3.78,is a common concern that I hear a lot
492.479,2.701,from the autistic communities I don't
493.919,3.12,want to use the term and take it away
495.18,3.72,from somebody else you're not if there
497.039,3.181,are words you can use to better describe
498.9,3.299,your experiences and help you support
500.22,3.9,yourself nurture yourself give yourself
502.199,2.761,more compassion show up more fully in
504.12,3.24,the world
504.96,4.26,please do it and the last one planning
507.36,3.66,things perfectly and being unable to
509.22,3.9,execute so for people on the Spectrum
511.02,4.439,our executive functioning can often be
513.12,4.08,impacted and we might have the best
515.459,3.901,intentions we might be able to plan on
517.2,4.32,every nitty-gritty little detail and
519.36,3.84,focus in on all of the inner workings of
521.52,3.96,things that need to happen in order for
523.2,3.78,something to be executed flawlessly but
525.48,3.24,then when it actually comes time to
526.98,3.66,transition into doing that thing that
528.72,3.48,we've planned out perfectly a breakdown
530.64,3.84,can happen let me hear from you in the
532.2,4.079,comments how many of these did you check
534.48,3.419,off for me I'm pretty sure it was every
536.279,3.481,single one and I want to mention because
537.899,3.961,we talked about headphones here if you
539.76,4.74,haven't been able to find headphones or
541.86,4.38,earbuds that you like that make things
544.5,3.779,better and not worse you can try out
546.24,4.62,Flair this is my absolute favorite brand
548.279,4.261,they don't fully close off at the base
550.86,3.78,of it so that sound still gets through
552.54,4.08,it doesn't block out sounds it doesn't
554.64,3.84,make things muffled I've tried so many
556.62,3.779,earbuds where it just blocks stuff out
558.48,3.24,and it I can hear myself chewing I can
560.399,3.481,hear myself talking I don't like it
561.72,4.739,these earbuds by flare particularly
563.88,4.32,they're calmer ear buds I use them all
566.459,4.44,the time and what they do is it just
568.2,4.259,reduces the high and low frequencies so
570.899,4.981,that you're getting more of an evenly
572.459,5.341,based sound input that's my
575.88,3.12,non-scientific way of saying it but if
577.8,2.64,you've been looking for earbuds that
579.0,3.42,will help you and actually make things
580.44,3.54,better I'll put the link to these in the
582.42,3.24,description I love them they have some
583.98,3.359,without this lanyard too but they're
585.66,3.239,very tiny so I actually kind of like the
587.339,2.761,lanyard on the back so that I can keep
588.899,3.901,track of them and there's different
590.1,4.5,colors clear purple blue thanks so much
592.8,4.62,for watching as a gentle reminder again
594.6,4.62,this bingo card is not a diagnostic tool

Start,Duration,Text
0.06,5.48,let's talk about that post-socializing
2.76,2.78,processing
7.74,3.96,so I'm sure a lot of you guys can
9.54,4.979,resonate with this but this was one of
11.7,5.46,the most prominent autistic experiences
14.519,4.441,in my own Journey when you're diagnosed
17.16,4.8,later in life there is this whole
18.96,5.76,process of trying to bring awareness to
21.96,3.92,what your masks are things that you just
24.72,3.18,kind of
25.88,4.78,unconsciously but at the same time
27.9,4.56,consciously did but for your whole life
30.66,4.919,you just thought that those were aspects
32.46,5.759,of yourself while you seemingly kind of
35.579,7.441,learn to unconsciously suppress your
38.219,7.801,autistic self and learn how to try to
43.02,4.68,live life in a neurotypical way for a
46.02,4.08,lot of other people out there who are
47.7,4.8,late diagnosed like me are usually
50.1,4.08,people who are high masking so there's
52.5,3.719,this particular thing that I've noticed
54.18,3.84,about myself and I feel like a lot of
56.219,3.781,other high masking autistics out there
58.02,4.62,can also resonate with this and it's
60.0,5.28,this whole experience of analyzing
62.64,4.56,yourself the social situations that you
65.28,4.08,are just in the conversations you had
67.2,4.56,the scripts that you were following in
69.36,5.7,those interactions and just kind of
71.76,6.06,analytically studying the way that you
75.06,5.04,performed in those interactions and
77.82,4.74,trying to point out the things that went
80.1,4.559,over smoothly and correctly and the
82.56,3.9,things that didn't really go over as
84.659,4.32,well I want to talk about this
86.46,5.82,experience because I feel like if we
88.979,6.841,don't bring awareness to this thing that
92.28,6.12,we do we can tend to go through life
95.82,4.86,putting ourselves down again and again
98.4,4.92,without really knowing that we are doing
100.68,4.56,that I think a part of this video is not
103.32,3.659,only to talk about this right I just
105.24,4.44,want to have like a casual conversation
106.979,4.92,about what it's like to go through this
109.68,3.36,but I also want to talk about ways that
111.899,3.781,we can
113.04,5.579,do this in a more healthy way perhaps
115.68,6.18,where we don't have to put ourselves
118.619,5.161,down as much or in certain moments when
121.86,4.259,do you have to draw that line with over
123.78,3.54,analyzing what you could have done what
126.119,3.12,you should have done a little bit too
127.32,4.2,much and when to kind of lay that to
129.239,4.441,rest and just give yourself some
131.52,4.02,reprieve so this is something that I've
133.68,5.52,always done throughout my whole life to
135.54,5.76,a very intense extent because I was such
139.2,3.78,a high masking person throughout my
141.3,4.2,whole life I think that's part of the
142.98,5.04,reason why I wasn't diagnosed until
145.5,5.12,later and I think a big contributor to
148.02,5.4,that is that process of
150.62,5.32,analyzing and studying yourself in these
153.42,4.2,social situations after the fact when I
155.94,3.72,work with my one-on-one clients I notice
157.62,4.199,that this is something that other people
159.66,5.04,experience pretty heavily as well not
161.819,4.681,just me it makes sense there's objective
164.7,4.5,things to it there's subjective things
166.5,4.14,and I always like to kind of analyze all
169.2,4.259,the different ways that we are affected
170.64,5.04,by a certain type of behavior so
173.459,5.041,objectively I think this makes a lot of
175.68,5.1,sense right in the context of autism and
178.5,6.18,socialization I feel like a lot of
180.78,8.4,high-masking people we tend to come up
184.68,6.779,with a huge book full of social norms
189.18,3.54,different types of tonalities what they
191.459,3.121,mean different types of facial
192.72,3.54,expressions what they mean how to
194.58,3.6,interpret different types of people in
196.26,3.96,different contexts what are the
198.18,4.08,appropriate ways you should respond and
200.22,3.96,how you should interpret what are the
202.26,3.54,appropriate ways to communicate what you
204.18,4.08,need to communicate in order to be
205.8,7.14,interpreted correctly with this specific
208.26,7.86,person and in in social situations a lot
212.94,5.34,of the times we have that Rolodex at the
216.12,4.92,ready in order to flip through and
218.28,4.5,interact in real time right and I feel
221.04,3.839,like a lot of us can get really smooth
222.78,4.319,at this to a certain extent I'm not
224.879,4.681,saying it's easy right it always comes
227.099,4.2,out a detriment to yourself after the
229.56,4.02,fact you may feel completely burnt out
231.299,5.401,you may be non-verbal I feel like what
233.58,6.48,we don't talk enough about is what is
236.7,6.0,the effects to those of us who can
240.06,5.16,actually appropriately interact in
242.7,5.58,social situations let's say probably
245.22,4.739,eight out of ten times because we put
248.28,4.26,ourselves in these high stress
249.959,5.541,situations in our own head to make every
252.54,5.879,interaction go over smoothly I feel like
255.5,5.019,socializing has always been such a
258.419,4.741,polarizing experience for me because of
260.519,5.221,this very thing that I do in my head
263.16,4.319,every single time on one hand there's a
265.74,4.14,big part of me that craves connecting
267.479,5.041,with other people that craves talking to
269.88,5.28,other people there's also that side of
272.52,4.38,me that gets genuinely objectively
275.16,5.16,exhausted interacting with people
276.9,7.44,because I have to be so on top of it in
280.32,6.42,order to go through that interaction and
284.34,4.32,then there's that after part right that
286.74,4.739,after part is what I really wanted to
288.66,6.36,talk about today so usually after
291.479,6.241,interacting with people I noticed that I
295.02,5.88,tend to go into my head during that
297.72,6.0,burnout phase of post interaction and
300.9,5.46,burnout phase usually for me nowadays
303.72,4.8,lasts for about a few hours
306.36,4.5,so for the rest of the day I may not be
308.52,4.2,able to really interact much or put
310.86,4.14,thoughts together as smoothly I just
312.72,5.039,need to mentally take a break from
315.0,5.34,everything back then for much of my life
317.759,5.461,usually following interactions I would
320.34,4.68,be burnt out for weeks on end so I
323.22,4.14,wouldn't be able to socially interact
325.02,4.38,with anyone for weeks I wouldn't be able
327.36,4.8,to do anything I would have really bad
329.4,6.299,executive dysfunction and I would just
332.16,6.42,kind of only be able to lay around and
335.699,4.56,turn to Mush until I could charge my
338.58,3.899,batteries back up and go back out into
340.259,5.821,the world of course since bringing
342.479,6.481,awareness to me doing this Behavior I've
346.08,6.42,made a conscious effort to not analyze
348.96,6.36,myself as much but it is a part of being
352.5,5.22,autistic because you have this need to
355.32,4.379,understand whether or not you have to
357.72,4.62,make those social adjustments in the
359.699,4.921,future that is just an objective part of
362.34,4.02,life that I think you know even
364.62,2.46,non-autistic people have to go through
366.36,2.82,so
367.08,3.899,I think it's just like a humanistic
369.18,4.14,trait to want to empathize for other
370.979,4.741,people and want to make sure that you're
373.32,4.62,doing your best to make every
375.72,4.86,interaction something that you could
377.94,4.68,feel proud of I've come to notice that
380.58,4.679,there's many times where I'm running
382.62,6.299,errands by myself or I'm just doing some
385.259,7.101,sort of task by myself at home and my
388.919,6.72,mind will naturally wander into past
392.36,5.86,interactions that I've had and analyzing
395.639,4.921,how that interaction went how I
398.22,4.68,responded trying to figure out whether
400.56,4.079,or not my response is appropriate
402.9,3.9,whether or not my response is something
404.639,3.84,I'm happy with so for example if I'm
406.8,4.56,going through a past interaction in my
408.479,5.461,head and I actually responded in a way
411.36,4.679,that was appropriate and in a way that I
413.94,4.02,could feel good about I'm like okay that
416.039,3.961,was really good I'm proud of myself for
417.96,4.019,that I'm proud of what I did I'm proud
420.0,4.08,of how I feel I'm proud of how I made
421.979,4.141,this other person feel but there's also
424.08,5.04,many times where I beat myself up over
426.12,6.54,my responses and that part is really
429.12,5.4,hard there's so many times where I think
432.66,4.56,about the ways that I should have
434.52,4.38,responded and I think about how I didn't
437.22,4.919,respond that way because it doesn't come
438.9,5.28,naturally to me or I just don't think I
442.139,4.56,could pull it off in the way that I want
444.18,4.919,I would want it to come off in scenarios
446.699,4.741,where I didn't respond appropriately
449.099,4.981,because I genuinely didn't know those
451.44,5.099,scenarios I I kind of cringe at because
454.08,4.619,I could get into that mindset of like oh
456.539,4.081,I should have known but usually I could
458.699,3.961,kind of stop myself there and be like
460.62,4.38,Irene you just didn't know it's that
462.66,4.74,simple you know now move on with your
465.0,4.199,life it's like that initial cringe I
467.4,3.78,feel like when you're just like oh my
469.199,4.62,God how did I not see that in the moment
471.18,6.12,I'm cringing because if I put myself in
473.819,6.481,that person's shoes and I witnessed my
477.3,5.339,response I would have felt bad or like
480.3,3.36,you know you start to go over that whole
482.639,3.361,process
483.66,6.479,but one thing that I struggle the most
486.0,6.78,with is more so when I'm analyzing the
490.139,5.641,ways I should have responded and how I
492.78,6.8,want to respond but realizing that I am
495.78,7.08,just not capable of responding that way
499.58,5.2,that is the part that I really have a
502.86,3.779,hard time with and this isn't for every
504.78,3.24,autistic person right but for me
506.639,4.021,personally
508.02,3.439,a part of my autism is just having a
510.66,4.559,general
511.459,5.5,monotone flat affect right
515.219,4.021,my tone of voice doesn't really change
516.959,5.041,from this no matter what mood I'm
519.24,5.219,experiencing my facial expressions don't
522.0,3.6,really change much outside of this and
524.459,4.141,smiling
525.6,6.48,and there's many times during social
528.6,6.6,interactions where I find myself wishing
532.08,5.52,that I was just more expressive if I'm
535.2,5.759,not careful and I'm in that analyzing
537.6,6.08,phase of post-socialization I could
540.959,6.681,start to genuinely beat myself up over
543.68,7.18,just not being able to be the person
547.64,5.56,that is I guess more socially acceptable
550.86,5.52,throughout my life and even to this day
553.2,6.42,I struggle with watching other people be
556.38,5.7,super expressive and bubbly and
559.62,5.88,getting into so much detail about it too
562.08,6.48,oftentimes I watch people interacting
565.5,5.399,and I get so lost in almost the
568.56,4.8,technicalities of how they're
570.899,4.261,interacting I analyze their facial
573.36,4.2,expressions I analyze their body
575.16,5.52,gestures I analyze the tonality of their
577.56,4.98,voice I even analyze the way they put
580.68,4.8,their sentences together and their
582.54,5.34,responses together and of course this is
585.48,5.1,such an autistic way of viewing
587.88,5.1,and analyzing another person right and
590.58,5.58,how they just naturally interact because
592.98,5.7,to that person it's just them responding
596.16,3.42,to the world around them but for me it's
598.68,3.96,like
599.58,5.759,almost a science or a math and I'm just
602.64,5.58,like how do they do that and how do I
605.339,5.0,emulate that can I even emulate it I
608.22,6.6,think because Society
610.339,6.94,oftentimes idealizes and worships uh
614.82,3.8,more charismatic type of Personality a
617.279,4.321,more bubbly
618.62,5.32,extroverted type of personality I can
621.6,4.56,start to really feel low about myself
623.94,4.32,because I feel like I'm just the
626.16,4.08,complete opposite of that right I often
628.26,3.78,find myself when I'm in spaces with
630.24,4.4,other people or even within my
632.04,6.72,interpersonal relationships feeling like
634.64,6.1,I am a Debbie Downer and not for any
638.76,4.259,other reason than just who I am
640.74,3.96,naturally and how I
643.019,6.121,carry myself
644.7,8.16,but I feel this deep sense of ineptness
649.14,6.0,to be someone that other people want to
652.86,4.5,be around and there's been many moments
655.14,5.04,in my life where I've tried to emulate
657.36,4.62,that type of personality type I've tried
660.18,5.04,to make my voice be a little bit more
661.98,5.099,bubbly and I've tried to make my facial
665.22,5.46,expressions be a little bit more
667.079,5.7,expressive and if I were to think back
670.68,5.399,to those moments I feel like it just
672.779,5.221,never came across right I feel like in
676.079,4.801,high school it kind of just came across
678.0,5.1,as being ditzy for example I was always
680.88,4.74,just that light-hearted person that
683.1,5.28,wouldn't be the butt of the joke that
685.62,5.459,was my way of lightening up my portion
688.38,5.699,of an interaction but I feel like a lot
691.079,5.461,of people ended up perceiving me as this
694.079,4.801,ditzy person when in reality I was
696.54,4.2,almost probably more hyper aware of
698.88,4.5,everything going on underneath the
700.74,5.7,surface than everyone else As I Grew
703.38,7.019,into my early early 20s in college I
706.44,6.12,feel like my new mask was just trying to
710.399,4.5,be more authentic to myself and not be
712.56,5.399,the butt of the joke so I wanted to be
714.899,4.56,more respected but I didn't know how to
717.959,4.261,be more light-hearted or more
719.459,5.82,charismatic without that ditziness and
722.22,5.64,so I would end up trying to attempt to
725.279,5.221,be a lot more energetic but then it
727.86,5.7,wouldn't come across right because my
730.5,4.92,voice is just like down here and then I
733.56,3.959,would try to add inflections to it but
735.42,4.14,it would still be down here with the
737.519,4.201,inflections and it just was not natural
739.56,4.32,and I would notice it in the moment
741.72,4.38,because when I heard myself talking I
743.88,4.62,would be like oh that did not sound how
746.1,3.72,I wanted to sound like you know things
748.5,4.5,like that
749.82,5.4,and I feel like that's always been such
753.0,5.579,a struggle for me as an autistic woman
755.22,5.82,is feeling a disconnect between what I'm
758.579,5.341,feeling inside and what ends up coming
761.04,4.62,out and being perceived by others and
763.92,3.9,that could feel very helpless a lot of
765.66,4.26,the times if I could come up with a
767.82,4.86,metaphor for this it's like what's
769.92,6.359,inside maybe green and what comes out
772.68,6.12,maybe orange and so everyone perceives
776.279,5.101,that orange color in reality you are
778.8,4.5,feeling green you think to yourself what
781.38,5.639,do I have to do in order to get other
783.3,7.26,people to see this green and oftentimes
787.019,6.44,the perfect combination to get that
790.56,5.579,green across is probably five different
793.459,4.841,connectors and colors to get that green
796.139,4.021,across let's say for a neurotypical
798.3,3.599,person when they feel green green comes
800.16,4.56,out right it's that easy it's just this
801.899,4.861,one streamlined connector from inside to
804.72,4.14,outside I feel like a lot of the times
806.76,5.22,for autistic people if we're feeling
808.86,5.039,green inside it's never a straight shot
811.98,4.62,it's always like multiple different
813.899,5.641,connectors so I would have to use blue
816.6,4.739,and yellow in order to get green out and
819.54,3.539,that whole thing is so confusing
821.339,4.081,especially when you start to get into
823.079,4.32,all these more complex type of
825.42,4.2,interactions let's say you have five
827.399,4.981,different colors going on inside imagine
829.62,4.62,each color has two to five different
832.38,4.38,lines and so all of a sudden you're
834.24,4.2,balancing all of these different lines
836.76,4.259,in order to convey what you need inside
838.44,4.38,out it just feels so impossible and all
841.019,4.62,of these things get mixed up in the
842.82,6.9,process and that part could feel so
845.639,6.721,frustrating after the fact and analyzing
849.72,5.34,how you should socially interact and how
852.36,5.34,you did socially interact is just such a
855.06,5.76,tiring experience altogether the whole
857.7,6.66,topic of camouflaging is such a Charged
860.82,7.079,topic because on one hand a lot of
864.36,5.52,people say that it's almost a luxury to
867.899,3.24,be able to camouflage because a lot of
869.88,4.019,if
871.139,4.801,other autistic people who aren't able to
873.899,4.56,camouflage have to suffer the
875.94,4.74,consequences of that right whereas those
878.459,4.74,who are more High masking and more
880.68,4.5,capable of camouflaging can have the
883.199,4.681,luxury of blending in and out of society
885.18,5.76,how they want to it's almost like that's
887.88,6.3,a tool accessible to that person into
890.94,5.639,that population versus inaccessible to
894.18,4.62,another population it's interesting
896.579,4.5,because I feel like within that topic
898.8,5.46,the only people who get frustrated about
901.079,5.401,it is neurotypical loved ones of the
904.26,4.139,autistic person I feel like I don't
906.48,4.02,really see other autistic people feeling
908.399,4.641,bitterness or resentment towards other
910.5,5.16,autistics who can mask in camouflage
913.04,5.56,it's usually like a loved one who's
915.66,5.1,neurotypical and they feel resentment
918.6,3.96,that their autistic loved one can't do
920.76,4.439,something whereas another autistic
922.56,5.1,person can and then they want to go in
925.199,5.461,and express their bitterness through
927.66,5.1,invalidating the high masking autistic
930.66,3.9,population and that is always going to
932.76,5.42,be a conversation right
934.56,7.079,because there is a lot of unspoken
938.18,6.04,experiences of high masking autistic
941.639,3.961,people that have yet to be talked about
944.22,4.14,and I feel like we're only on the
945.6,5.76,precipice of bringing up that type of
948.36,5.159,conversation because I feel like now
951.36,4.14,we're in a day and age where a lot of
953.519,4.44,high-masking autistics are finally
955.5,5.339,getting diagnosed and we're starting to
957.959,4.981,see oh my God there's almost a lost
960.839,5.521,population of autistics that are now
962.94,6.48,being discovered I feel a deep need to
966.36,5.94,speak on that experience the struggles
969.42,4.8,of being a high masking autistic and
972.3,4.56,when I speak on it I'm not trying to
974.22,5.28,invalidate anyone I'm trying to say hey
976.86,5.64,all of our experiences are valid there
979.5,6.54,is so much pressure when you are high
982.5,6.06,masking in order to fit in there is so
986.04,6.0,much self-loathing that comes with it
988.56,5.7,and self-criticizing oh I got emotional
992.04,4.68,just talking about that now
994.26,4.98,when you feel like you have
996.72,4.94,what you need in order to analyze
999.24,5.88,yourself critique yourself fix yourself
1001.66,6.28,you never get a break in your own mind
1005.12,5.519,you really never get a break you kind of
1007.94,5.639,learn to live life knowing that you
1010.639,6.181,cannot show up as you are and as you
1013.579,7.38,want to you will always need to go into
1016.82,7.32,your head go into the webs of trying to
1020.959,6.181,convey what is inside outwardly the best
1024.14,5.4,that you can and that is if you are
1027.14,4.919,trying to honor yourself in your
1029.54,4.08,authenticity there's also a lot of
1032.059,3.481,people out there who suppresses
1033.62,4.98,themselves and their authenticity so
1035.54,5.82,much so that that part of themselves is
1038.6,6.18,not even there anymore it is fossilized
1041.36,5.699,underground never to be found or
1044.78,5.04,accessed in that moment a lot of the
1047.059,5.461,times because you analyze yourself so
1049.82,4.739,much you end up holding yourself back
1052.52,5.279,from connecting with others too because
1054.559,5.881,it's almost like you can never win or
1057.799,5.281,you just don't have it in you anymore to
1060.44,4.44,put that much brain work into simply
1063.08,4.5,having a conversation with the person
1064.88,5.58,there's been so many times where I play
1067.58,5.339,out a conversation or a scenario in my
1070.46,4.14,head before it even happens and this is
1072.919,3.601,part of the scripting process right
1074.6,4.579,where I just play out the interaction
1076.52,6.6,over and over again in different
1079.179,5.86,varieties of responses and I almost try
1083.12,3.9,to play out the consequences of certain
1085.039,3.601,responses in my head as well trying to
1087.02,3.539,predict how the person's going to
1088.64,4.32,respond we're trying to predict how
1090.559,4.5,someone's going to interpret me based
1092.96,4.02,off of my previous experiences with them
1095.059,4.441,or my knowledge and interpretation of
1096.98,4.439,them only to get to a point where I get
1099.5,4.14,completely brain fried because there's
1101.419,3.901,some spots in the script where I can't
1103.64,3.419,fill in the blank because I don't know
1105.32,4.44,if I'm interpreting things correctly or
1107.059,5.101,I don't know if my responses are going
1109.76,4.68,to be appropriate and then I ultimately
1112.16,4.5,think to myself I just need to avoid
1114.44,3.479,this interaction altogether because I
1116.66,4.379,don't know know if it's going to play
1117.919,5.581,out correctly or be something I could be
1121.039,5.221,proud of it's exhausting to have to go
1123.5,5.16,through that process it's very lonely
1126.26,5.88,too because you end up alienating
1128.66,5.7,yourself from the world because you feel
1132.14,4.68,incapable of being perceived by the
1134.36,5.52,world the other day I was driving to the
1136.82,6.3,grocery store and I randomly played back
1139.88,6.36,a scenario in my head of an interaction
1143.12,4.919,I had with someone a long time ago and I
1146.24,5.4,don't even consciously do this it just
1148.039,7.26,happens right and I played it back in my
1151.64,5.34,head and I had this realization that my
1155.299,4.861,response could have been interpreted
1156.98,5.22,another way I had this sinking feeling
1160.16,4.379,in my stomach where I was like oh my God
1162.2,4.08,this whole time I thought that that
1164.539,4.081,interaction was pretty good and smooth
1166.28,4.92,and I moved on from it but now that I
1168.62,5.34,look back on it and I put myself in
1171.2,4.92,their shoes and I interpret my responses
1173.96,4.14,in all these different other ways they
1176.12,5.1,could have interpreted my responses to
1178.1,5.28,be negative and what if they did is that
1181.22,3.959,why we're not talking right now and if
1183.38,4.26,they did interpret it incorrectly how
1185.179,4.021,can I make up for it the next time I see
1187.64,3.12,them but I don't even know if that's
1189.2,4.32,necessary because I don't know if they
1190.76,4.38,interpret it poorly but I guess that's a
1193.52,3.12,possibility and I start to cringe and I
1195.14,4.14,start to panic and I start to feel bad
1196.64,6.18,about myself this is just one of the
1199.28,4.56,many scenarios in which I post analyze
1202.82,3.0,myself
1203.84,4.079,and it doesn't even have to happen right
1205.82,4.56,after the interaction it could happen
1207.919,6.0,after the interaction but it also kind
1210.38,5.76,of haunts me unconsciously even months
1213.919,4.14,later or years later I'll like think
1216.14,4.56,back to these random moments where I'm
1218.059,4.681,like wait I didn't do that correctly I
1220.7,5.7,don't think I did that correctly and my
1222.74,5.76,heart truly feels for myself and my
1226.4,4.399,clients when I see that we're all doing
1228.5,5.299,this you know post
1230.799,6.401,socialization analyzing of ourselves
1233.799,5.74,because I feel like that's our attempt
1237.2,4.8,at trying to be as self-aware as
1239.539,5.161,possible because there's the other
1242.0,4.919,aspect of autism that is more commonly
1244.7,4.68,talked about which is autistic people
1246.919,5.221,are oblivious to social cues autistic
1249.38,5.039,people can come across as selfish or
1252.14,4.62,narcissistic because we only view things
1254.419,4.441,from our perspective and we don't take
1256.76,3.539,other people into account autistic
1258.86,3.24,people don't know how to empathize
1260.299,5.701,autistic people don't know how to
1262.1,6.54,consider other people and that is a real
1266.0,4.679,part of autism I feel like I struggled a
1268.64,4.5,lot with that as a child being perceived
1270.679,4.38,in that sort of selfish way and I kind
1273.14,4.5,of go over that in my video where I go
1275.059,5.401,over my Elementary School report cards
1277.64,5.039,in the second trimester he wrote Irene I
1280.46,4.62,am worried about your behavior and how
1282.679,5.101,you treat others I am worried about your
1285.08,4.44,attitude towards school and learning I
1287.78,4.019,can only help you if you are willing
1289.52,3.779,Irene you need to control your talking
1291.799,4.021,and be aware of other children's
1293.299,4.201,feelings I am worried about how you
1295.82,3.9,treat others you need to treat people
1297.5,4.74,nicely if you are going to have friends
1299.72,4.68,though Irene was cooperative in class
1302.24,4.74,she had a tendency to speak her mind
1304.4,4.92,which bothered some teachers she
1306.98,4.62,encountered and alienated some
1309.32,4.26,classmates a lot of the feedback that my
1311.6,4.26,teachers gave me was basically how
1313.58,4.86,selfish I was and how I didn't consider
1315.86,4.5,other kids and I feel like for a lot of
1318.44,3.719,high-masking autistic people we become
1320.36,4.199,over accommodating I feel like we even
1322.159,4.14,take ourselves out of the equation we
1324.559,3.421,only bring ourselves back in when we
1326.299,3.901,have to scrutinize ourselves and fix
1327.98,3.84,ourselves it's really sad if you think
1330.2,3.839,about it you have to think to yourself
1331.82,4.14,is there a way to be self-aware is there
1334.039,4.52,a way to consider other people without
1335.96,5.699,completely putting yourself down and
1338.559,5.321,de-centering yourself from your own life
1341.659,4.081,I think a great way to try to approach
1343.88,5.7,this is to always check in with yourself
1345.74,6.72,and see how you feel about things and do
1349.58,5.76,what feels right to you as long as you
1352.46,5.4,feel right with your intentions as long
1355.34,5.28,as you feel good about how you want to
1357.86,4.799,translate that to another person there
1360.62,4.559,comes a time where you just have to lay
1362.659,4.38,that to rest yes if there's something
1365.179,4.38,you said or did that doesn't sit right
1367.039,5.221,with you and upon analyzing it you're
1369.559,4.98,like oh next time I want to change it
1372.26,6.6,by all means go through that processing
1374.539,6.541,and apply it but if you start to go into
1378.86,4.98,all these scenarios of trying to
1381.08,5.459,interpret how others are perceiving you
1383.84,4.02,in all of these different unspoken
1386.539,2.941,scenarios
1387.86,3.54,that is when things start to get
1389.48,3.78,unhealthy because you're no longer
1391.4,3.72,thinking about things from your own mind
1393.26,4.5,you're trying to almost put your mind
1395.12,6.179,into their body which is just impossible
1397.76,6.0,right and perceive you from all these
1401.299,4.921,different scenarios that all may not be
1403.76,4.62,true right it's just all of these
1406.22,4.319,negative perceptions of yourself being
1408.38,4.94,played out and projected onto this other
1410.539,4.861,person I want you guys to get used to
1413.32,5.02,understanding that all you have control
1415.4,5.94,over is yourself what you do with your
1418.34,5.04,life and your actions if you could feel
1421.34,5.1,good about what you did and what you
1423.38,6.24,said and how you carry yourself then
1426.44,4.68,that is all you can really do if someone
1429.62,4.02,has an issue with you if someone
1431.12,4.98,misinterpreted you it is their job to
1433.64,5.58,come to you and talk about it with you
1436.1,5.459,sort it out with you and for you to then
1439.22,5.4,clarify to them that wasn't my intention
1441.559,5.341,I'm sorry I made you feel that way this
1444.62,4.2,is what my actual intention was of
1446.9,4.38,course there's ways that you can open
1448.82,4.32,things up and open up that conversation
1451.28,4.92,to allow that person to feel more
1453.14,4.98,comfortable to come to you you know if
1456.2,3.9,you feel like maybe there is some sort
1458.12,4.559,of tension there you could say hey are
1460.1,4.38,we okay I know sometimes I could come
1462.679,4.321,across a certain way just wanted to
1464.48,4.5,check in and see if there's any sort of
1467.0,4.98,thing that bothered you and we could
1468.98,4.5,clear the air in that sense there are
1471.98,3.54,totally ways where you can open up that
1473.48,5.22,door for them right if they aren't
1475.52,5.7,comfortable confronting you directly
1478.7,4.62,but if they continually say there's
1481.22,4.14,nothing wrong if they continually don't
1483.32,4.92,bring anything up to you
1485.36,4.92,it's not your job to try to figure out
1488.24,3.84,what is wrong it is not your
1490.28,3.96,responsibility to take care of their
1492.08,4.44,perception of you their interpretation
1494.24,4.62,of you it is not your job to carry the
1496.52,4.92,weight of their emotion right it only
1498.86,4.439,becomes part of your job when they bring
1501.44,4.44,it to you and as someone who loves them
1503.299,5.341,and cares about them you are in there
1505.88,4.62,holding that emotion with them and
1508.64,4.14,figuring it out together and navigating
1510.5,5.22,those emotions together but it should
1512.78,5.519,never be something that solely lands in
1515.72,5.52,your lap and is your job so let me ask
1518.299,5.821,you guys do you guys analyze your social
1521.24,5.58,interactions after the fact and how is
1524.12,5.34,that process for you is it just a very
1526.82,4.5,objective experience or do you guys find
1529.46,4.38,yourself beating yourselves up during
1531.32,5.16,that processing and also does it feel
1533.84,5.88,like physically exhausting to you when
1536.48,5.16,you do analyze your interactions after
1539.72,4.439,the fact because I know for myself I
1541.64,4.56,used to get physically exhausted when I
1544.159,4.62,would just lay there and think about all
1546.2,5.28,of the social cues I missed or all of
1548.779,5.101,the ways that I responded poorly because
1551.48,3.66,it could have been misinterpreted in a
1553.88,3.659,certain way
1555.14,4.139,I used to just sit there and literally
1557.539,4.26,beat myself up and get physically
1559.279,5.041,drained from that whole process and I
1561.799,5.221,want you guys to also write how can you
1564.32,4.859,start to be easier on yourselves in this
1567.02,4.32,processing from here on out what are
1569.179,5.521,ways you can start to integrate empathy
1571.34,4.98,and re-center yourself in that process
1574.7,3.66,other than that thank you guys for
1576.32,4.02,tuning in with me this week I will see
1578.36,5.84,you on next week's video don't forget to
1580.34,3.86,take care of yourselves bye guys
1596.559,3.061,thank you
Start,Duration,Text
0.04,3.399,so there's sometimes this idea that
1.52,3.56,people who don't look autistic people
3.439,3.721,who don't like outwardly appear to be
5.08,4.32,struggling to every single person they
7.16,4.519,meet all of the time those people
9.4,3.92,shouldn't use the label autistic that
11.679,4.12,they're taking something away from
13.32,4.92,people who are really autistic but we
15.799,4.681,know that masking exists masking or
18.24,4.56,camouflaging being hiding autistic
20.48,4.28,traits to avoid the stigmatization and
22.8,4.28,discrimination you might face if you
24.76,4.4,speak or act differently to societal
27.08,3.599,expectations I have a video about four
29.16,3.279,different types of atis masking that I
30.679,4.321,posted recently I'll leave linked here
32.439,4.761,the dsm5 diagnostic criteria for autism
35.0,4.36,acknowledges that autistic traits might
37.2,4.28,be masked by learn strategies in later
39.36,5.44,life and masking has been spoken about
41.48,5.04,since at least the 1990s in 1999 the
44.8,3.72,book pretending to be normal was
46.52,4.24,published but people will often try and
48.52,4.559,judge how autistic someone is based on
50.76,4.2,what they externalize and some autistic
53.079,3.681,people who are diagnosed as children are
54.96,3.68,actually told they've outgrown the
56.76,3.2,diagnosis that they've recovered because
58.64,2.8,their autistic traits are no longer
59.96,3.16,longer as obvious as they were when they
61.44,3.64,were a child we can't tell that you're
63.12,3.48,different anymore you must be fine so
65.08,3.76,today I'm going to go through four
66.6,4.76,reasons why autistic masking is a big
68.84,4.16,deal actually why not externalizing your
71.36,3.72,autistic traits doesn't just mean you're
73.0,4.28,fine now and how it can actually be
75.08,4.28,dangerous for artistic people to mask a
77.28,4.08,lot number one it's well documented that
79.36,3.68,masking can be pretty DN terrible for
81.36,3.52,autistic people's mental health in a
83.04,3.8,number of ways let's talk about a few of
84.88,3.879,them first of all anxiety is a big one
86.84,3.76,and in my video not stemming is more
88.759,3.521,dangerous than you think I focused on a
90.6,3.44,study that found that autistic children
92.28,3.56,who stim less so stemming being
94.04,3.68,self-stimulatory behaviors some of the
95.84,4.0,more stereotypical ones associated with
97.72,3.84,autism are hand flapping and rocking
99.84,3.48,children who did less of that as they
101.56,3.919,got older the study followed them as
103.32,4.159,they grew up they were more anxious than
105.479,4.521,the children who did the same amount of
107.479,4.68,rocking and flapping or the children who
110.0,3.96,increased the researchers didn't expect
112.159,3.88,that result they kind of thought well
113.96,4.04,the less autistic symptoms somebody has
116.039,4.241,the less obviously autistic a person
118.0,4.079,seems the happier they'll be that wasn't
120.28,3.36,how it worked out if you're autistic you
122.079,3.161,probably agree that stemming can be
123.64,3.68,super relaxing it can help you to
125.24,4.079,process your sensory environment it can
127.32,4.84,even bring you like pure joy and
129.319,4.56,Euphoria I don't personally suppress
132.16,3.56,stemming because there's anything wrong
133.879,3.08,with the act of stemming I suppress
135.72,2.879,stimming because I don't want other
136.959,3.241,people to think I'm weird and I don't
138.599,3.92,want other people to comment on what I'm
140.2,4.039,doing who knows how I'd move my body in
142.519,3.36,a completely accepting world I was
144.239,3.321,thinking about that the other day what
145.879,3.481,would I be doing with myself I don't
147.56,4.319,know about you but it makes sense to me
149.36,5.239,that asking would be kind of anxiety
151.879,6.36,inducing social situations to me feel
154.599,5.481,kind of fragmented scrambled chaotic the
158.239,4.161,kind of words I'd probably use to
160.08,4.64,describe it there's so much to kind of
162.4,4.839,Monitor and overthink and there's an
164.72,4.439,onslaught of information coming at you
167.239,3.841,one theme that came up in this 2019
169.159,3.881,study in which autistic people spoke
171.08,3.879,about their experiences with masking was
173.04,3.279,that it's cognitively taxing and yeah
174.959,2.801,when you're interacting with somebody if
176.319,2.721,they're talking to you you're thinking
177.76,2.68,about what they're saying but you're
179.04,2.88,also kind of thinking about what you're
180.44,3.4,going to say next and then you're also
181.92,3.319,thinking about when to speak when to
183.84,2.84,interject you don't want an awkward
185.239,3.041,silence but you also don't want to talk
186.68,4.08,over them because that's rude you're
188.28,4.64,thinking about your body language facial
190.76,4.16,expression eye contact you're thinking
192.92,3.959,about their body language their facial
194.92,3.84,expression their eye contact and then
196.879,3.801,you've got the whole sensory World
198.76,3.72,churning around you you know which might
200.68,3.32,be distracting and tone as well you got
202.48,3.56,to think about your tone their tone
204.0,4.48,everybody's tone one man described
206.04,3.919,masking as like a foreign language even
208.48,3.8,though one might have adopted it to a
209.959,3.441,good extent it is never native he said
212.28,3.0,and I think that's such a good
213.4,3.6,description because yeah while you can
215.28,4.039,get better at masking over time I
217.0,5.879,definitely improved my masking skills as
219.319,5.0,I've got older it still doesn't flow and
222.879,3.881,there are times that are better than
224.319,4.64,others but it's not easy and it doesn't
226.76,4.839,always stop when you go home after a
228.959,5.401,period of socializing I tend to just go
231.599,5.321,over it again and again I replay moments
234.36,5.159,from it I cringe and I make like audible
236.92,4.48,noises like I think about how I could
239.519,3.64,have done things better sometimes I even
241.4,4.08,write down notes for improvement it
243.159,3.961,doesn't go out of my head and it often
245.48,4.16,when I'm weighing up whether to go out
247.12,5.199,and do a social thing I have to think do
249.64,4.599,I have the energy to do the actual thing
252.319,3.12,and then also kind of deal with with the
254.239,2.921,aftermath this is a thing that
255.439,3.721,nonautistic people can do as well I
257.16,4.16,think it's a social anxiety thing but
259.16,4.24,yeah masking can increase social anxiety
261.32,3.72,for autistic people for sure masking the
263.4,4.48,fact that you're autistic can lead to
265.04,5.92,depression too unfortunately a 2021
267.88,5.159,study found that people scoring 125 and
270.96,3.92,above on the cat Q which is like a
273.039,2.921,little masking test that you can do I've
274.88,2.4,done it before in a video I'll leave
275.96,3.04,that link if you want to do it along
277.28,4.04,with me it's a questionnaire developed
279.0,4.84,to measure autistic masking basically
281.32,4.76,and yeah individuals scoring 125 and
283.84,4.16,above showed the greatest increase in
286.08,3.399,relative risk for generalized anxiety
288.0,3.0,and depression as well and I'll leave a
289.479,3.681,trigger warning here in case you want to
291.0,4.12,skip to the next chapter but there is
293.16,3.84,unfortunately a connection there as well
295.12,3.799,autistic people in general are already
297.0,4.08,more likely to experience suicidal
298.919,4.12,ideation and they are more likely to
301.08,5.52,take their own lives one study found
303.039,6.361,that 3.9% of the autistic participants
306.6,5.24,had had a attempt at ending their own
309.4,4.44,lives compared to 0.7% of the
311.84,3.84,non-autistic participants so quite a big
313.84,3.84,difference there these kind of stats are
315.68,4.04,one of the reasons why I find it so
317.68,4.799,upsetting when people try and gatekeep
319.72,4.319,autism or try and undermine how autistic
322.479,4.601,somebody is I just find that one of the
324.039,4.961,most stupid unproductive discussions
327.08,4.119,just because on a surface level somebody
329.0,4.08,seems to have good communication skills
331.199,3.84,and be able to make eye contact that
333.08,4.2,doesn't mean that everything is magical
335.039,4.201,for them yes not all autistic people
337.28,3.759,require full-time care autistic people
339.24,3.6,can have different levels of support
341.039,3.801,needs but that doesn't mean we don't
342.84,3.96,face other risks as a result of our
344.84,3.52,brains being wired differently so yes
346.8,3.28,compensation which is kind of another
348.36,4.2,word that's used for masking sometimes
350.08,4.679,in the research has been found to be a
352.56,4.479,risk marker for autistic people taking
354.759,4.761,their own lives alongside unmet support
357.039,4.241,needs as well so yes all autistic people
359.52,3.6,really do deserve a diagnosis and it
361.28,3.6,would be really wonderful if there was
363.12,3.56,more post- diagnosis support I
364.88,4.159,personally started to have thoughts
366.68,4.12,about wanting to you know not be here
369.039,3.961,anymore probably when I was about 7
370.8,3.959,years old which seems like crazily
373.0,3.52,ridiculously young but I think that's
374.759,3.761,not an uncommon experience for is I
376.52,3.48,think a lot of autistic children do deal
378.52,2.92,with mental health difficulties I mean
380.0,3.479,most autistic children are being forced
381.44,3.599,to go into school every day into a very
383.479,3.84,uncomfortable environment speaking of my
385.039,3.44,school experience burnout is also
387.319,2.72,another mental health issue that
388.479,3.201,autistic people can face as a result of
390.039,3.081,masking autistic burnout is kind of
391.68,3.72,something that can happen if we
393.12,4.0,continuously ignore our own needs and
395.4,3.68,our own boundaries if you're in like a
397.12,3.6,stress response for a very long period
399.08,3.519,of time and it can look a lot like
400.72,3.96,depression you can struggle to do
402.599,4.6,anything basically the national autistic
404.68,4.4,Society list masking as a life stressor
407.199,4.361,which can lead to burnout I experienced
409.08,4.04,autistic burnout in my late teens I have
411.56,4.079,a whole video about it but it was very
413.12,4.12,connected to the very intense masking I
415.639,3.56,was doing at that period of time I was
417.24,4.079,like trying to be an extrovert every day
419.199,3.641,and it basically felt like my nervous
421.319,3.481,system had been put through a paper
422.84,4.039,shredder I kind of just lost my ability
424.8,3.64,to function I had to drop out of six
426.879,3.361,form College despite the fact that I've
428.44,3.84,been predicted good grades and it took
430.24,3.92,me 3 years to feel fully recovered from
432.28,4.039,it as well so once again just because
434.16,3.68,somebody seems fine on the surface as I
436.319,3.481,probably did to my teachers who just
437.84,3.4,thought Oh yay she's doing really well
439.8,3.64,it doesn't mean that somebody isn't
441.24,4.079,reaching a crisis Point Dr Hannah Louise
443.44,3.84,Bel has this flow shot that kind of
445.319,3.28,shows the cycle of masking and how it
447.28,3.12,could lead to burnout which I really
448.599,3.801,like her experience is quite similar to
450.4,4.639,mine she had to drop out of going to
452.4,4.96,Conventional school when she was 14 so
455.039,4.041,it starts with I want people to like me
457.36,3.76,and I want to fit in I have to do what
459.08,3.88,they expect of Me by masking I can't
461.12,4.6,look after myself and meet my own needs
462.96,4.919,too I burn out and go into crisis and
465.72,3.879,then I withdraw from others and then the
467.879,3.841,cycle starts again because you come back
469.599,3.641,to I want people to like me and I want
471.72,3.039,to fit in because you know once you've
473.24,3.079,kind of isolated yourself you're not
474.759,3.12,really fitting in anymore you've kind of
476.319,3.44,shown yourself to be a bit strange at
477.879,4.16,that point so then you have to restart
479.759,4.361,the cycle again like when I left College
482.039,3.6,I absolutely lost friends and I had one
484.12,4.12,friend who had kind of a little bit more
485.639,4.601,of an insight into how I'd been feeling
488.24,4.04,and she was just like noping out of
490.24,3.359,there she was like mm I don't know
492.28,3.08,what's going on with her but I don't
493.599,3.32,want to have anything to do with it so
495.36,3.2,that was kind of the end of that I think
496.919,3.321,monot tropism which I talk about all the
498.56,3.28,time it's a theory of autism I'll leave
500.24,3.679,my video about it linked but it's kind
501.84,3.88,of this idea that autistic people like
503.919,3.601,to focus their attention resources we
505.72,4.159,all have limited attention resources but
507.52,4.959,autistic Minds really like to Focus
509.879,4.361,those attention resources on few things
512.479,3.8,but at a high intensity that is kind of
514.24,3.919,our natural state to be in and so we're
516.279,3.56,monotropic nonautistic people are more
518.159,3.961,polytropic and they distribute their
519.839,4.241,attention more evenly and when you're
522.12,4.279,masking you're performing something that
524.08,5.0,has been called the monotropic split
526.399,4.721,splitting this monotropic attention in a
529.08,3.52,way that's unnatural and uncomfortable
531.12,3.2,and distressing for you like when I
532.6,2.919,described how socializing can be all
534.32,3.759,these different things you've got to
535.519,4.0,focus on many people say that masking is
538.079,3.481,one of the hardest parts of about being
539.519,5.601,autistic and I think that's why it's
541.56,5.12,just extremely unnatural and unintuitive
545.12,3.52,number two the second danger
546.68,4.04,unfortunately masking can also be a
548.64,3.439,safety risk for autistic people in my
550.72,3.52,video on the four different types of
552.079,4.241,masking I focused on foring and people
554.24,4.4,pleasing foring is a threat response you
556.32,4.12,try and be nice and agreeable to
558.64,3.439,whatever is threatening you to kind of
560.44,3.56,make the threat go away a lot of
562.079,4.121,autistic people do it and you can maybe
564.0,3.6,see how this people pleasing would make
566.2,3.199,you vulnerable to people who have
567.6,3.6,ulterior motives particularly as
569.399,3.961,autistic people can be more literal it
571.2,4.319,can make us kind of naive we can assume
573.36,3.8,people mean what they say it can be
575.519,3.401,really difficult for me personally to
577.16,3.4,comprehend that somebody could be lying
578.92,3.44,to me and I find that idea very
580.56,3.2,distressing so autistic people are more
582.36,3.719,likely to experience something called
583.76,3.639,mate crime I certainly know of autistic
586.079,3.32,people who've experienced it I've had
587.399,3.321,instances in my family where people have
589.399,3.521,trusted the wrong people with their
590.72,3.84,money and ended up in bad situations
592.92,3.68,make crime is kind of used instead of
594.56,4.56,hate crime to describe instances where
596.6,4.6,people will Target people who are
599.12,3.64,vulnerable due to their disabilities
601.2,2.8,they often Target people with learning
602.76,3.16,disabilities or intellectual
604.0,3.64,disabilities and also autistic people
605.92,3.919,and then kind of befriend them and then
607.64,4.08,steal from them or manipulate them into
609.839,3.881,doing things for them you can kind of
611.72,4.44,see how somebody who masks a lot
613.72,4.359,somebody who is desperate to be accepted
616.16,4.119,and to be approved of by the people
618.079,4.32,around them and who has learned to make
620.279,4.441,people like them by smiling and being
622.399,4.521,agreeable how somebody could end up in
624.72,3.88,this sort of situation and the difficult
626.92,3.44,thing with autistic people particularly
628.6,3.96,with autistic people who don't look
630.36,3.4,autistic who seem to be quite socially
632.56,3.44,competent because they're good at
633.76,3.879,masking that can kind of hide the fact
636.0,3.72,that they do have a disability that
637.639,4.081,affects their ability to socialize so
639.72,4.239,the people around them might assume they
641.72,4.0,don't need any support in that area and
643.959,3.0,not you know be looking out for them
645.72,3.88,this is a quote from one study that I
646.959,4.641,read recently one participant identified
649.6,3.64,being taken advantage of by a friend in
651.6,3.12,quotation marks I was really close
653.24,3.08,friends with a girl but my dad pointed
654.72,3.28,out that I kept doing things for her but
656.32,3.6,I didn't see it like we'd go for lunch
658.0,4.519,and I'd pay and she she wouldn't pay and
659.92,4.599,I see people on autism Facebook groups
662.519,3.721,and stuff all the time clearly being
664.519,3.161,taken advantage of and kind of asking
666.24,3.64,like am I in the wrong here and it's
667.68,3.92,like a terrible situation like their
669.88,3.44,neighbors are constantly dropping their
671.6,3.6,kids around for free child care and
673.32,3.56,they're like is this normal is this okay
675.2,3.6,am I overreacting by thinking this is
676.88,3.639,weird and the autistic person feeling
678.8,3.68,like maybe they're somehow in the wrong
680.519,3.56,for feeling like uncomfortable with the
682.48,3.479,situation and doubting their own
684.079,3.56,discomfort if you are worried about mate
685.959,3.68,crime I'll leave a link down below to a
687.639,4.121,page on ambitious about or ISM which
689.639,3.921,contains some advice autistic people are
691.76,3.56,also sadly more likely to find
693.56,3.64,themselves in abusive relationships or
695.32,3.72,to be abused by loved ones I think
697.2,3.879,unfortunately it makes a lot of sense
699.04,4.56,for a population of people who have kind
701.079,5.2,of been taught been trained by Society
703.6,4.799,to ignore their own needs and to ignore
706.279,3.601,signals from their own body particularly
708.399,3.201,if they've been masking a lot and
709.88,3.56,internalizing a lot for example if you
711.6,3.44,dealt with sensory issues as you were
713.44,3.24,growing up particularly if you were
715.04,3.919,undiagnosed which a lot of people who
716.68,4.2,mask a lot did go undiagnosed until
718.959,3.601,later in life if you complained about a
720.88,3.519,sensory issue you might have been told
722.56,4.079,you were overreacting that you were too
724.399,3.88,sensitive that your experience was just
726.639,3.801,wrong and then that isn't how it is for
728.279,3.56,everyone else it's just you I think over
730.44,2.759,time we can just give up listening to
731.839,2.921,ourselves and listening to our own
733.199,3.44,bodies and listening to our intuition
734.76,3.68,and just feel like oh I'm wrong that's
736.639,3.921,obviously just a me thing cuz nobody
738.44,3.959,else seems to be complaining this sort
740.56,3.399,of theme of like doubting yourself
742.399,4.161,unfortunately came up quite a lot in
743.959,4.56,this 2023 study that I read on abuse and
746.56,3.639,victimization in autistic people I
748.519,3.361,thought I is misinterpreting myself
750.199,3.521,they're saying this is enjoyable and
751.88,4.079,this is fun but I'm not liking it in
753.72,3.64,general any kind of social situation I
755.959,3.161,always get things wrong and then there
757.36,3.839,was also I grew up being told I was
759.12,4.32,wrong too sensitive too serious not
761.199,4.32,ladylike etc for a long time I wasn't
763.44,4.079,even sure who I was you might think oh
765.519,3.56,yeah well I suppose I am usually the one
767.519,3.601,that's in the wrong and others are
769.079,4.481,usually right so therefore my abuser
771.12,4.8,must be right even when that's not true
773.56,4.92,because many autistic people don't fully
775.92,4.96,understand societal Norms if an abusive
778.48,4.08,person senses that they may be able to
780.88,3.519,Gaslight you and tell you certain things
782.56,3.8,are like perfectly fine and normal
784.399,3.56,everybody does this masking could also
786.36,2.839,lead to risky situations because
787.959,3.24,autistic people might kind of
789.199,4.44,accidentally send out the wrong signals
791.199,4.161,to people for example maybe you smile a
793.639,3.041,lot these days because you were told in
795.36,2.839,the past when you were growing up that
796.68,2.8,your facial expression was too flat and
798.199,3.0,you looked bored all the time or it
799.48,3.08,looked kind of hostile so you know you
801.199,2.961,go over the top with your facial
802.56,3.68,expressions now you could end up
804.16,3.919,overcompensating and smile too much at
806.24,4.159,the wrong person and then they could get
808.079,4.481,the wrong idea could be interpreted as
810.399,3.841,some sort of invitation they might get
812.56,3.519,some sexual ideas in their head or
814.24,3.64,something like that I've often mentioned
816.079,3.601,how there was somebody in my college who
817.88,3.92,just randomly started tickling me and I
819.68,3.44,have no idea why I didn't ask for that
821.8,3.719,but it can be really hard when you're
823.12,4.48,used to just being polite to people as a
825.519,3.88,way to gain social approval my mask when
827.6,4.84,I was a young child was just being the
829.399,4.721,shy but Smiley kind of sweet girl and
832.44,3.519,then when I went to do work experience
834.12,3.44,when I was about 15 sometimes people in
835.959,3.56,the UK in high school will do like a
837.56,3.12,week of work exper experience I kept
839.519,2.601,having to go in and ask them if they
840.68,2.56,wanted te or coffee which was really
842.12,2.92,awkward because they were in the middle
843.24,4.399,of a meeting and they were all talking
845.04,5.2,and I was in the center of a busy City I
847.639,4.801,was followed several times and then I
850.24,4.8,had like men stopping to talk to me I
852.44,4.519,was 15 and I looked younger than I was
855.04,4.4,like what are you doing it was just so
856.959,4.44,hard for me to just not be polite even
859.44,4.48,though I was very uncomfortable but I
861.399,3.88,was like no no I have a boyfriend I
863.92,3.32,don't want to come and have a drink with
865.279,3.56,you I'm actually just you know trying to
867.24,3.959,find the post office I'm working
868.839,4.24,experience it's just so ingrained to be
871.199,3.721,nice to people can be really hard to
873.079,3.32,switch that off cuz there are times
874.92,3.52,where you don't want to be nice to
876.399,3.521,people and where being too nice can kind
878.44,3.56,of get you in trouble and this is
879.92,5.32,obviously not an autistic person's fault
882.0,4.92,none of this no abuse is ever your fault
885.24,3.36,and sometimes you know you do just cross
886.92,3.359,PA pass with the wrong person autistic
888.6,4.2,women who are sometimes shown in some
890.279,4.8,studies to mask more than autistic men
892.8,4.68,I've read 80% and then I've also read
895.079,4.56,nine out of 10 have been subjected to
897.48,3.919,some sort of you know domestic or sexual
899.639,3.601,abuse and when you think about the fact
901.399,3.761,that the main therapy for autistic
903.24,3.76,people who are kind of diagnosed earlier
905.16,4.16,in life the gold standard is kind of
907.0,4.92,still ABA therapy which has a big
909.32,4.04,emphasis on compliance it's no wonder
911.92,3.039,that autistic people might feel like
913.36,3.52,they just can't say know that they don't
914.959,3.721,have the right to say no in certain
916.88,4.319,scenarios and obviously this is not as
918.68,3.68,serious as any sort of abuse but I often
921.199,4.161,particularly when I first started my
922.36,5.08,videography business I did end up in bad
925.36,4.24,situations with clients because they'd
927.44,4.04,got me on the phone and cuz I'm so like
929.6,3.679,conscious of masking and coming across
931.48,3.839,well on the phone I'd agreed to things
933.279,4.081,agreed to prices that were just not
935.319,4.121,suitable at one point I literally ended
937.36,5.36,up filming four events and I ended up
939.44,6.12,with profits of £25 from filming four
942.72,5.039,different long events like how how does
945.56,4.0,that happen I just find that when I'm in
947.759,3.121,this masking state it feels very like
949.56,2.88,kind of a survival response that
950.88,3.68,switches on it's not entirely in my
952.44,4.199,control I can just try and say the
954.56,4.04,nicest thing possible or I can be in
956.639,3.361,mode of like I want people to like me
958.6,2.88,I'm going to say whatever is going to
960.0,3.079,make them like me and I don't really
961.48,3.2,entirely think things through and things
963.079,3.44,just like BL out of my mouth and I just
964.68,3.44,feel the silences you're allowed to slow
966.519,2.841,down you're allowed to have pauses and
968.12,2.639,you're allowed to say I need some more
969.36,3.68,time to think about that no matter what
970.759,3.801,it is unless you know it's really the
973.04,3.239,life or death decision that has to be
974.56,3.48,made and that's but second but most
976.279,3.68,things you're allowed time to think
978.04,3.719,about it and to maybe go away in a
979.959,4.041,private space number three another
981.759,4.361,danger of masking is losing your sense
984.0,3.88,of self masking can literally feel like
986.12,3.959,going out every day and playing a
987.88,3.959,character and performing a script and if
990.079,3.44,people want to like you and be your
991.839,3.881,friend well then yay that's great I
993.519,4.921,guess the maskings worked but it's not
995.72,4.52,really you so are they really friends
998.44,3.56,with you you know if you start masking
1000.24,3.279,around someone chances are unless you
1002.0,3.12,get super close with them you're going
1003.519,3.32,to feel like you need to mask around
1005.12,3.48,them all the time the people who I was
1006.839,3.881,friends with at school I didn't see that
1008.6,4.239,often outside of school sometimes I
1010.72,3.799,would but I would find it kind of
1012.839,3.401,exhausting to see those people outside
1014.519,3.601,of school and now I recognize well they
1016.24,3.32,were kind of connected to my mask self
1018.12,3.36,my school School self so I felt like I
1019.56,3.92,had to continue that and it didn't feel
1021.48,4.16,the same as when I saw the people who I
1023.48,4.24,knew solely outside of school who didn't
1025.64,4.12,know the masked me who I spent time with
1027.72,3.68,one-on-one who got to know the real me a
1029.76,3.559,little bit more so like I had a close
1031.4,3.559,friend that I made at ballet my mom
1033.319,3.561,helped me make friends with her and my
1034.959,3.441,cousins my my younger cousins were who I
1036.88,3.919,spent most of my time with outside of
1038.4,4.48,school did feel like School self and
1040.799,3.481,home self were two very different people
1042.88,3.12,and even when I went to my dad's house
1044.28,3.519,every second weekend it was more like
1046.0,3.16,School self that went to my dad's house
1047.799,3.441,every second week weekend there's a
1049.16,4.04,study where moms of autistic girls were
1051.24,3.439,asked about their children's masking she
1053.2,3.12,was like Jackel and Hyde because she
1054.679,3.561,would be lovely and excited and the
1056.32,3.64,minute we got home it was just awful and
1058.24,3.6,then she would scream and then she would
1059.96,4.04,sleep which I thought was great but now
1061.84,3.959,I realize how exhausted she must be I
1064.0,3.64,don't know about you but my close family
1065.799,3.561,also used this kind of Jackal andh High
1067.64,3.64,comparison for me for sure when I was
1069.36,3.92,younger really affected my self-esteem
1071.28,4.519,at the time because I had no idea why it
1073.28,4.279,was happening why am I such a bad person
1075.799,3.561,when I'm at home compared to you know
1077.559,3.961,how nice I am when I'm at school I'm
1079.36,4.08,such a nice person at school having this
1081.52,4.12,kind of fragmented identity doesn't feel
1083.44,3.96,great and I think this can be one of the
1085.64,3.56,major reasons for the depression that I
1087.4,3.56,spoke about in the first point I think
1089.2,3.599,masking can make social interactions
1090.96,3.88,even and maybe especially when they're
1092.799,3.641,going really well feel really lonely
1094.84,3.36,because nobody really knows you and it
1096.44,3.44,feels like it's impossible for them to
1098.2,3.16,ever really know you particularly once
1099.88,3.24,you've already kind of committed to
1101.36,3.439,masking around them it's very difficult
1103.12,3.76,to then dismantle that in the book
1104.799,4.12,autism and masking one autistic person
1106.88,3.679,speaks about how masking them to a
1108.919,3.561,mental health breakdown and being
1110.559,4.12,admitted to a mental health unit they
1112.48,4.36,said I saw no way of living as the real
1114.679,4.041,me I knew difference wasn't good and I
1116.84,3.36,was so scared of not fitting in with
1118.72,4.16,masking there's kind of always this
1120.2,5.24,hovering risk of being ostracized if you
1122.88,4.36,don't mask or if you kind of slip up but
1125.44,3.2,then if you do mask I've seen it
1127.24,3.6,described as kind of a self
1128.64,3.96,ostracization you're saying I'm not good
1130.84,3.6,enough who I am is not good enough my
1132.6,3.959,true self is not fit for human
1134.44,3.56,consumption it's not a great feeling I
1136.559,3.6,think I've personally struggled even
1138.0,4.24,more with this identity stuff post
1140.159,3.88,diagnosis sadly and maybe it's just
1142.24,2.919,something that I'm going to kind of get
1144.039,3.081,through eventually I don't know if
1145.159,4.4,anyone else can relate to this it's just
1147.12,4.96,really difficult to have to come out to
1149.559,4.441,people in your life about being autistic
1152.08,4.12,and just kind of worry about not being
1154.0,4.44,believed you're kind of working against
1156.2,3.719,your own mask you're like trying to undo
1158.44,3.359,this hard work that you've done for
1159.919,4.081,years to come across it's like not weird
1161.799,4.201,not weird and then you're like no look I
1164.0,3.799,I am actually weird I promise I'm really
1166.0,3.96,weird look at all this weird stuff that
1167.799,4.481,I've done had tears in my eyes when I
1169.96,4.32,found this quote on Embrace autism while
1172.28,3.639,your constructed self may excel in the
1174.28,3.6,social domain at the end of the day
1175.919,4.041,there is no energy left to nurture the
1177.88,3.76,true self what place is left for the
1179.96,3.64,true self other than to be hidden deep
1181.64,4.08,within you not to be seen by most or
1183.6,4.199,indeed forever shielded from every other
1185.72,4.0,person the constructed you takes over
1187.799,4.041,and is living while deep inside the
1189.72,3.92,genuine you is struggling and withering
1191.84,4.199,away so number four masking kind of
1193.64,4.6,wanting to fit in could lead some people
1196.039,3.921,to alcohol and drug addiction now this
1198.24,3.16,obviously won't affect every autistic
1199.96,2.839,person obviously none of these things
1201.4,3.36,will affect every autistic person and
1202.799,3.561,not every autistic person masks as well
1204.76,3.399,so that's always important to remember
1206.36,3.28,there's kind of some mixed data on this
1208.159,3.441,one there are some data to suggest that
1209.64,4.039,autistic people who mask more might be
1211.6,4.079,less likely to drink but anecdotally I
1213.679,4.36,know some autistic people do struggle
1215.679,5.081,with drugs and alcohol I know that I
1218.039,5.12,personally sadly have had some of my
1220.76,5.48,favorite social interactions while I was
1223.159,5.841,drunk I was 19 the first time I was
1226.24,5.559,drunk which is like really old in the UK
1229.0,4.799,it's legal from 18 but a lot of us tend
1231.799,4.0,to drink a lot earlier than that I just
1233.799,3.921,remember I really enjoyed the way it
1235.799,3.721,kind of got rid of my mask to some
1237.72,3.56,extent like I lost some of that social
1239.52,4.2,anxiety some of that overthinking and I
1241.28,4.0,just kind of said things and was able to
1243.72,3.52,be a little bit more confident in the
1245.28,3.639,way I might have liked to be otherwise
1247.24,3.439,and for a while I was like oh everybody
1248.919,3.481,does accept me it's just me being too
1250.679,3.48,shy like when I actually speak everyone
1252.4,3.519,is really lovely but then later on I
1254.159,3.561,kind of realized oh yeah well everyone's
1255.919,3.721,lovely cuz they're drunk as well so
1257.72,4.439,they're not not noticing little
1259.64,4.159,differences and like Oddities about you
1262.159,3.161,you know they're not going to notice if
1263.799,2.961,the mask slips and if it does they're
1265.32,2.839,just going to think oh well she's drunk
1266.76,3.56,and I'm drunk and everyone's drunk and
1268.159,4.321,let's have a good time so it was kind of
1270.32,3.76,a freeing experience obviously there
1272.48,3.92,were things that I don't like about
1274.08,3.68,drinking from an autistic perspective
1276.4,3.36,like it can make you feel very weird in
1277.76,4.48,your own body and then also control lack
1279.76,4.36,of control and you can end up cringing
1282.24,3.919,massively about what the hell did I do
1284.12,4.24,when I was so drunk and on mask last
1286.159,4.0,night and it can be very very painful so
1288.36,3.799,the older I get I feel like the worse
1290.159,4.681,that kind of next day anxiety gets there
1292.159,4.0,was a survey of 507 autistic people and
1294.84,3.52,one of the reasons for drinking that
1296.159,4.12,autistic people gave was alcohol makes
1298.36,3.6,verbal communication easier and the
1300.279,3.561,people who drank heavily said they drank
1301.96,4.64,heavily for social reasons and I watched
1303.84,4.8,a talk recently from an autistic guy who
1306.6,3.199,struggled with alcoholism as well and he
1308.64,2.88,drank to kind of get through the work
1309.799,3.161,day he kind of wondered why doesn't
1311.52,2.68,everybody drink why isn't everybody
1312.96,2.8,drinking to get through because he
1314.2,3.359,thought everybody dealt with as much
1315.76,4.2,anxiety as he did and then he was only
1317.559,4.72,diagnosed is autistic in his 40s so is
1319.96,5.0,masking all bad I saw this post recently
1322.279,4.361,on Facebook from Sally cat PDA I am my
1324.96,3.52,mask and that's okay there's a lot of
1326.64,3.36,talk about dropping masks but this isn't
1328.48,3.28,something that works for me dropping my
1330.0,3.559,mask takes huge effort and it feels
1331.76,4.519,horrific I don't think all types of
1333.559,4.6,masking are the same and I was like yeah
1336.279,3.841,particularly for somebody who identifies
1338.159,3.52,with the PDA profile pathological demand
1340.12,2.799,avoidance I have a video All About That
1341.679,2.401,if you don't know what that is it kind
1342.919,2.921,of made sense there was somebody who
1344.08,3.92,fits that profile like the way that we
1345.84,3.52,talk about un masking sometimes in the
1348.0,3.6,autistic Community like somebody just
1349.36,4.12,needs to rip the mask off and just step
1351.6,4.48,into the light step into their autistic
1353.48,4.16,self that might feel pretty demanding to
1356.08,3.68,somebody who's a PDA and to many
1357.64,3.919,autistic people and very high pressured
1359.76,3.399,if you spent years building up this mask
1361.559,3.24,you can't expect yourself to be able to
1363.159,3.561,just tear it down overnight that feels
1364.799,3.921,unrealistic to me and a lot of it is a
1366.72,3.76,really deeply ingrained survival
1368.72,3.199,response a lot of it feels like it's out
1370.48,3.439,of my control there's been many times
1371.919,5.401,where I've been like I wish I could mask
1373.919,5.281,less and I just can't do it you know and
1377.32,4.08,it's not that simple in black and white
1379.2,3.959,that masking is bad and unmasking is
1381.4,3.72,good particularly in this world that we
1383.159,3.64,live in an ability to mask can be seen
1385.12,3.48,as a privilege it can help you to Le
1386.799,3.841,jobs it can help you to get into
1388.6,4.04,relationships it's not necessarily going
1390.64,3.919,to benefit you positively to drop it
1392.64,4.32,completely but what I do think is that
1394.559,5.0,masking should be done in moderation as
1396.96,4.56,with point four alcohol moderation the
1399.559,3.801,national autistic Society has this page
1401.52,3.36,about reducing burnout which I really
1403.36,3.28,really like and I've mentioned it
1404.88,3.399,numerous times on the channel and it
1406.64,3.68,kind of talks about just letting us s be
1408.279,4.081,autistic spending time on your own or
1410.32,4.52,spending time around people who let you
1412.36,4.199,be autistic let yourself stem Anything
1414.84,3.8,You Can Do I think to move yourself
1416.559,4.521,towards a life that's going to allow for
1418.64,4.24,more recovery time is probably going to
1421.08,3.479,benefit you mentally if it is possible
1422.88,3.08,to do that engage in your interests
1424.559,2.6,spend time with people who are never
1425.96,2.68,going to call your names who are never
1427.159,3.561,going to call you weird no matter what
1428.64,3.84,you do let yourself be autistic and if
1430.72,3.48,you're not sure what being autistic
1432.48,3.36,means then you might enjoy this video
1434.2,3.359,about the theory of monot tropism my
1435.84,3.28,favorite theory of what autism is I
1437.559,3.561,think it's a a great way to understand
1439.12,4.159,autism for yourself and to maybe explain
1441.12,3.72,it to family members if you enjoyed this
1443.279,2.801,video and you want to see more like it
1444.84,4.079,but maybe you've seen everything on the
1446.08,5.16,channel already for $4 us you can join
1448.919,4.721,my patreon and I do two exclusive videos
1451.24,5.0,a month over there the last one was a 53
1453.64,4.6,minute Q&A with my husband and I also
1456.24,3.679,before that reacted to like the weirdest
1458.24,3.24,stock that I found while making these
1459.919,2.961,videos and there's also a Discord server
1461.48,2.92,that you can join even on the lowest
1462.88,2.96,tier you can get in the Discord server
1464.4,3.12,and you can chat with other neurod
1465.84,3.199,Divergent people and people who think
1467.52,3.8,they could possibly be autistic you
1469.039,3.961,don't have to be autistic you can be
1471.32,3.28,anything just got to be nice just got to
1473.0,2.96,be kind before I go I just want to say
1474.6,3.319,thank you so much for your support it's
