"I don't have major depression....I think it's more like chronic depression.  Nothing's fun.  Nothing's worth doing.  I think if I were to win the lottery I'd just breathe a sigh of relief and be glad that bullshit is over with.  Wouldn't make me happy though.  I question sometimes (rationally) the point in living.  I mean, sure, to have children and make an impact on the world is probably the best reasons for living, but is that going to actually matter?  This shithole is already overpopulated and there's not much one person can change.  

I'm not suicidal, I have plans, but I don't think they'll have any profound effect.  I could lie on train tracks and it wouldn't make a difference in the grand scheme of things.  I could continue living and maybe enjoy decimating this planet some more.  I mean, I'm just one person, but I contribute to everything.  For good or for bad, I'm not really going to leave a mark.  My life doesn't matter, that's truth.

Now, *I think* the difference between major depression and chronic depression is that I live with this reality, whereas for a manic depressive all of these feelings hit them like a ton of bricks.  It's different for everyone, but mine is a long-lasting, mild type.  I can at least get out of bed to eat some eggs and cheese, even if I do feel it's pointless."
"Sometimes I'll be really hungry, but the idea of simply going to the kitchen and making food seems like too much work."
"You feel so hopeless and disgusted with yourself. You eventually start giving up because, when you're that damn sad, you're sad. Everything hurts from past memories to new ones that burn your skin."
"[A daughter explaining depression to her mother] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqu4ezLQEUA)

This video was spot on for me. 

Also, never underestimate the power of just being there for your SO.  Ask them what is helpful; do they want you to sit with them in bed? To force them to take a shower? To reassure them that you love them? 

And to echo the others, professional help.  Preferably with a well-regarded therapist (I prefer ones who specialize in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and possibly also a psychiatrist for medication. "

"I suffered with major depression (with psychotic tendencies) in my late teens, which led to an attempted suicide. 

It's really hard to explain but I just felt like my life was pointless, that the people around me would be better off if I were dead and that I was just a burden on my ex-boyfriend, friends and family. There were days when I wouldn't get out of bed, not even to shower. I locked myself away from everybody and convinced myself they didn't care anyway. I failed school, I had no libido, I dropped about 45 pounds (I was about 140 pounds before my depression), I couldn't watch tv because it bored me, I couldn't eat, I was constantly dehydrated and I was in complete denial. Whenever anybody would ask how I was doing, I would smile and say 'yeah, really good'. I just didn't want to bother people. 
I was also very risk-taking. I would get stupid drunk or drugged-up and get myself into dangerous situations. This led to the overdose. I decided one evening that it would be a good idea to drink myself to death and take about 180 pills (a mixture of codeine, paracetamol, caffeine pills, allergy meds, ephedrine.. you name it). The night was a blurr, I didn't pass out.. a friend was around and he drove me home. Thankfully I'd started vomiting by that time. 

In the morning, I couldn't keep anything down. Not even water. I couldn't urinate. I felt sick. My whole abdomen felt searing. It was in that moment I realised I didn't want to die. I got my grandfather to take me to A&E where I admitted to what I had done and was put on a drip for a week due to my liver failing. 

I lost the trust of my family, my friends and my ex-boyfriend dumped me on my hospital bed. After I recovered, I was still very messed up, quite traumatised. I was over 18 when I overdosed and in the UK that means that they don't need to support you. I was literally given a leaflet and told to go home. I could have easily attempted suicide again, but a little voice in my head told me to change. 

Without medications or therapy, I managed to recover on my own. It took a long time (about two years) but it was worth it. I just travelled alot, made time for myself, started to care for myself, read alot and admitted my problems.

Today I am 22 yo, studying Psychology, married, living away and my depression is classified as mild (sometimes it gets worse but I can talk myself out of it). Turns out there is a light at the end of a tunnel :)

"It's weight. It sits on your chest. Depression throws the anchor over board. Interests in every aspect of life dissipate, even hunger. It all becomes very stagnant and murky. The word that comes to mind is hopelessness, but even that implies that there is an internal resolve that will cater to the pulling of yourself out of that depth. To find hope. Major depression does not acknowledge that resolve.

I'd suggest having your SO seek professional help. Talk to someone who has an outside of the box perspective. Get the most suitable medication and therapy available.



"
"Had a short (a few months) bout a while back, wasn't a major case I think.

It didn't even hurt, it's just your new normal. When you're well, you don't really remember what having the cold is like. You know it abstractly but you can't really recall what *being* sick is like.

It's like that, everything around you is just the way it is. You can't really understand feeling better because it doesn't make sense, you hurt and that is the way it is. You just want to not bother anyone and stay out of the way, you're only ever a burden. You don't want to kill yourself, but living is just to much work. It's easier to just lay down and stay out of the way.

You eat because you know you have to, and you go through the motions of other tasks, but things fail to come together."
"It's not that I are or were sad, but I am in a melancholic state of mind. I lacked motivation to do anything exciting, like getting up and smell coffee in the morning  or go out and excercise. I also suffer from sleep deprivation as a result of the depression. 

It is really hard to give any advice on how to help her pull through, because every case of depression or major depression has different symptoms and how it affect a person. Proffesional help is maybe a solution. For me it worked to speak with my personal doctor, he helped me get medications to fight sleep deprivation and gave me advice on how to push new boundaries to help motivate myself. I wasn't even aware that I had a depression until he told me that I was on a crash course, and that was 8 years after I first experienced the symptoms. 

Be careful on how you approach this with your SO, it can be a very personal and a very touchy area. That is probably the best advice I can give you on the matter."
"I have disthymia. 

Nothing motivates me. Nothing interests me. I struggle to get up because I feel tired all the time, and then when I can't I'm disgusted with myself. I feel so useless and pointless."
"It's hard to explain. 

I would isolate myself whenever I got depressed. And it would last so long. I had depression end of middle school and my whole high school years. Sometimes I wouldn't even know the reason why I am so upset. My ex would always ask me what's wrong and I would shrug cause I don't know. A wave would hit me. I lost motivation to do things I loved to do. I couldn't sleep well. 

Then it would get to the point where I was just numb. I wouldn't eat for days. My stomach would scream for food but I wouldn't feel hunger. I didn't give a shit about anything. Didn't talk to my parents, and stayed in my room. It was hard to picture why I am still alive when everyday was the same, wake up and feeling nothing. But I was also to scared to let myself be happy, once I notice I was happy, I would get depressed. I don't know how I would comfort my SO if they were in my position. But my ex helped me get through depression by just being there. He used to be depressed and used to harm himself like me. He also helped with my eating disorder.

I was so good at hiding it though, because that is how people saw me. People knew me as the girl who smiled all the time and laughed at the littlest things."

"My depression is almost like a living thing, it wants to survive, and thrive. It will try and trick me into believing that things will never get better, or that even if they do I won't be happy. It will tell me that the good things in life aren't that good and that everything is meaningless. It will build walls around me and keep me from seeing anything outside of my depression. It tells me I'm worthless. It tells me I'm stupid. It tells me to stay in bed. It tells me I'll be better off dead. 

I still get up every day and go to work. I do it because at some point in my late 20s I realized that this wasn't something everyone goes through. It wasn't ennui, or angst, and I did deserve better. 

I can tell you right now, there is no chance in any way, shape, or form that you can ""pull your SO out of this. They need professional help. They will only get better when they want to take those steps to get better. You can suggest they get that help but by no means can you save them, or force them into getting it. Just be supportive, and understanding and patient. 

TL:DR, suggest your SO seek out professional help, be supportive, and remember that they can't change until they choose to."
"I hate it, Then I hate myself, but I love it...... because it makes me feel alive...,but I hate it."
"I can't even remember where I found this, or who to credit it to, but I seen this piece of text somewhere that just made me feel something in my chest when I read it. It describes perfectly to me how I've felt. 


""You asked me how depression felt, and this is all I could come up with. 


It feels like
I'm walking upstream
through a current strong enough
to pull me under four times over. 


There are others with me,
but they are walking along the banks
telling me to ""Just get out of the water.""
But instead of extending a hand in help,
they just move on and leave me behind. 


Every once in a while I find a rock
that is strong enough for me to lean on,
and I can rest for a bit. 


But the rocks always get tired of holding me up,
and when they let go I'm left drowning -thrown 50ft back again. 


And nothing is harder
than standing up in that current,
when everything in you
is telling you how much easier everything would be, 
if you just let yourself get dragged under."""
"I'll address the experience of trying to talk to my friends about it, since plenty others have commented on the experience itself.

First and foremost:  

You don't know what it's like.  That's not an attack or an accusation, it's something you have to remember.  Depression isn't like that time you were super bummed or stressed out,  and you really can't just will it away.

The thing that bother me most when I reach out to non-depressed loved ones is that they never really 'get it',  but they always think they do, mainly because it's a difficult experience to convey, especially when the terminology is also commonly used to explain more transitory experiences that everyone experiences.  You have to remind yourself that just because it's SOUNDS like something you've experienced, it isn't.  

The easiest way I can explain this is:  if you are about to say something starting with ""you just have to..."",  you've got it wrong.

A person with depression can't ""just"" anything when it comes to dealing with depression.  They can't ""just let it go"" they can't ""just tell yourself X"".

Also, please please please don't fall into the trap of telling them things they should ""be happy about"".  They know.  Depression isn't a lack of perspective,  and these statements usually just make them feel worse, like ""You don't have the right to be depressed"".

Every case it a little different, though, and this may not apply to everyone,  but the basic idea that you need to understand is that no matter how similar something they're describing sounds to something you've experienced, the 'solution' is not going to be the same, especially if the 'solution' is just to 'buck up' or somehow WILL the depression away.  It doesn't work like that."
"I have a really extensive history of it but I don't want to overshare, so I won't go for anything too intense. Something that really sucks about the big depressive periods for me though, the ones that last for very long amounts of time, is that while talking your issues through with someone can feel amazing, like taking a huge weight off your shoulders, you also get this awful crushing guilt from it. 

You get some temporary relief from your shit, after keeping it bottled up for so long, and then it comes back to haunt you. No matter what you say to that person from then on, you feel like a huge burden and always feel like you're just an annoyance in their life for putting your problems onto them.

You're a good person for trying to be there and help your SO, for sure. I hope that they can get the help they need and pull through."
"Mine is more of a mind-set that God hates me, or is punishing me.  Not just passively ignoring, but actively out to hurt me.   The man I love choose someone else; I don’t get to have that life I wanted, I don’t get to be happy, Gods doing.   Why should I bother trying to do anything if God is not going to let me have it.   I mean seriously, if God doesn’t care, what’s the damn point?  That is my mind set right now.    And in case anyone’s wondering, yes, I started therapy last week.  "
"On point with those that said seeking professional help, if she hasn't already. I dealt with a relentlessly deep depression for over 15 years before I finally mustered up the courage to tell someone (my mom) that I truly felt like I couldn't hang on anymore - like I was dead but physically alive. I didn't see a meaning in living, and living day to day was work. I wanted to just end my ""life"" for years but didn't know how. (Side note: In a way I still have this feeling today - I really don't see a point in life and every day is just sort of like, ""Okay... I'm here... ugh."" and if I died today it would be a relief and I wouldn't regret it. The difference is the depression feelings just aren't there anymore.) The best way to describe the actual feeling of the depression is to picture a clothesline running through the inside of your chest; then picture one of those giant, 1000 lb. anvils like in the roadrunner cartoons hanging from it down through the center of you. It feels like your insides weigh a million pounds and could cave in at any moment. Any time I was in a situation where I was supposed to be happy, I had to fake it. I tried so hard to find some enjoyment in good times, but I just couldn't. When I was younger I would stay home from school and just cry and cry for no particular reason all day long. Depression does run in my family, but it was also a result of situations I was experiencing in life as well. Anyway, I finally went to a psychiatrist and was officially diagnosed with the depression and a mood disorder (which we had already suspected). I'm not big on taking medication at all, but decided to try one out for just the mood disorder and see if that helped the depression at all. Luckily it did. After a few months on the medication, it felt like that anvil wasn't there anymore and that my ""normal"" mood was at an even keel rather than under rock bottom and 50 feet of sh*t. Depression can feel different for everyone, but there's always the underlying theme of complete despair and misery. It's really great that you're asking first-hand experience to try to get an idea of what your special someone is going through - props to you for really caring and actually wanting to help."
"I like to think of myself as a problem solver, and the biggest problem in my life is me. Very hard to justify the immense drain I am on the world around me, feel guilty for burdening everybody. Just want to hide, just want to go away."

Sleeping is an issue with my depression it gets to a point where i over think things that i said or did years ago. And end up not sleeping for a day and a half or so and just pass out from exhaustion. And then there's days where getting out of bed is just to much.
"Well the only thing u can do is be there for her and try to make her forget the world ... Forget the problems .. Thats the best .. However sadly somtimes with as much professional health and as much love as there ultimately u have to pull trough by yourself , u have to find things to are worth living for , and u have to convince yourself that things will get better in the future , cause thats the tricks about depressions, they trick u into believing that things will always stay the same , that u will never get happy , that u are one of the chosens to be unhappy . And ultimately its this that traps u there  , until when u realize it isnt all about happiness but about having a path worth living , a path of your own .until are at peace with yourself u will be traped there .. All u can do is just in my opinion is just be there for her make her forget,  do stuff ,  make her arrive late at night in bed so that  shes tired ... Cause thats many time in those moments when u are talking by yourself that the real agony is . The forgetting fells so good , makes u feel alive . But each case is a case , and to each person and problem there may be a diferrent way to pull trough .and medicine  dont cure , they are like band aids to the problem but they let u have a emotional stability to maybe help u pull trough  
Sorry not native speaker sorry for any mistakes "
"You can't just pull someone through depression. that's not how it works. It's a chemical imbalance in their brain that causes them to irrationally feel sad and depressed. This misconception is one of the most damaging to people suffering with the condition.

I have suffered with what I consider mild depression for years. I go untreated because frankly the antidepressants seem very risky to me, but it is still an enormous pain in the ass.

You wake up in the morning and don't see any reason to get out of bed. Who cares if you're late to work/school? nobody would miss you if you didn't show up. You have to will yourself up because you know it's not true and people would be pissed if you didn't show etc...

It's really hard to have solid relationships because you feel sad all the time about stupid things like your appearance not being perfect or if you say something dumb or you'll think people hate you because they didn't return a call immediately or other stupid crap that is completely irrational.

Sometimes you sort of lose control of your emotions where things just feel awful. When I was 19 I got dumped by my girlfriend of 3 years that I was head over heels for. I stopped talking to everyone and just became a recluse, not leaving my apartment for over a week before my parents showed up and banged on my door until I let them in. They drove the 4 hours up when they found out. (FYI people who are friends to depressed people it does help when you show a bit of compassion even if it is annoying and a pain)

Any negative event just gets multiplied by 1000 because you lose the ability to see what is reasonable unless you really focus or have someone to talk to about it. 

So if you want to help your partner with their depression just be there to talk to and be mindful of any needlessly cruel things you say or do. "
Randomly crying and being overwhelmed with feelings of uncontrollable sadness for no apparent reason.
"I suffered (and am in treatment for) major depression.  I was so shut down emotionally that when my Dad died it barely registered.  My wife eventually left me because she couldn't handle being around me.  I sort of understand because depressed people do suck to be around, but still.  

Anyway, the more important question is what you can do to help your SO.  Here's some stuff that would have helped me and might have saved my marriage:

(1) Taking the initiative and scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist for me.  When you are depressed even simple stuff like making an appointment can seem overwhelming.  Obviously you talk with her first rather than just springing it on her.  And take her to the appointment if you can - it's too easy to just sit like a lump and let these things pass by.

(2) Helping me get some exercise.  Exercise plus SSRIs plus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is what eventually pulled me out of the pit I was in.  Even just taking a regular long walk together would help.

(3) Run interference with other people who might be making demands on me.  When you are depressed even simple tasks are hard, so anything that lightens the load helps free up limited mental and emotional resources to fight the disease.

One other thing:  pay attention to her mood.  If she suddenly gets happy, watch her like a hawk.  Getting shot of depression is a slow process.  Sometimes when a depressed person resolves to go forward with committing suicide the sudden realization that all their problems will be over soon is enough to lift the immediate sense of gloom and leave them happy and relieved.

Good luck.  I know being partnered with a depressed person is a dozen kinds of shitty every day.  It sounds to me like you are doing the right thing by reaching out for insight and support so you can be there for her in appropriate ways."
"When I was in the midst of it, generally a lack of hope. I couldn't enjoy a nice sunny day because it seemed somehow sinister, and I think my perception of colors may have been altered? There was not just persistent sadness, there was a feeling that I would never again experience happiness and there was little point to being around. It helped for a time to become more physically active but because I was working a very toxic job and PTSD came into play, my efforts were overwhelmed which only fed it with feelings of failure and worthlessness, mixed up with symptoms of PTSD which amplified it and some of which seemed to taunt me. So, yay Lexapro! It helped the depression enormously, although the PTSD symptoms have needed additional work with EMDR. 

It's hard to explain in some ways but perceptions were altered, view of the world was altered, cognition was altered. "
"Genuinely thought I was dead for a year, and was convinced that this was hell or purgatory. Convinced myself that if my friend from the north visited and left, I was still alive. Friend was very confused when I was suddenly very chipper when talking to him on the phone when he had just spent a week hanging out with uber depressed me. Also lost my faith over that year. Got faith again now."
"I was in a terribly abusive relationship that left me in a crushing state of depression. I'm not sure if I have words for what it's like to be at the bottom of that barrel. Eventually I got out and started rebuilding. Now I'm married to a wonderful woman, and I can say it is like being a different person. When you're depressed I mean. "
"I would like to point out that it is important to watch the development of the person in question. A lot of people with depression can't judge realistically their condition. It comes very slowly and one day, you realize that it is not the case that ""everybody is sad sometimes"", but in reality you can't remember the last time you were happy. "
"The comic/blog from Hyperbole and A Half called Adventures in Depression does a pretty decent job of explaining it in such a way that people who haven't gone through depression can understand it.

Edit: words"
"I am currently very depressed and in a relationship with someone.

First things first. You cannot fix her or cure her. This is very frustrating because people tend to want to help and fix problems. My SO just wants to help me but can't. All you can really do is support them and be there for them when they need help with something. She helps me with things I cannot do, like making phone calls, scheduling things, cleaning my room, getting me up in the morning.

Try to understand that she can't just ""be positive"" or ""stop being depressed"" It is a real illness and while sometimes it will go away given enough time, it requires medication and/or therapy to improve the condition. Know that her feelings for you may vanish. People who are seriously depressed may have no romantic interest at all. They may be so consumed with trying not to want to kill themselves or be miserable all the time that they can't even think about a relationship.

It is very difficult to be in a relationship with someone who is seriously depressed as it can seem like they don't care about you, are always negative, and are draining to be around. I give you credit for hanging in there with her. Just try to do what you can to make her life easier. You can't fix the depression, but you can help her with things she struggles with."
"I think it's great that you're supportive of her. It really does mean a lot to someone who suffers. 

You'll need to learn the fine art of working out when things are too much, and when they need encouragement to do things. Sometimes, people with depression need a bit of a push to go out and do things, other times they physically cannot do anything. Be sure to communicate clearly with them so that you can both know what needs to be done ;)"
"I've had major depression. Try to find ways to distract her, find ways to get her to laugh, and don't try to convince her not to be depressed. For me when people tried to do that all it did was make me aggravated. Give it time overall and tell her you love her. /r/depression could help to. I haven't been there though, was depressed before I knew about Reddit. "
"I have depression, although I'm not sure which specific 'type'. I hope you don't mind me still answering the question though. Everything I'm sharing is only my *personal* experience; everyone is different. 

A lot of users have already shared what it feels like, so I won't talk too much about that. Here's my analogy, though: It feels like you're a gray, dirty, crumbling wall. Vandals spray vulgar words on you (your inner monologue of self-hatred), and there's no way to get rid of them. You're a wall, you're stuck – even if you *wanted* to get rid of the words (after all, depression saps all of your motivation to do anything, even the simplest or most usually-fun tasks), you can't move. You're so full of cracks that it feels like you're about to crumble apart. In fact, that would be much easier than straining to survive. 

You're asking about experiences, so here's my personal story. I'm in high school, and got diagnosed about a month ago. My parents started noticing my low mood around December, over winter break. I was failing – *did* fail – at least one class, with Ds in two others. Last semester, I got an incomplete in English, and am still making up the work (if I don't get at least a C, I won't be able to graduate high school). Before my parents knew I was depressed, they tried everything to get me to do my work. They took away summer activities, a school trip I had planned, would ban me from using my computer... Nothing worked. Nothing interested me. It didn't matter that I'd lose those privileges, because I'd probably just fail anyway, no matter what I did.

After winter break was over, my parents took my to see a psychiatrist. It was hard to be 100% honest with him, since I'm pretty private about my emotions, and he told me I had dysthymia. My parents and I didn't really agree with his diagnosis (like I said, I wasn't completely honest with him), but it was enough to get me medicated. I hated, and still hate, the idea of having to rely on pills for my happiness. They still haven't completely set in (I have more energy now, but I'm still unhappy), and at times it seems like the medication is pointless. I once forgot to take my medication, and was freaking out. When nothing happened for a few hours, I wondered why I was being medicated in the first place. I managed to get my medication before my mood could plummet, luckily. I've been on pills for a month.

I've also been going to therapy; I've only had four sessions so far. I'm going to be completely honest with you... I hate therapy. I dread it, and that's because I'm absolutely terrified of showing my vulnerability. I'm (irrationally) afraid of being judged, or pinned as insane (what if I'm 'crazier' than I thought?). It's really difficult, and I'd like to quit, but I'm sticking with it. 

In my experience, my best friend has been my biggest source of comfort. I find it best when she simply listens to me; I'd rather not be given advice. Even if talking to her is helpful, she still can't relate, and sometimes that feels very lonely. Just be there to support your SO.

"
"I'm going through an episode right now, actually.  Going on sites like Reddit and interacting is a way that I cope.  I feel like I'm on an upward spiral for now, so it's all good.  

With me, it's that I feel *nothing*.  I lose my ability to do anything that I normally love to do, and all I want to do is sleep and just sit in a dark room feeling nothing but wondering what it would feel like to bleed to death in a bathtub (I'm not suicidal, but I think about death a lot).  My motor functions even slow down, and problem solving at work becomes quite a chore.  Then, when it becomes overwhelming, I just sit and cry like a wild woman.  I'm not crying because I'm sad... it's just the only way I can feel anything of any kind.  

Whatever you do, DO NOT say things like ""Why not just choose to be happy?"" or ""You're so wonderful!  What do you have to feel sad about?""  People with depression can't just cheer up and choose to feel happy.  Just be there for her.  "
"I had it in late teens. Attempted suicide, wrist-cutting etc.  it's empty. You're empty. A void, an abyss inside of you that nothing can fill. So numb that your mother can be hugging you, crying, asking where her baby went, her little bright sunshine of a boy, and you stare over her shoulder, glassy-eyed and empty, simply waiting for her to let go so you can go back upstairs and continue to be empty.
You.just.want.to.die.  You build a wall, an immovable object, around yourself. No emotions in, no emotions out.  No one cares about you or understands how you feel, even if they say they care.  You have no motivation, no interest, no happiness, no reason to get up in the morning. Every day is empty or full of despair.

Depending on how bad off she is, you may not be able to reach her no matter how hard you try.  But try. Please try. Try as hard as you possibly can."
"Nothingness and then there are the gaps.  It's like I black out or something.  I was just looking at my bathroom and I had never thrown away new boxes for the soap.  I just let them stack up in the bathroom.  I didn't even notice them when I was experiencing a depressive episode  and I would never do that if I was feeling healthy. I could be in a burning house and not even notice when I'm depressed. I have gaps like that a lot.  I just wake up one day and realize that I've just let life roll by without even interacting with it.  Often it feels like there is a piece of dirty glass between me and life.  I can kind of see, hear, smell, but not really; there's a filter on life.  I know I don't make any sense. It sucks. "
"I have Manic Depression and in my experience, it's extremely debilitating. Normally, I am pretty cool about everything and get things done even if I'm having a bad day. Normal feelings are easy to work through. Fighting with friends? Ehh I'll sleep on it, I have things to do. But then the depression is triggered by something (or at times, seemingly nothing) and it's EXACTLY like a physical ailment. I get something similar to nausea, except I can't throw up. Food is disgusting, I can't eat. I have a hard time swallowing because my throat begins closing up. Someone walks up to me and cheerily asks me ""Hey, how are you?"" and all I can do is stare blankly because what answer could I possibly give. The world is spiraling downwards and there is nothing I can do. It's like people are looking at you through a window. They just don't understand. They'll never understand. They are trying to get you to go bowling when you feel so awful, even though you fear death just as much as everyone else, you wish you weren't alive. It is 100% a disease. I've suffered chronic migraines my entire life, dislocated my knee, and used to be a drug addict and was beaten up/jumped multiple times. I have felt pain and I would choose anything physical over depression. 
     As her SO, please try to understand that you cannot cure her depression. It exists outside of you. You will never find the kernel that causes it, no matter how much you try. The best/only thing you can do is let her know that you will love her and be there when she's at her worst. She needs to know that there is light in the dark. Imagine she is in jail. She can't get out, and bad things are happening inside. She has nothing to offer you and it makes her feel even more awful that her incarceration effects you negatively. Keep visiting her, even when she says not to. Keep calling her. Keep writing her letters. Someday she'll be free and you two can embrace, but until then, let her know you love her for who she is, and not what she does for you. It's true for anyone going through it. People need to know they don't have to be happy and perfect for you to love them. "
"I had chronic depression from 13 or so until I was 22. Once I was far more sorted and looking back on it all, the thing that struck me was how mundane it all is at the time. I knew a lot of it wasn't good, but it was just my life. Even when I stared into a snowstorm and thought about laying down in it to kill myself, it didn't seem weird. I didn't even think of it as contemplating suicide until someone asked me if I'd had suicidal thoughts.

Others have said this already, but professional help is a big step in the right direction. Especially if you can find someone who's great for you. I went to five different therapists until I found the right one. I've always had people who cared about me deeply, and were there for me. I know that having their love and support helped greatly because I didn't have to go through it alone, but seeing a therapist was one of the best things I ever did for myself. 

This is something that will never go away entirely. There will always be moments when she falls into the same patterns or thinks the same way. The best you can do is help her live and think in a way that minimizes the impact on her life, but she has to do the brunt of the work herself. Good luck, and godspeed."
"It's hard to get out of bed, that's a cliché but it's true. You feel debilitated, as in physically debilitated. It's like your mind is so grey and blunt and in your mind vision you just see a pitch of black. 
I have every reason to be depressed right now but thank god I have learned that exercise fights depression hard, so I exercise every day and it works.

"After middle school all my friends left the school. Starting high school was a huge change for me and I felt really alone. To top it off I had diagnosed disgraphia, ADD, as well as mild case Aspergers syndrome. Basically I broke down. I couldn't go to school I was crying practically everyday, it felt as physically debilitating as it was mental, there were times when I quite literally could not move. Eventually with the right medication and a fantastic psychiatrist I was able to recover. Depression is tough. I hope your SO can pull through it. "
"It's a mixture of fear, panic, hatred of others, and self-loathing. The tiniest little thing can set you spiraling into one of these categories.

My girlfriend and I recently got out of this funk after 3 months. All I could do was be as supportive and as positive as possible towards her. *She* has to want to get better as well. 

Be encouraging if she wants to do something. Thank her for things. Ask her for small favors. Don't be negative or sad back to her. Sadness is infectious just like happiness is.

"
"It's honestly hard to put into words. It didn't happen all at once and was kind of a downward spiral into nothing. It starts out as sadness and just goes on to become a constant nothing. It's hard to feel anything but hatred towards yourself. At my worst my grandfather had died and I just didn't feel anything although we were extremely close. As far as suicidal thoughts go you I never thought I would even consider. As the days went on I started weighing the pros and cons of it. I still didn't really want to die, but it just became an option. After a while I had considered it heavily and was on the verge of ending my life so I decided to see a psychiatrist. Things are better now, but they're still hard sometimes. To anyone going through depression of any form, get help immediately from a professional. It's not something that gets better on it's own."

"I had what was diagnosed as a Major Depressive Episode when my sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer. With the family going through a lot anyway, the only person who knew was my SO. Each day I would fake being normal and trying to support my family, and each night I would be so exhausted at the effort of it all I would just pass out. A few months after she died I was made redundant from my job and I pretty much had a breakdown as it all hit me at once. I lost the ability and energy to fake being normal anymore. I just couldn't cope. I still didn't tell my family though, as they were trying to deal with their grief. 

It's a few years on and I'm still struggling, although I can at least fake it now. It still exhausts me and every so often I just cannot get out of bed, and I phone into work with a stomach bug or migraine as I wouldn't trust them to understand a mental illness. It helps really that I HAVE to get up on most days, there is no choice, so I get up and pretend. I think those that I work with would be surprised if they knew. 

I'm not suicidal, but I'd be pretty pleased not to exist and go through this day after day. "
"Im not sure if mine is severe but its getting up in the morning and hating everything, begin driving to school and just pulling over and sitting there for 30 minutes before turning around and going back to bed."
"If I quit taking my Prozac, I become suicidal in about 48 hours.  By ""suicidal"" I mean I start thinking about how to commit suicide.  I realize what is happening, i.e., that I do not actually want to die, but I cannot voluntarily stop thinking about suicide and why I am worthless.  From time to time my pharmacy changes the brand of generic Prozac that it dispenses; some of them do not work.  How do I know?  I start thinking about suicide.  The common notion that a depressed person can choose not to be depressed is completely mistaken, and in a relationship situation it is toxic.  Depression is a biochemically-caused condition, and the victim can no more cure himself by will power alone than can a person who has a disease such as cancer or pneumonia."
I go through varying waves of depression every so often. If I'm just feeling down i drink a little too much a little to often and try to numb myself up to the world. If it gets really bad then I'll come home from work and get into bed and go to sleep because being awake and conscious seems like too much of a burden. I end up becoming a shut in for a couple weeks. Just work and sleep and work and sleep. 
"The best way I can describe it is like constantly wearing a very, very heavy coat with a mind of its own. 

Think about it. Think about depression like a very heavy coat, and its only objective is to bring you down to the ground. You don't know how it got on you in the first place. You don't know why it feels so heavy. You don't even realize at first it's there. But it's *heavy as hell*. It confines your movements. It weighs down on your shoulders. You know you can unbutton it, remove it, you know it's not right for you to wear the coat all the time, but it's so damn heavy that the effort to raise your hand and unbutton it is incredible. 

The coat only lets you move as far as it wants to let you move, and the collar is up so high that you hear and see only what it wants you to see and hear. 

And most people don't understand it. They can ask you, ""Have you tried taking it off?"" ""Can you not wear the coat?"" ""You're not accomplishing anything while in this coat!"" - they wouldn't know, unless they wore it for themselves. 

Eventually your body adapts to the coat, to its weight, to its confinement, and whatever you know or remember of life without the coat retreats into the back of your mind. Getting up is an effort, but it's a familiar effort. You know that the coat is on you. You know that it's possible to remove it, but either the weight of the coat sapped your strength, or you just adapt and accept it as par for the course. 

That's what the coat wants. And it can get heavier, confining you even more, and obscuring your vision until you just can't see past the coat collar. And you know, at that moment, that it can bring you to where you won't be able to get up again.

But when you do muster the power to unbutton even one button on that coat, removing it becomes easier. When you finally battle through removing it, you fling it into a corner, but it never goes away. It's always there, in a pile. You may forget about its presence, but your body remembers its weight, its confinement; your mind always remembers not being able to see past it. And you always keep wondering if one day you'll find it on you again. 

 
From personal experience with the coat, as I put it, I felt...numb. Most of the time, it's not so much as what I felt, as what I didn't. I would get so frustrated with the fact that apart from just an empty blank space, I didn't really feel very much. It took a long time to fight through, and an even longer time to feel happy in any iteration. 

The best thing you can do is be there for her. Hug her and tell her it's okay. If she wants to be in bed for a day, that is fine - stay by her. Listen to her when she talks to you about what she feels. Professional help is very important, but what's also important is support from the people closest to her - and that makes a huge difference in pulling through it."
"For me, I would go to bed wishing my heart would stop, and wake up disappointed to still be alive. Every single morning I would think ""how the hell am I going to talk to people, smile at people, pretend to be okay?"" Life was exhausting.

One way I tried to describe it to someone once: it's like your mind is an open field, and you're standing there, and all of a sudden you can feel the rain coming. There's this black cloud building up in your head and you try to stop it, because it's your mind, right? You should be able to stop things from happening in your brain if you want to, right?. But you can't - that cloud builds up and builds up no matter how hard you fight, and eventually it bursts into a storm, and once the storm starts you're just useless for a while. It literally did feel like a storm in my head - like a tornado, really. The inside of my mind was all dark and thoughts were spinning around at 150 mph and I had no control over it. It was scary as fuck and exhausting and that's really why I was suicidal - being inside my brain sucked so bad I didn't want to keep going anymore."
For me it is having daily thoughts of hanging myself but knowing that would hurt my SO too much to actually complete suicide. It also means seeing a psychiatrist for over a year but still searching for the right meds (they are now adding a low dose of abilify to my wellbutrin and trintellix.  It also means feeling like a failure because my job is being a youth and family therapist and I can't even get through my own depression. It's been 2 years now and I am just so tired of this shit.
"In my case it was awful. It cropped up twice. The first instance was a year and a half of fatigue, emptiness, and feeling absolutely useless. The second was just a month ago and I've only recently felt better (if you don't count any of this week). I screwed up though, I didn't let my SO know and now he's pulling away. My advice? Let her know you're there. You can never truly understand how she feels, but you can be there for her. It's dark, empty, and draining; however having someone there for me was comforting. Does she laugh when you make a fart noise? Make the damn fart noise. Laughing is light, you forget (even if just for a second) that you're down. When you sleep, hold her tight. Make sure she knows you won't let go. She will pull through, just say strong."
"I've had it my whole life (hereditary). I mean, it sucks but once you've found the right medication regimen --- and yes, trial and error can be a part of it --- it's not so bad. 

On top of everything else I lost my job and have been out of work, which has added more specific depression. However, in addition to my medication my ailment has also given me years of therapy which has equipped me to deal with it in a healthy manner.

**tl;dr** It sucks, but finding the right medication and therapy regimen can help you cope not only with the disorder, but also with other things that may go wrong in your life.



**EDIT**: Oh, but to answer your question, there's a sense of emptiness and boredom. Like, ""So I get up tomorrow and do shit and then go back to bed. And then I have to get up and do the same thing, day after day for the rest of my life? Am I just waiting out the clock?"". "
I read several of the comments regarding a lack of interest or meaning in life.  All of this is true.  Consider a life where everything is gray and there is nothing colorful.  your favorite food is ash in your mouth.  There's a bleak hopelessness that's pervasive in everything you do.  You're lonely even when around your closest friends.  Don't mistake it for sadness.  I can still chuckle at something humorous.  
"It's when you are sad every single second, without perspective and intrusive thoughts.

It will drain your life day by day, every new one will be worse if you let that happen. 

She needs professional help and build some self esteem, discipline and healthy habits. 

ps: Exercise helps alot, you should support her, it is a hell if you feel no one is supporting you. "
"Someone can be saying irrelevant things like ""Hi, how's your day?"" and you feel tears coming and you wonder why you stepped out of the house.
You dislike people and get them to stay away because you don't want people to see you.
Everything's wrong and jumping out seems not really that scary.

There's really nothing you can do. Hug her maybe. Nothing much else."
"Had a 2ish year phase where I was really bad, I worked as a bartender, loved my job/co workers, but little did they know that unless I was working, I was home playing WoW like a religion, drinking all the time..good days it was just beer, bad days I'd be killing bottles of jack or whatever I was having at the time.

Feeling lonely, worthless, crying myself to sleep on a nightly basis, a big reason was I fucked up a good long term relationship and didn't realize the gravity of my mistake til I moved to the other side of the country a couple months later.

3 suicide attempts..almost made it on my 3rd..russian roulette with a bunch of random pills and woke up in the E.R a few hours later.

I can go on but I'm not about to write a detailed novel."

"Show her that you care. Depression can affect each person in different ways but it makes one feel very lonely and worthless. You feel detached from the world , hence the feeling ""everything would be better of without me"" which is very common for everyone who suffers from it. 
As some people have said above, if she's in a very deep depressive state then you probably won't be able to offer much help, but be there. Show her that she's not alone , she's not a failure , that she's important for you . 
It's a very personal problem so in the end of the day she will have to be the one to deal with it on her own - but it's a lonely road so if you can just be there to make her feel loved and cared for then it might make things better. "
"Honestly, depending on what she is going through, there may not BE a ""pull through"". Up front I have to say, if it is real depression (major or minor) she should seek professional help.

With that out of the way, I can say a few things that you should know. First, let her know in clear and certain terms that you are there for her and can help her, and listen to her. A lot of stress can be relieved just by having someone to talk to, to share an emotional burden or feelings or other shit. 
Second, depending on whether this is a life-long thing or a brief episode, cognitive behavioral therapy helps, and is something you can do without a professional (though it helps to have a therapist). This means, if there are certain ways of thinking or thoughts that she has that are detrimental/defeatist/depressing, she acknowledges them when they happen, and mentally refutes them. It is a bit more in depth than that, but look it up, it can change a person's thinking.
Third, TELL HER TO SEEK THERAPY. There is no shame in going to a doctor when you are sick, and there shouldn't be any when going to a therapist for mental illness. Having a detached third party to talk about your problems with is very beneficial, even if she will talk to you about her problems. Another advantage is that it makes it that much easier to get a prescription if it is deemed necessary, or something that she wants to try.
Fourth, push her to do things. With depression, it becomes very easy to close yourself off and not want to do things, even things you would normally want to do, and sometimes she will need to be dragged into doing things. Going out, being social, doing fun activities, these can all help with depression, BUT, it can be difficult to discern when a push is needed or when it should not be attempted, and could actually be counter-productive.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a doctor or licensed therapist, I just know about my own situation and what helped me, from living my entire life with dysthimia, and having a two year period of major depressive disorder, and am now on medication and going to therapy, managing my mental health. "
"IMO, you can't TRULY understand it unless you experience it firsthand.  But I'll try to explain.

You feel surrounded by grey, by bleakness, a despair that almost has weight.  The world seems to love kicking you down; things are always going wrong.  You feel like the scum of the earth, no matter how many times people tell you you're wonderful.  You can only focus on all the bad things that have happened in your life, on the mistakes you've made.  You begin to see yourself as a burden, a shame to society, and you believe the world would be better off without you. Some days, you feel catatonic, and you aren't sure you're even alive anymore.  You have lost all hope and believe you're doomed to be unhappy and alienated forever.

But there IS hope.  Today, I am happy, smiling, looking towards the future.  I still feel really bitter about things sometimes, but I've let go of a lot of things I'd thought would fester inside me forever.  I believe your SO can recover.  Sometimes, depressed or not, we feel like we've sunk so deep into despair there is no way out.  But there is ALWAYS hope."
"Finding an answer is the best thing you can do. Through all the meaningless chaos and apathy in the world, the only respite a person can get is finding an answer that fits them. Allowing yourself to let out emotions can be a way....

Honestly, many people are digging themselves a deeper hole in the split moment where you want to commit suicide. Best thing to do is to tell your SO to sleep on it. Depression can come with stress or lack of sleep as well.

The saddest song I've heard.....

">  I question sometimes (rationally) the point in living.

I feel this. My only real family is my parents, and really only my mom. I have no siblings. I'm nearly 34 and have no real expectation of ever having a girlfriend or wife. Kids are even more laughable. 

I have no interest in going back to school, I have a dead end job, a house and two dogs. The dogs are really the reason I keep going. "
"its a sad reality, but life sucks, it fucks you sideways, and then you die and none of it really ever mattered. you live to die basically, its sucks that this is what civilization has come to"
Your experience is similar to mine. I think the most interesting thing about it (for me- I cant say this applies to you or anyone else of course) is that when I'm okay I still know that life is ultimately 'pointless' but it just doesn't bother me. Its interesting how the objective facts don't change but the way we feel about them does.
"This description actually sounds like Major Depressive Disorder. 

Manic depression, which you mention in your post is something different. 

You may want to consider therapy and/or pharmacological treatments."
It doesn't matter that nothing matters. You don't need to change the world to live a meaningful life. 
"I feel like you are also being reinforced by the mild high you can get from starving yourself.  At least that's how I feel.  Soon after I eat, I get the energy to 'think' and in turn have a multitude of negative thoughts. "

"When I stopped taking my medication I tried eating food, but my mouth was completely dry. It's almost as if my body didn't want me to eat, or do anything.. When you're depressed you lose the will to do anything."

holy shit. thank you for sharing this video. it hits hard
"Oh my god, I can't believe how dead-on that *cartoon* was! Seriously word for word, everything that was stated/illustrated... I couldn't have said it better myself. I'm so glad you shared that."
"Im sorry you had to go through that. I don't know your case or your ex boyfriend, but I was somebody who dumped their girlfriend in the middle of her depression. For a long time I felt bad, I felt selfish. But I thought about it one day. For a year and a half I tried it all to fix her because she wasn't trying to fix herself. I tried being positive and giving her what she wanted, I tried forcing her out of bed and to school, I cried, I got angry, I screamed, I called doctors, I cried more and tried her to get into a mentally and physically healthier lifestyle. I even started to write her a book about how to deal with it, and how I felt - although I had no idea how to deal with it myself. One day I finally had enough, I broke it off with her for good (after many fights and semi break ups). I felt my happiness had dissappearred and I wasn't who I was anymore. Sometimes that's just the way people have to deal with things. "
Good for you the way people treated you after you were hospitalized was fucked up but I'm glad you made it through.
"I remember the real darkest depths of what I had, how actively horrible it was.

But what I have now, that chronic, moderate depression, is just as insidious. It's just like what you say. Maybe I don't wanna die, but life is just so hard, even if objectively it's not. You just deal and deal and deal, draining you away,  but you remember, maybe, at some point that it never used to be so hard just to live. That there's another feeling out there, one that actually feels good, that you used to feel more often than once a couple of months.

Onward to therapy and meds and the acknowledgement of hope that, even if I don't feel it in my heart, that I know it can be done."
I know bro stay strong ;) 
That quote is one of the best succinct descriptions I've seen so far; nice.
"It's the feeling (kind of true). That the entire fabric of our society and culture and social norms are built to the advantage of people who AREN'T depressed.  The world rewards outgoing, motivated, confident, driven,  emotionally in-control people.

It's horrible to basically have just been stuck with faulty wiring that basically makes you the OPPOSITE of what's required to mesh with the world, and it absolutely feels like a cosmic joke."
"You are so strong to have made it, even if it continues to be hard. 

I know that may sound hollow over the internet, maybe won't mean anything to you, but I'm someone who has suffered from depression and by nature of my particular illness will continue to do so periodically for the rest of my life. I mean it as more than an empty platitude.

Wishing the best to you and to all of us in this thread."

"Its more that supportive people must not take it as a fault of their selves if you have depression.  And this kind of narcissism is dangerous to friendship and life - it will ruin relationships and increase the volatility of the one suffering.  

you need to remember they are experiencing depression every second of their lives - in physical, emotional, and mental anguish.  They feel their past, present, and future are hopeless to a great extent.  

It is wonderful that you are compassionate and empathic enough to want to help.  that is very rare.  But you must remember this is not about you, it is about the individual who believes they are broken and not compatible with their life.  Things will be said with generalization and imperfect wording, do not try to hold them to this or use the ""But I didn't do that, did I,"" deflection because that just NULLIFIES their feelings and thoughts.  This nullification of their mental process is a defacto nullification of their entire selves.  And that is dangerous.  You are telling a depressed person that their thoughts and feelings are invalid and wrong.  if they are in a dangerous place, they may just snap."
"Try a little bit of everything until you find something that is worth your while.  I for instance feel good chopping wood....or creating things.  No, I'm never going to be that person ecstatic about anything or loving my life but they're small victories.  Animals, gardening, woodworking, any form of creating....all pretty satisfying in my experience."
"Yeah, one thing that stuck with me was in a Ken Burns film about Lewis & Clark, where Meriwether Lewis on his birthday was all depressed and questioning if he had done enough to change the world.  He was younger than I am now.  Pretty sure he shot himself...."
"That just means that its common to feel this way, not that anyone/everyone who shares this feeling will be able to make a change."
"On a large enough scale, *nothing* matters. You could annihilate the entire planet, and sure, it would suck for the planet, but the galaxy wouldn't even notice. But that doesn't mean that nothing matters at all. It all does matter, at smaller scales. And that's okay. It means it's actually more important to do what matters to you, rather than worry about doing something that matters to the world. If you derive satisfaction from doing something with wider impact, by all means, shoot for that, but don't feel like your life is pointless just because it might not change the whole world; no matter what, it does change your own bit of the world."
"Mmm.  There are times where I won't sleep for days, because my brain won't stop tearing itself apart until there literally isn't enough energy left for it to remain operational."

"I can understand where you're coming from. In regards to my ex-boyfriend, he was my world and he knew it. We'd been together for about four years and he knew I had issues with depression, but I was pretty persistent to not dump my issues on him. I relied on him at first (when our relationship was young) but after, as you describe, fights and semi-breakups I realised what stress I was putting on him, particularly because his brother was fighting cancer. I really closed up emotionally to try and make his life easier. 

I have no hard feelings against him, just like I understand why you ended things, I can understand why he ended things. However, the way he did it was poor. He visited the hospital every day and night for the first few days and then one day he didn't turn up. Instead, my best friend turned up and explained that he wasn't coming because he wanted to breakup. Honestly, I have never felt so heartbroken. 

It was a good life lesson though and time is a great healer. He's in a relationship with another girl and is happy. I'm married and happy. I know he regrets what he did though, I can see it in his eyes whenever we bump into each other, however, I'm glad I saw his true colours before we got even more serious; as blunt as this sounds, I dodged a bullet."
Love you.
Same here! It really makes me feel. Glad you liked it. 
"That’s it exactly, its wiring.  Or chemistry.  I see absolutely no difference between depression and, say, diabetes.   It’s chemistry.

Yes it means that they can take you into custody for fear that you are a danger to yourself or others.

"if one is suicidal or even in the neighborhood they should go and see professional help assuredly.  I was dealing with counselors and pharmacologists who were obsessed with 1-10 rankings, pills, and convincing me that my concerns were not really that troubling.   That it was all through my employer's health and employee care programs did not help.  And yes, that company did lay me off as soon as they could shuffle my body around enough to do it legally."
"Sorry, I wrote to a generic reader who is trying to support someone who is suffering.  I deal every minute of every day with my specters as well, I didn't mean to cause trouble.  

I just wanted to help those that want to help understand something. As depression is such a personal and varied affliction I tried to relate in as generalized a manner as possible.  you know, to take the ego out of it.   

I know I have lost people and relationships because they took my depression personally.  It seemed they got angry with me that they were not the miracle worker.  And then I felt guilt for making them angry. And that really angered me (with my self and the other) and set me further back from society.  Further from even wanting to want to be in society.  

I just build what I can myself, within or around myself.  Do a little thing every day that makes my immediate world better.  just a walk, clean something for a minute (even if its just putting crap in boxes), etc.  - then letting it make me feel less bad when I see it next. Then let it snowball the next day.  "
"I do have plans.  I just realize that in a few hundred years, my life won't matter no matter how much I try to be great.  Unless of course you consider the butterfly effect.....we all influence one another, and we change the future.  How though?  And will my stepping on a butterfly negate the extinction of a species....or will the greedy assholes in power just nuke us all?  I call it being a realist."

"I don't have major depression....I think it's more like chronic depression.  Nothing's fun.  Nothing's worth doing.  I think if I were to win the lottery I'd just breathe a sigh of relief and be glad that bullshit is over with.  Wouldn't make me happy though.  I question sometimes (rationally) the point in living.  I mean, sure, to have children and make an impact on the world is probably the best reasons for living, but is that going to actually matter?  This shithole is already overpopulated and there's not much one person can change.  

I'm not suicidal, I have plans, but I don't think they'll have any profound effect.  I could lie on train tracks and it wouldn't make a difference in the grand scheme of things.  I could continue living and maybe enjoy decimating this planet some more.  I mean, I'm just one person, but I contribute to everything.  For good or for bad, I'm not really going to leave a mark.  My life doesn't matter, that's truth.

Now, *I think* the difference between major depression and chronic depression is that I live with this reality, whereas for a manic depressive all of these feelings hit them like a ton of bricks.  It's different for everyone, but mine is a long-lasting, mild type.  I can at least get out of bed to eat some eggs and cheese, even if I do feel it's pointless."

This video was spot on for me. 

Also, never underestimate the power of just being there for your SO.  Ask them what is helpful; do they want you to sit with them in bed? To force them to take a shower? To reassure them that you love them? 

And to echo the others, professional help.  Preferably with a well-regarded therapist (I prefer ones who specialize in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and possibly also a psychiatrist for medication. "

"I suffered with major depression (with psychotic tendencies) in my late teens, which led to an attempted suicide. 

It's really hard to explain but I just felt like my life was pointless, that the people around me would be better off if I were dead and that I was just a burden on my ex-boyfriend, friends and family. There were days when I wouldn't get out of bed, not even to shower. I locked myself away from everybody and convinced myself they didn't care anyway. I failed school, I had no libido, I dropped about 45 pounds (I was about 140 pounds before my depression), I couldn't watch tv because it bored me, I couldn't eat, I was constantly dehydrated and I was in complete denial. Whenever anybody would ask how I was doing, I would smile and say 'yeah, really good'. I just didn't want to bother people. 
I was also very risk-taking. I would get stupid drunk or drugged-up and get myself into dangerous situations. This led to the overdose. I decided one evening that it would be a good idea to drink myself to death and take about 180 pills (a mixture of codeine, paracetamol, caffeine pills, allergy meds, ephedrine.. you name it). The night was a blurr, I didn't pass out.. a friend was around and he drove me home. Thankfully I'd started vomiting by that time. 

In the morning, I couldn't keep anything down. Not even water. I couldn't urinate. I felt sick. My whole abdomen felt searing. It was in that moment I realised I didn't want to die. I got my grandfather to take me to A&E where I admitted to what I had done and was put on a drip for a week due to my liver failing. 

I lost the trust of my family, my friends and my ex-boyfriend dumped me on my hospital bed. After I recovered, I was still very messed up, quite traumatised. I was over 18 when I overdosed and in the UK that means that they don't need to support you. I was literally given a leaflet and told to go home. I could have easily attempted suicide again, but a little voice in my head told me to change. 

Without medications or therapy, I managed to recover on my own. It took a long time (about two years) but it was worth it. I just travelled alot, made time for myself, started to care for myself, read alot and admitted my problems.

Today I am 22 yo, studying Psychology, married, living away and my depression is classified as mild (sometimes it gets worse but I can talk myself out of it). Turns out there is a light at the end of a tunnel :)


"
"It's weight. It sits on your chest. Depression throws the anchor over board. Interests in every aspect of life dissipate, even hunger. It all becomes very stagnant and murky. The word that comes to mind is hopelessness, but even that implies that there is an internal resolve that will cater to the pulling of yourself out of that depth. To find hope. Major depression does not acknowledge that resolve.

I'd suggest having your SO seek professional help. Talk to someone who has an outside of the box perspective. Get the most suitable medication and therapy available.



"
"Had a short (a few months) bout a while back, wasn't a major case I think.

It didn't even hurt, it's just your new normal. When you're well, you don't really remember what having the cold is like. You know it abstractly but you can't really recall what *being* sick is like.

It's like that, everything around you is just the way it is. You can't really understand feeling better because it doesn't make sense, you hurt and that is the way it is. You just want to not bother anyone and stay out of the way, you're only ever a burden. You don't want to kill yourself, but living is just to much work. It's easier to just lay down and stay out of the way.

You eat because you know you have to, and you go through the motions of other tasks, but things fail to come together."
"It's not that I are or were sad, but I am in a melancholic state of mind. I lacked motivation to do anything exciting, like getting up and smell coffee in the morning  or go out and excercise. I also suffer from sleep deprivation as a result of the depression. 

It is really hard to give any advice on how to help her pull through, because every case of depression or major depression has different symptoms and how it affect a person. Proffesional help is maybe a solution. For me it worked to speak with my personal doctor, he helped me get medications to fight sleep deprivation and gave me advice on how to push new boundaries to help motivate myself. I wasn't even aware that I had a depression until he told me that I was on a crash course, and that was 8 years after I first experienced the symptoms. 

Be careful on how you approach this with your SO, it can be a very personal and a very touchy area. That is probably the best advice I can give you on the matter."
"I have disthymia. 

Nothing motivates me. Nothing interests me. I struggle to get up because I feel tired all the time, and then when I can't I'm disgusted with myself. I feel so useless and pointless."
"It's hard to explain. 

I would isolate myself whenever I got depressed. And it would last so long. I had depression end of middle school and my whole high school years. Sometimes I wouldn't even know the reason why I am so upset. My ex would always ask me what's wrong and I would shrug cause I don't know. A wave would hit me. I lost motivation to do things I loved to do. I couldn't sleep well. 

Then it would get to the point where I was just numb. I wouldn't eat for days. My stomach would scream for food but I wouldn't feel hunger. I didn't give a shit about anything. Didn't talk to my parents, and stayed in my room. It was hard to picture why I am still alive when everyday was the same, wake up and feeling nothing. But I was also to scared to let myself be happy, once I notice I was happy, I would get depressed. I don't know how I would comfort my SO if they were in my position. But my ex helped me get through depression by just being there. He used to be depressed and used to harm himself like me. He also helped with my eating disorder.

I was so good at hiding it though, because that is how people saw me. People knew me as the girl who smiled all the time and laughed at the littlest things."

"My depression is almost like a living thing, it wants to survive, and thrive. It will try and trick me into believing that things will never get better, or that even if they do I won't be happy. It will tell me that the good things in life aren't that good and that everything is meaningless. It will build walls around me and keep me from seeing anything outside of my depression. It tells me I'm worthless. It tells me I'm stupid. It tells me to stay in bed. It tells me I'll be better off dead. 

I still get up every day and go to work. I do it because at some point in my late 20s I realized that this wasn't something everyone goes through. It wasn't ennui, or angst, and I did deserve better. 

I can tell you right now, there is no chance in any way, shape, or form that you can ""pull your SO out of this. They need professional help. They will only get better when they want to take those steps to get better. You can suggest they get that help but by no means can you save them, or force them into getting it. Just be supportive, and understanding and patient. 

TL:DR, suggest your SO seek out professional help, be supportive, and remember that they can't change until they choose to."
"I hate it, Then I hate myself, but I love it...... because it makes me feel alive...,but I hate it."
"I can't even remember where I found this, or who to credit it to, but I seen this piece of text somewhere that just made me feel something in my chest when I read it. It describes perfectly to me how I've felt. 


""You asked me how depression felt, and this is all I could come up with. 


It feels like
I'm walking upstream
through a current strong enough
to pull me under four times over. 


There are others with me,
but they are walking along the banks
telling me to ""Just get out of the water.""
But instead of extending a hand in help,
they just move on and leave me behind. 


Every once in a while I find a rock
that is strong enough for me to lean on,
and I can rest for a bit. 


But the rocks always get tired of holding me up,
and when they let go I'm left drowning -thrown 50ft back again. 


And nothing is harder
than standing up in that current,
when everything in you
is telling you how much easier everything would be, 
if you just let yourself get dragged under."""
"I'll address the experience of trying to talk to my friends about it, since plenty others have commented on the experience itself.

First and foremost:  

You don't know what it's like.  That's not an attack or an accusation, it's something you have to remember.  Depression isn't like that time you were super bummed or stressed out,  and you really can't just will it away.

The thing that bother me most when I reach out to non-depressed loved ones is that they never really 'get it',  but they always think they do, mainly because it's a difficult experience to convey, especially when the terminology is also commonly used to explain more transitory experiences that everyone experiences.  You have to remind yourself that just because it's SOUNDS like something you've experienced, it isn't.  

The easiest way I can explain this is:  if you are about to say something starting with ""you just have to..."",  you've got it wrong.

A person with depression can't ""just"" anything when it comes to dealing with depression.  They can't ""just let it go"" they can't ""just tell yourself X"".

Also, please please please don't fall into the trap of telling them things they should ""be happy about"".  They know.  Depression isn't a lack of perspective,  and these statements usually just make them feel worse, like ""You don't have the right to be depressed"".

Every case it a little different, though, and this may not apply to everyone,  but the basic idea that you need to understand is that no matter how similar something they're describing sounds to something you've experienced, the 'solution' is not going to be the same, especially if the 'solution' is just to 'buck up' or somehow WILL the depression away.  It doesn't work like that."
"I have a really extensive history of it but I don't want to overshare, so I won't go for anything too intense. Something that really sucks about the big depressive periods for me though, the ones that last for very long amounts of time, is that while talking your issues through with someone can feel amazing, like taking a huge weight off your shoulders, you also get this awful crushing guilt from it. 

You get some temporary relief from your shit, after keeping it bottled up for so long, and then it comes back to haunt you. No matter what you say to that person from then on, you feel like a huge burden and always feel like you're just an annoyance in their life for putting your problems onto them.

You're a good person for trying to be there and help your SO, for sure. I hope that they can get the help they need and pull through."
"Mine is more of a mind-set that God hates me, or is punishing me.  Not just passively ignoring, but actively out to hurt me.   The man I love choose someone else; I don’t get to have that life I wanted, I don’t get to be happy, Gods doing.   Why should I bother trying to do anything if God is not going to let me have it.   I mean seriously, if God doesn’t care, what’s the damn point?  That is my mind set right now.    And in case anyone’s wondering, yes, I started therapy last week.  "
"On point with those that said seeking professional help, if she hasn't already. I dealt with a relentlessly deep depression for over 15 years before I finally mustered up the courage to tell someone (my mom) that I truly felt like I couldn't hang on anymore - like I was dead but physically alive. I didn't see a meaning in living, and living day to day was work. I wanted to just end my ""life"" for years but didn't know how. (Side note: In a way I still have this feeling today - I really don't see a point in life and every day is just sort of like, ""Okay... I'm here... ugh."" and if I died today it would be a relief and I wouldn't regret it. The difference is the depression feelings just aren't there anymore.) The best way to describe the actual feeling of the depression is to picture a clothesline running through the inside of your chest; then picture one of those giant, 1000 lb. anvils like in the roadrunner cartoons hanging from it down through the center of you. It feels like your insides weigh a million pounds and could cave in at any moment. Any time I was in a situation where I was supposed to be happy, I had to fake it. I tried so hard to find some enjoyment in good times, but I just couldn't. When I was younger I would stay home from school and just cry and cry for no particular reason all day long. Depression does run in my family, but it was also a result of situations I was experiencing in life as well. Anyway, I finally went to a psychiatrist and was officially diagnosed with the depression and a mood disorder (which we had already suspected). I'm not big on taking medication at all, but decided to try one out for just the mood disorder and see if that helped the depression at all. Luckily it did. After a few months on the medication, it felt like that anvil wasn't there anymore and that my ""normal"" mood was at an even keel rather than under rock bottom and 50 feet of sh*t. Depression can feel different for everyone, but there's always the underlying theme of complete despair and misery. It's really great that you're asking first-hand experience to try to get an idea of what your special someone is going through - props to you for really caring and actually wanting to help."
"I like to think of myself as a problem solver, and the biggest problem in my life is me. Very hard to justify the immense drain I am on the world around me, feel guilty for burdening everybody. Just want to hide, just want to go away."

Sleeping is an issue with my depression it gets to a point where i over think things that i said or did years ago. And end up not sleeping for a day and a half or so and just pass out from exhaustion. And then there's days where getting out of bed is just to much.
"Well the only thing u can do is be there for her and try to make her forget the world ... Forget the problems .. Thats the best .. However sadly somtimes with as much professional health and as much love as there ultimately u have to pull trough by yourself , u have to find things to are worth living for , and u have to convince yourself that things will get better in the future , cause thats the tricks about depressions, they trick u into believing that things will always stay the same , that u will never get happy , that u are one of the chosens to be unhappy . And ultimately its this that traps u there  , until when u realize it isnt all about happiness but about having a path worth living , a path of your own .until are at peace with yourself u will be traped there .. All u can do is just in my opinion is just be there for her make her forget,  do stuff ,  make her arrive late at night in bed so that  shes tired ... Cause thats many time in those moments when u are talking by yourself that the real agony is . The forgetting fells so good , makes u feel alive . But each case is a case , and to each person and problem there may be a diferrent way to pull trough .and medicine  dont cure , they are like band aids to the problem but they let u have a emotional stability to maybe help u pull trough  
Sorry not native speaker sorry for any mistakes "
"You can't just pull someone through depression. that's not how it works. It's a chemical imbalance in their brain that causes them to irrationally feel sad and depressed. This misconception is one of the most damaging to people suffering with the condition.

I have suffered with what I consider mild depression for years. I go untreated because frankly the antidepressants seem very risky to me, but it is still an enormous pain in the ass.

You wake up in the morning and don't see any reason to get out of bed. Who cares if you're late to work/school? nobody would miss you if you didn't show up. You have to will yourself up because you know it's not true and people would be pissed if you didn't show etc...

It's really hard to have solid relationships because you feel sad all the time about stupid things like your appearance not being perfect or if you say something dumb or you'll think people hate you because they didn't return a call immediately or other stupid crap that is completely irrational.

Sometimes you sort of lose control of your emotions where things just feel awful. When I was 19 I got dumped by my girlfriend of 3 years that I was head over heels for. I stopped talking to everyone and just became a recluse, not leaving my apartment for over a week before my parents showed up and banged on my door until I let them in. They drove the 4 hours up when they found out. (FYI people who are friends to depressed people it does help when you show a bit of compassion even if it is annoying and a pain)

Any negative event just gets multiplied by 1000 because you lose the ability to see what is reasonable unless you really focus or have someone to talk to about it. 

So if you want to help your partner with their depression just be there to talk to and be mindful of any needlessly cruel things you say or do. "
Randomly crying and being overwhelmed with feelings of uncontrollable sadness for no apparent reason.
"I suffered (and am in treatment for) major depression.  I was so shut down emotionally that when my Dad died it barely registered.  My wife eventually left me because she couldn't handle being around me.  I sort of understand because depressed people do suck to be around, but still.  

Anyway, the more important question is what you can do to help your SO.  Here's some stuff that would have helped me and might have saved my marriage:

(1) Taking the initiative and scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist for me.  When you are depressed even simple stuff like making an appointment can seem overwhelming.  Obviously you talk with her first rather than just springing it on her.  And take her to the appointment if you can - it's too easy to just sit like a lump and let these things pass by.

(2) Helping me get some exercise.  Exercise plus SSRIs plus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is what eventually pulled me out of the pit I was in.  Even just taking a regular long walk together would help.

(3) Run interference with other people who might be making demands on me.  When you are depressed even simple tasks are hard, so anything that lightens the load helps free up limited mental and emotional resources to fight the disease.

One other thing:  pay attention to her mood.  If she suddenly gets happy, watch her like a hawk.  Getting shot of depression is a slow process.  Sometimes when a depressed person resolves to go forward with committing suicide the sudden realization that all their problems will be over soon is enough to lift the immediate sense of gloom and leave them happy and relieved.

Good luck.  I know being partnered with a depressed person is a dozen kinds of shitty every day.  It sounds to me like you are doing the right thing by reaching out for insight and support so you can be there for her in appropriate ways."
"When I was in the midst of it, generally a lack of hope. I couldn't enjoy a nice sunny day because it seemed somehow sinister, and I think my perception of colors may have been altered? There was not just persistent sadness, there was a feeling that I would never again experience happiness and there was little point to being around. It helped for a time to become more physically active but because I was working a very toxic job and PTSD came into play, my efforts were overwhelmed which only fed it with feelings of failure and worthlessness, mixed up with symptoms of PTSD which amplified it and some of which seemed to taunt me. So, yay Lexapro! It helped the depression enormously, although the PTSD symptoms have needed additional work with EMDR. 

It's hard to explain in some ways but perceptions were altered, view of the world was altered, cognition was altered. "
"Genuinely thought I was dead for a year, and was convinced that this was hell or purgatory. Convinced myself that if my friend from the north visited and left, I was still alive. Friend was very confused when I was suddenly very chipper when talking to him on the phone when he had just spent a week hanging out with uber depressed me. Also lost my faith over that year. Got faith again now."
"I was in a terribly abusive relationship that left me in a crushing state of depression. I'm not sure if I have words for what it's like to be at the bottom of that barrel. Eventually I got out and started rebuilding. Now I'm married to a wonderful woman, and I can say it is like being a different person. When you're depressed I mean. "
"I would like to point out that it is important to watch the development of the person in question. A lot of people with depression can't judge realistically their condition. It comes very slowly and one day, you realize that it is not the case that ""everybody is sad sometimes"", but in reality you can't remember the last time you were happy. "
"The comic/blog from Hyperbole and A Half called Adventures in Depression does a pretty decent job of explaining it in such a way that people who haven't gone through depression can understand it.

Edit: words"
"I am currently very depressed and in a relationship with someone.

First things first. You cannot fix her or cure her. This is very frustrating because people tend to want to help and fix problems. My SO just wants to help me but can't. All you can really do is support them and be there for them when they need help with something. She helps me with things I cannot do, like making phone calls, scheduling things, cleaning my room, getting me up in the morning.

Try to understand that she can't just ""be positive"" or ""stop being depressed"" It is a real illness and while sometimes it will go away given enough time, it requires medication and/or therapy to improve the condition. Know that her feelings for you may vanish. People who are seriously depressed may have no romantic interest at all. They may be so consumed with trying not to want to kill themselves or be miserable all the time that they can't even think about a relationship.

It is very difficult to be in a relationship with someone who is seriously depressed as it can seem like they don't care about you, are always negative, and are draining to be around. I give you credit for hanging in there with her. Just try to do what you can to make her life easier. You can't fix the depression, but you can help her with things she struggles with."
"I think it's great that you're supportive of her. It really does mean a lot to someone who suffers. 

You'll need to learn the fine art of working out when things are too much, and when they need encouragement to do things. Sometimes, people with depression need a bit of a push to go out and do things, other times they physically cannot do anything. Be sure to communicate clearly with them so that you can both know what needs to be done ;)"
"I've had major depression. Try to find ways to distract her, find ways to get her to laugh, and don't try to convince her not to be depressed. For me when people tried to do that all it did was make me aggravated. Give it time overall and tell her you love her. /r/depression could help to. I haven't been there though, was depressed before I knew about Reddit. "
"I have depression, although I'm not sure which specific 'type'. I hope you don't mind me still answering the question though. Everything I'm sharing is only my *personal* experience; everyone is different. 

A lot of users have already shared what it feels like, so I won't talk too much about that. Here's my analogy, though: It feels like you're a gray, dirty, crumbling wall. Vandals spray vulgar words on you (your inner monologue of self-hatred), and there's no way to get rid of them. You're a wall, you're stuck – even if you *wanted* to get rid of the words (after all, depression saps all of your motivation to do anything, even the simplest or most usually-fun tasks), you can't move. You're so full of cracks that it feels like you're about to crumble apart. In fact, that would be much easier than straining to survive. 

You're asking about experiences, so here's my personal story. I'm in high school, and got diagnosed about a month ago. My parents started noticing my low mood around December, over winter break. I was failing – *did* fail – at least one class, with Ds in two others. Last semester, I got an incomplete in English, and am still making up the work (if I don't get at least a C, I won't be able to graduate high school). Before my parents knew I was depressed, they tried everything to get me to do my work. They took away summer activities, a school trip I had planned, would ban me from using my computer... Nothing worked. Nothing interested me. It didn't matter that I'd lose those privileges, because I'd probably just fail anyway, no matter what I did.

After winter break was over, my parents took my to see a psychiatrist. It was hard to be 100% honest with him, since I'm pretty private about my emotions, and he told me I had dysthymia. My parents and I didn't really agree with his diagnosis (like I said, I wasn't completely honest with him), but it was enough to get me medicated. I hated, and still hate, the idea of having to rely on pills for my happiness. They still haven't completely set in (I have more energy now, but I'm still unhappy), and at times it seems like the medication is pointless. I once forgot to take my medication, and was freaking out. When nothing happened for a few hours, I wondered why I was being medicated in the first place. I managed to get my medication before my mood could plummet, luckily. I've been on pills for a month.

I've also been going to therapy; I've only had four sessions so far. I'm going to be completely honest with you... I hate therapy. I dread it, and that's because I'm absolutely terrified of showing my vulnerability. I'm (irrationally) afraid of being judged, or pinned as insane (what if I'm 'crazier' than I thought?). It's really difficult, and I'd like to quit, but I'm sticking with it. 

In my experience, my best friend has been my biggest source of comfort. I find it best when she simply listens to me; I'd rather not be given advice. Even if talking to her is helpful, she still can't relate, and sometimes that feels very lonely. Just be there to support your SO.

"
"I'm going through an episode right now, actually.  Going on sites like Reddit and interacting is a way that I cope.  I feel like I'm on an upward spiral for now, so it's all good.  

With me, it's that I feel *nothing*.  I lose my ability to do anything that I normally love to do, and all I want to do is sleep and just sit in a dark room feeling nothing but wondering what it would feel like to bleed to death in a bathtub (I'm not suicidal, but I think about death a lot).  My motor functions even slow down, and problem solving at work becomes quite a chore.  Then, when it becomes overwhelming, I just sit and cry like a wild woman.  I'm not crying because I'm sad... it's just the only way I can feel anything of any kind.  

Whatever you do, DO NOT say things like ""Why not just choose to be happy?"" or ""You're so wonderful!  What do you have to feel sad about?""  People with depression can't just cheer up and choose to feel happy.  Just be there for her.  "

So numb that your mother can be hugging you, crying, asking where her baby went, her little bright sunshine of a boy, and you stare over her shoulder, glassy-eyed and empty, simply waiting for her to let go so you can go back upstairs and continue to be empty.
You.just.want.to.die.  You build a wall, an immovable object, around yourself. No emotions in, no emotions out.  No one cares about you or understands how you feel, even if they say they care.  You have no motivation, no interest, no happiness, no reason to get up in the morning. Every day is empty or full of despair.

Depending on how bad off she is, you may not be able to reach her no matter how hard you try.  But try. Please try. Try as hard as you possibly can."
"Nothingness and then there are the gaps.  It's like I black out or something.  I was just looking at my bathroom and I had never thrown away new boxes for the soap.  I just let them stack up in the bathroom.  I didn't even notice them when I was experiencing a depressive episode  and I would never do that if I was feeling healthy. I could be in a burning house and not even notice when I'm depressed. I have gaps like that a lot.  I just wake up one day and realize that I've just let life roll by without even interacting with it.  Often it feels like there is a piece of dirty glass between me and life.  I can kind of see, hear, smell, but not really; there's a filter on life.  I know I don't make any sense. It sucks. "
"I have Manic Depression and in my experience, it's extremely debilitating. Normally, I am pretty cool about everything and get things done even if I'm having a bad day. Normal feelings are easy to work through. Fighting with friends? Ehh I'll sleep on it, I have things to do. But then the depression is triggered by something (or at times, seemingly nothing) and it's EXACTLY like a physical ailment. I get something similar to nausea, except I can't throw up. Food is disgusting, I can't eat. I have a hard time swallowing because my throat begins closing up. Someone walks up to me and cheerily asks me ""Hey, how are you?"" and all I can do is stare blankly because what answer could I possibly give. The world is spiraling downwards and there is nothing I can do. It's like people are looking at you through a window. They just don't understand. They'll never understand. They are trying to get you to go bowling when you feel so awful, even though you fear death just as much as everyone else, you wish you weren't alive. It is 100% a disease. I've suffered chronic migraines my entire life, dislocated my knee, and used to be a drug addict and was beaten up/jumped multiple times. I have felt pain and I would choose anything physical over depression. 
     As her SO, please try to understand that you cannot cure her depression. It exists outside of you. You will never find the kernel that causes it, no matter how much you try. The best/only thing you can do is let her know that you will love her and be there when she's at her worst. She needs to know that there is light in the dark. Imagine she is in jail. She can't get out, and bad things are happening inside. She has nothing to offer you and it makes her feel even more awful that her incarceration effects you negatively. Keep visiting her, even when she says not to. Keep calling her. Keep writing her letters. Someday she'll be free and you two can embrace, but until then, let her know you love her for who she is, and not what she does for you. It's true for anyone going through it. People need to know they don't have to be happy and perfect for you to love them. "
"I had chronic depression from 13 or so until I was 22. Once I was far more sorted and looking back on it all, the thing that struck me was how mundane it all is at the time. I knew a lot of it wasn't good, but it was just my life. Even when I stared into a snowstorm and thought about laying down in it to kill myself, it didn't seem weird. I didn't even think of it as contemplating suicide until someone asked me if I'd had suicidal thoughts.

Others have said this already, but professional help is a big step in the right direction. Especially if you can find someone who's great for you. I went to five different therapists until I found the right one. I've always had people who cared about me deeply, and were there for me. I know that having their love and support helped greatly because I didn't have to go through it alone, but seeing a therapist was one of the best things I ever did for myself. 

This is something that will never go away entirely. There will always be moments when she falls into the same patterns or thinks the same way. The best you can do is help her live and think in a way that minimizes the impact on her life, but she has to do the brunt of the work herself. Good luck, and godspeed."
"It's hard to get out of bed, that's a cliché but it's true. You feel debilitated, as in physically debilitated. It's like your mind is so grey and blunt and in your mind vision you just see a pitch of black. 
I have every reason to be depressed right now but thank god I have learned that exercise fights depression hard, so I exercise every day and it works.

"
"After middle school all my friends left the school. Starting high school was a huge change for me and I felt really alone. To top it off I had diagnosed disgraphia, ADD, as well as mild case Aspergers syndrome. Basically I broke down. I couldn't go to school I was crying practically everyday, it felt as physically debilitating as it was mental, there were times when I quite literally could not move. Eventually with the right medication and a fantastic psychiatrist I was able to recover. Depression is tough. I hope your SO can pull through it. "
"It's a mixture of fear, panic, hatred of others, and self-loathing. The tiniest little thing can set you spiraling into one of these categories.

My girlfriend and I recently got out of this funk after 3 months. All I could do was be as supportive and as positive as possible towards her. *She* has to want to get better as well. 

Be encouraging if she wants to do something. Thank her for things. Ask her for small favors. Don't be negative or sad back to her. Sadness is infectious just like happiness is.

"
"It's honestly hard to put into words. It didn't happen all at once and was kind of a downward spiral into nothing. It starts out as sadness and just goes on to become a constant nothing. It's hard to feel anything but hatred towards yourself. At my worst my grandfather had died and I just didn't feel anything although we were extremely close. As far as suicidal thoughts go you I never thought I would even consider. As the days went on I started weighing the pros and cons of it. I still didn't really want to die, but it just became an option. After a while I had considered it heavily and was on the verge of ending my life so I decided to see a psychiatrist. Things are better now, but they're still hard sometimes. To anyone going through depression of any form, get help immediately from a professional. It's not something that gets better on it's own."

"I had what was diagnosed as a Major Depressive Episode when my sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer. With the family going through a lot anyway, the only person who knew was my SO. Each day I would fake being normal and trying to support my family, and each night I would be so exhausted at the effort of it all I would just pass out. A few months after she died I was made redundant from my job and I pretty much had a breakdown as it all hit me at once. I lost the ability and energy to fake being normal anymore. I just couldn't cope. I still didn't tell my family though, as they were trying to deal with their grief. 

It's a few years on and I'm still struggling, although I can at least fake it now. It still exhausts me and every so often I just cannot get out of bed, and I phone into work with a stomach bug or migraine as I wouldn't trust them to understand a mental illness. It helps really that I HAVE to get up on most days, there is no choice, so I get up and pretend. I think those that I work with would be surprised if they knew. 

I'm not suicidal, but I'd be pretty pleased not to exist and go through this day after day. "
"Im not sure if mine is severe but its getting up in the morning and hating everything, begin driving to school and just pulling over and sitting there for 30 minutes before turning around and going back to bed."
"If I quit taking my Prozac, I become suicidal in about 48 hours.  By ""suicidal"" I mean I start thinking about how to commit suicide.  I realize what is happening, i.e., that I do not actually want to die, but I cannot voluntarily stop thinking about suicide and why I am worthless.  From time to time my pharmacy changes the brand of generic Prozac that it dispenses; some of them do not work.  How do I know?  I start thinking about suicide.  The common notion that a depressed person can choose not to be depressed is completely mistaken, and in a relationship situation it is toxic.  Depression is a biochemically-caused condition, and the victim can no more cure himself by will power alone than can a person who has a disease such as cancer or pneumonia."
I go through varying waves of depression every so often. If I'm just feeling down i drink a little too much a little to often and try to numb myself up to the world. If it gets really bad then I'll come home from work and get into bed and go to sleep because being awake and conscious seems like too much of a burden. I end up becoming a shut in for a couple weeks. Just work and sleep and work and sleep. 
"The best way I can describe it is like constantly wearing a very, very heavy coat with a mind of its own. 

Think about it. Think about depression like a very heavy coat, and its only objective is to bring you down to the ground. You don't know how it got on you in the first place. You don't know why it feels so heavy. You don't even realize at first it's there. But it's *heavy as hell*. It confines your movements. It weighs down on your shoulders. You know you can unbutton it, remove it, you know it's not right for you to wear the coat all the time, but it's so damn heavy that the effort to raise your hand and unbutton it is incredible. 

The coat only lets you move as far as it wants to let you move, and the collar is up so high that you hear and see only what it wants you to see and hear. 

And most people don't understand it. They can ask you, ""Have you tried taking it off?"" ""Can you not wear the coat?"" ""You're not accomplishing anything while in this coat!"" - they wouldn't know, unless they wore it for themselves. 

Eventually your body adapts to the coat, to its weight, to its confinement, and whatever you know or remember of life without the coat retreats into the back of your mind. Getting up is an effort, but it's a familiar effort. You know that the coat is on you. You know that it's possible to remove it, but either the weight of the coat sapped your strength, or you just adapt and accept it as par for the course. 

That's what the coat wants. And it can get heavier, confining you even more, and obscuring your vision until you just can't see past the coat collar. And you know, at that moment, that it can bring you to where you won't be able to get up again.

But when you do muster the power to unbutton even one button on that coat, removing it becomes easier. When you finally battle through removing it, you fling it into a corner, but it never goes away. It's always there, in a pile. You may forget about its presence, but your body remembers its weight, its confinement; your mind always remembers not being able to see past it. And you always keep wondering if one day you'll find it on you again. 

 
From personal experience with the coat, as I put it, I felt...numb. Most of the time, it's not so much as what I felt, as what I didn't. I would get so frustrated with the fact that apart from just an empty blank space, I didn't really feel very much. It took a long time to fight through, and an even longer time to feel happy in any iteration. 

The best thing you can do is be there for her. Hug her and tell her it's okay. If she wants to be in bed for a day, that is fine - stay by her. Listen to her when she talks to you about what she feels. Professional help is very important, but what's also important is support from the people closest to her - and that makes a huge difference in pulling through it."
"For me, I would go to bed wishing my heart would stop, and wake up disappointed to still be alive. Every single morning I would think ""how the hell am I going to talk to people, smile at people, pretend to be okay?"" Life was exhausting.

One way I tried to describe it to someone once: it's like your mind is an open field, and you're standing there, and all of a sudden you can feel the rain coming. There's this black cloud building up in your head and you try to stop it, because it's your mind, right? You should be able to stop things from happening in your brain if you want to, right?. But you can't - that cloud builds up and builds up no matter how hard you fight, and eventually it bursts into a storm, and once the storm starts you're just useless for a while. It literally did feel like a storm in my head - like a tornado, really. The inside of my mind was all dark and thoughts were spinning around at 150 mph and I had no control over it. It was scary as fuck and exhausting and that's really why I was suicidal - being inside my brain sucked so bad I didn't want to keep going anymore."
For me it is having daily thoughts of hanging myself but knowing that would hurt my SO too much to actually complete suicide. It also means seeing a psychiatrist for over a year but still searching for the right meds (they are now adding a low dose of abilify to my wellbutrin and trintellix.  It also means feeling like a failure because my job is being a youth and family therapist and I can't even get through my own depression. It's been 2 years now and I am just so tired of this shit.
"In my case it was awful. It cropped up twice. The first instance was a year and a half of fatigue, emptiness, and feeling absolutely useless. The second was just a month ago and I've only recently felt better (if you don't count any of this week). I screwed up though, I didn't let my SO know and now he's pulling away. My advice? Let her know you're there. You can never truly understand how she feels, but you can be there for her. It's dark, empty, and draining; however having someone there for me was comforting. Does she laugh when you make a fart noise? Make the damn fart noise. Laughing is light, you forget (even if just for a second) that you're down. When you sleep, hold her tight. Make sure she knows you won't let go. She will pull through, just say strong."
"I've had it my whole life (hereditary). I mean, it sucks but once you've found the right medication regimen --- and yes, trial and error can be a part of it --- it's not so bad. 

On top of everything else I lost my job and have been out of work, which has added more specific depression. However, in addition to my medication my ailment has also given me years of therapy which has equipped me to deal with it in a healthy manner.

**tl;dr** It sucks, but finding the right medication and therapy regimen can help you cope not only with the disorder, but also with other things that may go wrong in your life.



**EDIT**: Oh, but to answer your question, there's a sense of emptiness and boredom. Like, ""So I get up tomorrow and do shit and then go back to bed. And then I have to get up and do the same thing, day after day for the rest of my life? Am I just waiting out the clock?"". "
I read several of the comments regarding a lack of interest or meaning in life.  All of this is true.  Consider a life where everything is gray and there is nothing colorful.  your favorite food is ash in your mouth.  There's a bleak hopelessness that's pervasive in everything you do.  You're lonely even when around your closest friends.  Don't mistake it for sadness.  I can still chuckle at something humorous.  
"It's when you are sad every single second, without perspective and intrusive thoughts.

It will drain your life day by day, every new one will be worse if you let that happen. 

She needs professional help and build some self esteem, discipline and healthy habits. 

ps: Exercise helps alot, you should support her, it is a hell if you feel no one is supporting you. "
"Someone can be saying irrelevant things like ""Hi, how's your day?"" and you feel tears coming and you wonder why you stepped out of the house.
You dislike people and get them to stay away because you don't want people to see you.
Everything's wrong and jumping out seems not really that scary.

There's really nothing you can do. Hug her maybe. Nothing much else."
"Had a 2ish year phase where I was really bad, I worked as a bartender, loved my job/co workers, but little did they know that unless I was working, I was home playing WoW like a religion, drinking all the time..good days it was just beer, bad days I'd be killing bottles of jack or whatever I was having at the time.

Feeling lonely, worthless, crying myself to sleep on a nightly basis, a big reason was I fucked up a good long term relationship and didn't realize the gravity of my mistake til I moved to the other side of the country a couple months later.

3 suicide attempts..almost made it on my 3rd..russian roulette with a bunch of random pills and woke up in the E.R a few hours later.

I can go on but I'm not about to write a detailed novel."

"Show her that you care. Depression can affect each person in different ways but it makes one feel very lonely and worthless. You feel detached from the world , hence the feeling ""everything would be better of without me"" which is very common for everyone who suffers from it. 
As some people have said above, if she's in a very deep depressive state then you probably won't be able to offer much help, but be there. Show her that she's not alone , she's not a failure , that she's important for you . 
It's a very personal problem so in the end of the day she will have to be the one to deal with it on her own - but it's a lonely road so if you can just be there to make her feel loved and cared for then it might make things better. "
"Honestly, depending on what she is going through, there may not BE a ""pull through"". Up front I have to say, if it is real depression (major or minor) she should seek professional help.

With that out of the way, I can say a few things that you should know. First, let her know in clear and certain terms that you are there for her and can help her, and listen to her. A lot of stress can be relieved just by having someone to talk to, to share an emotional burden or feelings or other shit. 
Second, depending on whether this is a life-long thing or a brief episode, cognitive behavioral therapy helps, and is something you can do without a professional (though it helps to have a therapist). This means, if there are certain ways of thinking or thoughts that she has that are detrimental/defeatist/depressing, she acknowledges them when they happen, and mentally refutes them. It is a bit more in depth than that, but look it up, it can change a person's thinking.
Third, TELL HER TO SEEK THERAPY. There is no shame in going to a doctor when you are sick, and there shouldn't be any when going to a therapist for mental illness. Having a detached third party to talk about your problems with is very beneficial, even if she will talk to you about her problems. Another advantage is that it makes it that much easier to get a prescription if it is deemed necessary, or something that she wants to try.
Fourth, push her to do things. With depression, it becomes very easy to close yourself off and not want to do things, even things you would normally want to do, and sometimes she will need to be dragged into doing things. Going out, being social, doing fun activities, these can all help with depression, BUT, it can be difficult to discern when a push is needed or when it should not be attempted, and could actually be counter-productive.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a doctor or licensed therapist, I just know about my own situation and what helped me, from living my entire life with dysthimia, and having a two year period of major depressive disorder, and am now on medication and going to therapy, managing my mental health. "
"IMO, you can't TRULY understand it unless you experience it firsthand.  But I'll try to explain.

You feel surrounded by grey, by bleakness, a despair that almost has weight.  The world seems to love kicking you down; things are always going wrong.  You feel like the scum of the earth, no matter how many times people tell you you're wonderful.  You can only focus on all the bad things that have happened in your life, on the mistakes you've made.  You begin to see yourself as a burden, a shame to society, and you believe the world would be better off without you. Some days, you feel catatonic, and you aren't sure you're even alive anymore.  You have lost all hope and believe you're doomed to be unhappy and alienated forever.

But there IS hope.  Today, I am happy, smiling, looking towards the future.  I still feel really bitter about things sometimes, but I've let go of a lot of things I'd thought would fester inside me forever.  I believe your SO can recover.  Sometimes, depressed or not, we feel like we've sunk so deep into despair there is no way out.  But there is ALWAYS hope."
"Finding an answer is the best thing you can do. Through all the meaningless chaos and apathy in the world, the only respite a person can get is finding an answer that fits them. Allowing yourself to let out emotions can be a way....

Honestly, many people are digging themselves a deeper hole in the split moment where you want to commit suicide. Best thing to do is to tell your SO to sleep on it. Depression can come with stress or lack of sleep as well.

The saddest song I've heard.....

">  I question sometimes (rationally) the point in living.

I feel this. My only real family is my parents, and really only my mom. I have no siblings. I'm nearly 34 and have no real expectation of ever having a girlfriend or wife. Kids are even more laughable. 

I have no interest in going back to school, I have a dead end job, a house and two dogs. The dogs are really the reason I keep going. "
"its a sad reality, but life sucks, it fucks you sideways, and then you die and none of it really ever mattered. you live to die basically, its sucks that this is what civilization has come to"
Your experience is similar to mine. I think the most interesting thing about it (for me- I cant say this applies to you or anyone else of course) is that when I'm okay I still know that life is ultimately 'pointless' but it just doesn't bother me. Its interesting how the objective facts don't change but the way we feel about them does.
"This description actually sounds like Major Depressive Disorder. 

Manic depression, which you mention in your post is something different. 

You may want to consider therapy and/or pharmacological treatments."
It doesn't matter that nothing matters. You don't need to change the world to live a meaningful life. 
"I feel like you are also being reinforced by the mild high you can get from starving yourself.  At least that's how I feel.  Soon after I eat, I get the energy to 'think' and in turn have a multitude of negative thoughts. "
"That's me about once every other week, rather just sleep for an  eternity that do anything. "
"When I stopped taking my medication I tried eating food, but my mouth was completely dry. It's almost as if my body didn't want me to eat, or do anything.. When you're depressed you lose the will to do anything."
This is me...am i depressed?
holy shit. thank you for sharing this video. it hits hard
"Oh my god, I can't believe how dead-on that *cartoon* was! Seriously word for word, everything that was stated/illustrated... I couldn't have said it better myself. I'm so glad you shared that."
"Im sorry you had to go through that. I don't know your case or your ex boyfriend, but I was somebody who dumped their girlfriend in the middle of her depression. For a long time I felt bad, I felt selfish. But I thought about it one day. For a year and a half I tried it all to fix her because she wasn't trying to fix herself. I tried being positive and giving her what she wanted, I tried forcing her out of bed and to school, I cried, I got angry, I screamed, I called doctors, I cried more and tried her to get into a mentally and physically healthier lifestyle. I even started to write her a book about how to deal with it, and how I felt - although I had no idea how to deal with it myself. One day I finally had enough, I broke it off with her for good (after many fights and semi break ups). I felt my happiness had dissappearred and I wasn't who I was anymore. Sometimes that's just the way people have to deal with things. "
Good for you the way people treated you after you were hospitalized was fucked up but I'm glad you made it through.
"I remember the real darkest depths of what I had, how actively horrible it was.

But what I have now, that chronic, moderate depression, is just as insidious. It's just like what you say. Maybe I don't wanna die, but life is just so hard, even if objectively it's not. You just deal and deal and deal, draining you away,  but you remember, maybe, at some point that it never used to be so hard just to live. That there's another feeling out there, one that actually feels good, that you used to feel more often than once a couple of months.

Onward to therapy and meds and the acknowledgement of hope that, even if I don't feel it in my heart, that I know it can be done."
I know bro stay strong ;) 
That quote is one of the best succinct descriptions I've seen so far; nice.
"It's the feeling (kind of true). That the entire fabric of our society and culture and social norms are built to the advantage of people who AREN'T depressed.  The world rewards outgoing, motivated, confident, driven,  emotionally in-control people.

It's horrible to basically have just been stuck with faulty wiring that basically makes you the OPPOSITE of what's required to mesh with the world, and it absolutely feels like a cosmic joke."
"You are so strong to have made it, even if it continues to be hard. 

I know that may sound hollow over the internet, maybe won't mean anything to you, but I'm someone who has suffered from depression and by nature of my particular illness will continue to do so periodically for the rest of my life. I mean it as more than an empty platitude.

Wishing the best to you and to all of us in this thread."

"Its more that supportive people must not take it as a fault of their selves if you have depression.  And this kind of narcissism is dangerous to friendship and life - it will ruin relationships and increase the volatility of the one suffering.  

you need to remember they are experiencing depression every second of their lives - in physical, emotional, and mental anguish.  They feel their past, present, and future are hopeless to a great extent.  

It is wonderful that you are compassionate and empathic enough to want to help.  that is very rare.  But you must remember this is not about you, it is about the individual who believes they are broken and not compatible with their life.  Things will be said with generalization and imperfect wording, do not try to hold them to this or use the ""But I didn't do that, did I,"" deflection because that just NULLIFIES their feelings and thoughts.  This nullification of their mental process is a defacto nullification of their entire selves.  And that is dangerous.  You are telling a depressed person that their thoughts and feelings are invalid and wrong.  if they are in a dangerous place, they may just snap."
"Try a little bit of everything until you find something that is worth your while.  I for instance feel good chopping wood....or creating things.  No, I'm never going to be that person ecstatic about anything or loving my life but they're small victories.  Animals, gardening, woodworking, any form of creating....all pretty satisfying in my experience."
"Yeah, one thing that stuck with me was in a Ken Burns film about Lewis & Clark, where Meriwether Lewis on his birthday was all depressed and questioning if he had done enough to change the world.  He was younger than I am now.  Pretty sure he shot himself...."
"That just means that its common to feel this way, not that anyone/everyone who shares this feeling will be able to make a change."
"On a large enough scale, *nothing* matters. You could annihilate the entire planet, and sure, it would suck for the planet, but the galaxy wouldn't even notice. But that doesn't mean that nothing matters at all. It all does matter, at smaller scales. And that's okay. It means it's actually more important to do what matters to you, rather than worry about doing something that matters to the world. If you derive satisfaction from doing something with wider impact, by all means, shoot for that, but don't feel like your life is pointless just because it might not change the whole world; no matter what, it does change your own bit of the world."
"Mmm.  There are times where I won't sleep for days, because my brain won't stop tearing itself apart until there literally isn't enough energy left for it to remain operational."

"I can understand where you're coming from. In regards to my ex-boyfriend, he was my world and he knew it. We'd been together for about four years and he knew I had issues with depression, but I was pretty persistent to not dump my issues on him. I relied on him at first (when our relationship was young) but after, as you describe, fights and semi-breakups I realised what stress I was putting on him, particularly because his brother was fighting cancer. I really closed up emotionally to try and make his life easier. 

I have no hard feelings against him, just like I understand why you ended things, I can understand why he ended things. However, the way he did it was poor. He visited the hospital every day and night for the first few days and then one day he didn't turn up. Instead, my best friend turned up and explained that he wasn't coming because he wanted to breakup. Honestly, I have never felt so heartbroken. 

It was a good life lesson though and time is a great healer. He's in a relationship with another girl and is happy. I'm married and happy. I know he regrets what he did though, I can see it in his eyes whenever we bump into each other, however, I'm glad I saw his true colours before we got even more serious; as blunt as this sounds, I dodged a bullet."
Love you.
Same here! It really makes me feel. Glad you liked it. 
"That’s it exactly, its wiring.  Or chemistry.  I see absolutely no difference between depression and, say, diabetes.   It’s chemistry.  I’ve never been ashamed of my depression, in fact, I never knew I was depressed, I thought everyone thought about suicide, I thought it was a normal part of life.    Turns out its just a normal part of MY life. "

Yes it means that they can take you into custody for fear that you are a danger to yourself or others.
"I can believe that, it is a very delicate point and experience. I was denied a psychologist as they thought medications and learning new routines would help me, something it did. Hope you are well now though."
"I've seen three therapists now, that have all tried pushing anti depressants on me. I'm really uncomfortable with it, because they're just throwing drug names out there willy nilly.

That and I really don't want to have to depend on pills."

my parents do not understand at all. I'm not sure if this will help but I am going to share it with them in hopes that it will help a little. I'm getting help so don't feel sad! been on antidepressants for a while but just started therapy
Im sorry he done it that way. That's pretty crappy. I'm glad you're both doing better now though. Just wanted to share my story because I was on the other side once.
The difference is people don't expect you to be able to just stop being diabetic.
Oh I see. Thank you for clearing that up 
"if one is suicidal or even in the neighborhood they should go and see professional help assuredly.  I was dealing with counselors and pharmacologists who were obsessed with 1-10 rankings, pills, and convincing me that my concerns were not really that troubling.   That it was all through my employer's health and employee care programs did not help.  And yes, that company did lay me off as soon as they could shuffle my body around enough to do it legally."
"Sorry, I wrote to a generic reader who is trying to support someone who is suffering.  I deal every minute of every day with my specters as well, I didn't mean to cause trouble.  

I just wanted to help those that want to help understand something. As depression is such a personal and varied affliction I tried to relate in as generalized a manner as possible.  you know, to take the ego out of it.   

I know I have lost people and relationships because they took my depression personally.  It seemed they got angry with me that they were not the miracle worker.  And then I felt guilt for making them angry. And that really angered me (with my self and the other) and set me further back from society.  Further from even wanting to want to be in society.  

I just build what I can myself, within or around myself.  Do a little thing every day that makes my immediate world better.  just a walk, clean something for a minute (even if its just putting crap in boxes), etc.  - then letting it make me feel less bad when I see it next. Then let it snowball the next day.  "
"I do have plans.  I just realize that in a few hundred years, my life won't matter no matter how much I try to be great.

And will my stepping on a butterfly negate the extinction of a species....or will the greedy assholes in power just nuke us all?  I call it being a realist."

"""The opposite of Depression is not happiness, but vitality.""

\- Andrew Solomon

Every little thing is work. Getting out of bed isn't just a thing you do, but a chore. You look in the kitchen, and think: ""If I get something to eat, then I'd have to get out the food, and cut it, and cook it, and eat it, and wash the dishes. That's a lot of work. I guess I won't eat.""

You think about every little mistake you've ever made, things normal people brush off like nothing, but instead you think ""Fuck, I'm worthless. Why do I even bother when I fuck things up like that. I'm worthless""

It becomes easier to seclude yourself from others because you don't want to disappoint them, or because if you hang out with them then you'll fuck things up again, or maybe because it's just *easier* to do nothing than to do something."

"Think of the most boring, horrible subject you could study and imagine reading a 50 chapter book on it. The total apathy you have for that task.

Then think of a time you really hurt someone you cared about, how it pained you to know what you did to them, the hurt on their face if they knew or when they found out - wallow in that self loathing or hatred and the isolating/lashing out feeling that comes from simultaneously not wanting to hurt.

Next, imagine the feeling of taking a test for that 50 chapter book earlier. Crank that test-anxiety up to 10 and the teacher is late so you can only wait and watch the clock while your stress over how much there's to do and you don't feel prepared but it's coming and you gotta do it but you're not ready (and on and on).

Throw all those emotions in a cup and drink heavily. Feel all and nothing for no good reason. Just trapped in your head with no escape and few if any sources of relief, and that relief is often just numbness. Just you and these thoughts, day in and day out, carrying them like walking around with a huge weighted blanket that sewn to your skin, yet people blame you for not just tossing it to the side."
"It's kind of similar to being so tired that sleeping doesn't make you feel better, just more tired. "
"It isn’t exactly just being sad, it feels more of like being stuck in a hole you can’t get out of, if that makes sense. You just feel empty with no meaning, essentially not fun."
"A it of people think it feels like being sad all the time... This is a bad misconception. When you're suffering with depression, you feel empty. Hollow. Void of any emotion 95% of the time. You want nothing, you have no energy to even work up a feeling of wanting to do *anything*. You're physically and mentally exhausted so badly that even working up the energy to *think* about anything is mentally taxing. Then comes sadness so severe that it's a literal weight crushing down on you. You begin crying so hard you can't catch your breath. All you can think about is how worthless you are, how worthless everyone else is, but maybe not, they're probably a lot better than you are at everything, but why? Why do they get to be so happy and carefree? It's not fair! You get angry, angry at the world for turning its back in you, enraged at the thought of all those people blissfully unaware of your pain, hatred for a world that is so full or hate and darkness, you're angry at yourself because *why do you feel this way??* Sure life is hard, but you have it better than so many people! Why are you so useless? Why can't you just get a grip already?? You're obviously broken, this is all your fault, you *hate* everything about you. Your hair looks hideous because you haven't washed it in 2 weeks, your face is oily and blemished, your clothes smell like they've been worn for a week straight without washing (because they have). You're useless, you have no skills that you can do anything with, you're so fucking tired. Tired because you haven't slept more than 4 hours a night for months (or so tired you sleep 15 hours every day), tired of feeling this brokenness, this void inside you, tired of how everyone seems to ignore you, tired of hearing about all the horrible things in this world, tired of seeing every one else's happiness. You are so. Fucking. **Tired**.... Tired of *everything*. Then your mind gives out, unable to feel this rush of intense emotions anymore, so it goes blank. Maybe you cut yourself to make the feelings stop crushing you for a while, or because you're tired of feeling nothing, because you need to be grounded by physical pain or distracted from the mental anguish. 

In short, it's emptiness with bouts of terrifying hopelessness scattered through. 

It's horrible."

"Imagine you slipped on the ice and landed on the pavement really hard. Nothing's visibly broken and you're not bleeding so you go to work/school like usual. On the outside you look fine, maybe your posture is different because it hurts to walk but nobody really notices or cares. Your leg hurts like hell but going home early would make you look like a wimp who can't take a little pain, and it'd take more effort than it's worth to make up any work you missed. So you suffer through the day, trying to do what needs to be done while ignoring the pain. As long as you're focused on something else it doesn't hurt so bad, but when you have a free moment to think it resurfaces in the back of your mind and you can feel it a bit more.

Fast forward a few days, it's hurting worse and worse. You finally go to the doctor, they tell you that you've broken a bone and angrily ask why you didn't come in sooner. You tell them you didn't think it was that bad, they scoff at you for not taking better care of yourself. They put a cast on it and give you some painkillers, then send you on your way with a pair of crutches. You go back to the usual routine, albeit a bit more slowly as the crutches make it harder to maneuver. The painkillers always make you too tired to focus so you try not to take them too often, which leaves you in pain most of the time. You know why your leg hurts, and you know the only thing that'll help is time. But that doesn't make it magically stop hurting.

All of a sudden people actually notice you're in pain, and they either tease you or give you advice you don't want.

""Have you tried putting essential oils on it, it worked for my mom's friend's grandma's mailman's cousin-in-law!""

""ICE to see you, buddy!""

""Aw that's nothing, one time I stubbed my toe really hard and I felt fine after a little while!""

""You wouldn't have slipped on that ice if you ate healthier and exercised regularly!""

The more people talk to you, the more isolated you feel. They don't know what you're going through AT ALL- how could they, you're the one with the broken leg. You can't keep pace with your friends anymore so they start to leave you out of activities. You start to distance yourself from everyone because you're tired of the broken leg being the only thing anyone talks to you about anymore, and you're tired of being thought of as a burden. But there's still things that need to get done, so you keep limping around with your crutches trying to do your job/schoolwork as if nothing's wrong.

Eventually your leg heals and everything goes back to normal, with the exception that people will still ask how your leg's doing even though you're fine.

...Until you slam your hand in a car door a few months later and it repeats.

---------

Now imagine that it's not your leg that's broken, but your emotions. No one can see it except for subtle clues that maybe even you don't know you're giving off. It gets worse and worse until you see a doctor and they diagnose you with Depression. The antidepressants make you tired and numb, but it's better than feeling that constant sadness. People try to give you advice on how to ""fix"" it because they don't know what else to say, but only time can help- time you can't spend waiting around for things to happen. Things need to get done, so you're trying to keep up with everyone as if nothing's wrong.

**You know why everything hurts, but that doesn't make it stop hurting.**"
"Nothing matters. You cook ramen noodles for the tenth straight night because nothing matters. You put off working out, or doing your favorite activities because nothing matters. It's easier to stay home and just...exist. But at the same time, you hate yourself for the complacency. You hate yourself for not being ambitious. You hate yourself for not feeling what emotions you used to feel. 

I should see a therapist. "

It is simple, it is lack of interest on anything at all. No interest in work, no interest in your family, no interest on entertainment.

And finally, there is chronic instant anger. which you will later regret thinking you are not that type of person.

"I can't really put into words what having depression feels like for me, but I can put into words how the first day of being ""happy for no reason"" felt like. I woke up like any other day and for some reason i wasn't tired. I felt energized and I noticed the birds singing in the background and found it slightly pleasant. I felt motivated to get up and wasn't dreading the day or even interaction with anyone at all. I thought ahead about what I was going to do and even decided If I did well on my test that was later that day I would reward myself with some delicious junk food. But then it hit, I was smiling. Smiling for no fucking reason. I actually flipped shit and called my mom because I had never experienced that before. I asked her if it was normal and she reassured me that it was. I asked her why I find every little thing that has happened today pleasant like the birds singing, the light coming through my window, my fucking cereal even tasted better! It took a while for her to convince me that I wasn't actually going crazy and that I was just finally not ""sad"" or ""depressed"". It was beautiful, honestly one of the best experiences of my life. Something many people do everyday was an eyeopening life changing experience to me. At the age of 22 for the first time I could remember I smiled for no reason and enjoyed a day like many people do. I wasn't tired, scared, nervous, anxious, suicidal or sad. I just was."
I want to hug all of you 
Like you're worth nothing and just being alive using resources and occupying a job someone else could have and a home that takes up space makes you feel so guilty and shameful.  Overwhelming feeling of shame any time someone looks or talks to you to the point where you're holding back tears. Just wanting to hide away from everything and especially everyone but your own home is a torture chamber of earthly attachments and the only plausible escape is to crawl out of your skin and leave everything behind.  
"Nothing during the day entertains you. You go through the day hoping to find some spark along the lines but it never comes. Then it’s coming to a point where it’s around the time to go to bed but you don’t really want to. You end up scrolling through your phone but you’ve already have done that and have seen everything possible you could. There’s “sigh okay” moment, because you realize it’s finally time to go to bed. Repeat the next day."
"Like I'm trying to see through a pair of glasses but they're all fogged up and no matter how many times I try and clear them off, they fog back up making everything look shitty and grey.  I feel like no matter where I look or what pair of lenses I put on, when I'm depressed everything looks and feels shitty and grey.

"Imagine having a bad hair day, maybe you feel a tad bit under the weather, perhaps you got in a little argument with a close friend and you had a bad nights sleep...it’s also gloomy and you’re just feeling “blah” so you throw on your sweats and go through the motions just trying to get the day over with. That’s how it feels for me EVERY day even if those things don’t happen and it’s a beautiful day...I still feel like that 24/7. It sucks. "

"Awful. It's constant hate for being alive. It's feeling empty while wishing it were true. I just graduated college with honors, and here I am at 11:46PM drinking gin until I blackout after being awake 40+ hours due to constant suicidal thoughts. This isn't even the first time this week that I have done this. Every night I have to convince myself not to be greedy and take the whole bottle of sleeping pills I have on my desk with alcohol because my parents would miss me and I don't want my body to be found covered in my own vomit a few days later. I just want everything to end.

Edit: If anyone reads this, please do what I didn't and seek help early if you think you are depressed! Please don't let it ruin your life, it's generally not nearly severe as mine if it's treated early and correctly. "

"Trying to be happy is like trying to tune a radio when the frequency keeps changing. You might get snippets of song here and there but they disappear quickly and are hard to find again.

Also, it has really bad and underrated physical symptoms. Severe tiredness and cloudy thinking. This is because depression is like a bloatware program that runs in the background hoggy your brains RAM. So you've got to work and interact with other people when you're just so mentally tired all the time. And of course, because you're tired you do this badly - which the depression picks up on and feeds off. "
Heavy weight dragging you down but there's no way to loosen the grip.

I went through a brief period of depression in early high school. Instead of worrying about grades I just didn't care and only wanted to sleep. Being awake just reminded me of my failing life. I had a desperate longing to be unconscious.

"My heart goes out to all of those who have responded openly. Having depression can sometimes be crippling.  I have had to fight it for most of my life. Not always, but I have bouts of it that seem to just snowball into a downward spiral. You lose energy, ambition, even most of your emotions. You're not sad your just here. No good, no bad just nothing.
 For me its always been the worst at times when I think too much.   Especially if I think of world events and things that I really can't do anything about.
   Over the years I have learned to catch myself and zone out. By that, I mean blocking all input into me from newspapers, television, the internet pretty much everything. Instead I focus strictly on things I need to do or need to do for others. Anything but dwelling on ?.
 My last bout brought me into learning how to play a piano. Not good, but I can tap out a few tunes now. It's also what got me to begin learning Spanish and some European languages.
  Depression is a challenge just like everything else in life and you have to be able to deal with it in your way. Be it with medication, meditation or just having something to do. 
Never be ashamed to ask for help. More people are understanding and have been there than you might think."
"Feels like absolute crap.

Edit : reading this thread is worrying, most of the posts hits close to home."
"Immense self hatred. Knowing I really really should just die. Remembering every single time you hurt someone close and being unable to do anything about it. Wanting to do anything other than being on the bed, but not doing it, hence fuelling self hatred even more. For me it's just a constant snowball from damn, someone was angry on me to I'm worthless, I need to die. All the while not being able to shed tears or having any catharsis at all. You also know you need to talk to someone but you don't want to call anyone. It's the worst. It's ruining my life"
My ability to enjoy life has been replaced with distant hazy memories of what happiness is supposed to feel like.
It's like death but it's nothing but darkness and pain
"With my own bouts of depression, I like to attribute the feeling with being in the ""upside down"". Life as you know it is happening all around you, but you're in a very dark place. Almost everything you experience feels grey, you're prone to dark thoughts & negative ideals, you become a glutton for emotional pain, and any attempt to introduce something happy is rejected or resisted at almost all costs. When you're not thinking about how grim things look around you, and how darker things might be moving forward, you're thinking about when death will come and relieve your suffering. I can't speak for those who self-harm or have attempted, but I've ruminated on the idea of death to the extent that suicide becomes a contemplation point. I've been too spooked about taking it that far, myself. 

The truth is, for me, depression by definition becomes a destination; it's where you are, and where you're perspective is. And I'm slowly but surely beginning to work on the idea that, like all emotions, depression is both temporary and separable from the person. I would have remained inseparable from my ""upside down"" if I had never sought help from my support system and a professional. 

Getting help, no matter how raw one might appear or present, is the best thing one can do for oneself in that situation: Depression is no joke, and, if you're alone with it, communicating with someone about where you're at (as opposed to simply how you ""feel"") is one out of many steps on the journey to obtaining a better self. 

Edit: Formatting."
"It's like living in a vast, lonely wasteland with no one but your own self for company. You're on your own for what feels like a lifetime. You're stuck in a separate reality from the world, friends, family where you want to desperately escape from but at the same time you don't and you want to remain there forever. "

"It was hard to describe to my wife. I had it pretty bad.  All hope and desire leaves you. Everything you love you still love, but you don’t find the point in trying to do anything with it. The desire to interact with anyone is gone and you just want to sleep and forget about everything. Nothing helps. 

I tried to commit suicide but ultimately didn’t. I had friends who had before me and I remember not wanting to cause something like that ever. So I felt trapped. 

I took anti depressants and they didn’t really help. I was numb. I felt nothing. I didn’t laugh but recognized stuff as funny. I didn’t smile or was happy for the birth of any of my sons. I am now but when I was on that shit?  Hell no. You were lucky to get any type of enthusiasm out of me. 

Pot helped. So did exercise and knowing what to do. 

You don’t know peace until you’ve suffered. "
"I always imagine it as living in a glass bubble. 

The bubble is a barrier. You can see other people and you know they’re close in proximity but you’re separated and you can’t connect with them. 

The bubble is dark and puts a dark spin on everything you see. A happy moment just doesn’t mean as much to you as it does to others. The longer you stay in this darkness, the more you stop looking outward because it’s not worth it.

The bubble isn’t soundproof but it dulls it. You can hear friends and family but you don listen because is not clear. You can hear Everything they say but it has no meaning. What they say doesn’t matter to you.

The longer this goes on, the smaller the bubble gets until you just have enough space to gather yourself in a fetal position and wait to die."
"Like nothing.  It's not a feeling, it just sort of... is."
Having zero motivation to even get out of bed. Ignoring bodily functions even.
"For myself, it comes and goes. I wouldn't say that I suffer from severe depression, in the sense that I am always plagued by it. For me, it will just hit me all of the sudden and I just feel almost numb. Well, numb isn't the right word. I still feel physical sensations, but all of my emotions and emotional attachments are almost none existent. The thought of sitting there and staring at a wall is as appealing as playing games, however it requires less effort, so it tops the shortlist. Whenever it hits me, I also lose all appetite. Which, for me, isn't all too hard to do. I forget to eat sometimes, or I will be hungry, however something else is on my mind or keeping my attention, so I just put it off in the background, I will still feel hungry though. When it hits, I have no want or will to eat. I always want to just sleep it off, but sleep is never the logical choice, because there is so much that needs to be done, and I can never feel like I haven't accomplished something, or like I'm not actively moving towards the goal of completing a task. So I just sit there, and stare at everything and nothing. There is also, on occasion, a dull feeling in the pit of my stomach. Not necessarily like I am going to throw up, or the feeling of nausea, but more like the uneasy feeling you get when you know you are starting to get the flu. Mostly it's like that time at 3 AM when your body wants to sleep but your mind is awake, and you can't seem to pass out even though your body is dead tired. That feeling of no matter what you do, you are going to feel that way. Then it goes away after a few hours. 

It only happens every couple of weeks or so in my case. "
"Sometimes i lay awake at night thinking about how everything bad is my fault, and im a waste of space, and i shouldn't make people bare my existence. Then i fall asleep, and wake up and lay in bed, because whats the damn point? Its like im always making myself feel like im terrible, and people should hate me, and i dont deserve anything good in life. But thankfully this is the longest ive gone without feeling that way!"
"For me, it's many of the things already described in this thread but also I just feel guilty all the time. Guilty that I can't just be happy with the life I have. Guilty that some days I can't even do the bare minimum my partner asks of me. Guilty that my partner works to support me and I just sit in the house being sad. Guilty that my family lives like a 15 minuet walk away and i never visit them because that would mean showering, getting dressed, and walking, when i barely have the motivation to go to the bathroom until I'm bursting. Guilty that I talk to my friends online maybe a couple of times a week, and sometimes longer, but they're always there for me.

I just feel like, why do people waste their time on me?"
It's just easy to be sad all the time and that most of my happiness or enjoyment feels temporary. Feel worthless a lot of the time and can't channel any thoughts to make myself feel better. Constantly feel sad about every little thing. I struggle to start conversations with people and pretty much end up having only a couple people to talk with.
"It doesn't. There's nothing to feel.

You aren't sad. You aren't happy. You just... are."
"Imagine everything you enjoy being turned into work, almost everything takes effort, save for maybe eating. And when you try doing nothing you just hate yourself because you're being lazy. You feel stuck in a routine you hate and don't know what to do about it"

"So the best way I can describe it is a wall between what you should feel and what you do feel. 

Example: I went on a roller coaster. I used to love roller coasters. Now, when I go on them, I feel nothing at all. No fear, no adrenaline, no surprise, like my emorions have been muted, 

Now apply that to everyday life. Also, sometimes you just... Don't feel like moving. You cry over nothing. You can't even convince yourself to take a shower. 

Sucks, man"
"When it started, I had a lot of depersonalization. I started to believe that I had no effect on the world. I engaged in a lot of reckless behaviours because I didn't believe anyone cared or noticed.

Oddly, at the same time, I also felt heart-tighteningly, gut-sinkingly guilty for the smallest things. I was crossing the street and a car had to stop so as not to hit me? I'm a horrible person for delaying them and should have just gotten hit. Etc.

Then my sleep schedule started getting fucked. I had nearly a month with no classes or exams during university and I started staying up all night on my computer and sleeping at 6 am. I started avoiding all human contact, only venturing out of my room when my roommates were away or asleep. At this point I felt... just numb. Nothing really affected me. Good, bad, I didn't care. I wished I could sleep forever because my dreams were far more exciting than real life.

Then the anger came. I started dating again, started trying to force myself out of the house, because logically I knew I was close to losing my friends. But I started lashing out at my partner all the time. You never knew what might set me off. The most innocent comment could be warped by my sick mind as being an insult, and it happened all the time. Anger was the only emotion I could access, and it felt good to feel something.

This continued for years, although I got very busy and that seemed to keep it under control, or at least keep me exhausted enough to not get quite as angry as often. Otherwise I just felt like I was sleepwalking. I went to school, work, parties, etc., and did my best to act normal and get shit done. It worked, I mean, I got a Master's degree, a full time job, and no one ever suspected I might be mentally ill except for my partner.

The moment I realized I needed help was when I was going on Facebook just looking for arguments. I was shitposting and arguing about literally anything. I had already realized by this point that I was probably depressed and my anger was due to this. I messaged a friend with mental health issues and experience and he took me to the mental health hospital the next day. I was diagnosed with severe major depressive disorder and put on Sertraline (Zoloft) immediately.

Most people can't claim this, but the meds worked instantly. Within hours I felt like I had more energy, like colours got a bit brighter, like I was waking up from a long and boring dream. I did some therapy but mostly it was the meds that got me to the point where I had any extra energy to do more than the bare minimum. I also stopped lashing out in anger for petty or non-existent reasons. I am still on meds today and if I forget it's usually not a big deal, but say if I go away for the weekend and forget to bring them, I can feel the irritability start again.

TL;DR like a veil of numbness and anger

"
It’s like a feeling of worthlessness that doesn’t ever seem to end.  A never ending void.

"So you have dreams, right? We all do. Depression makes it seem like your dreams are unreachable.

Furthermore, it makes even fixing normal issues feel impossible. Can't get friends, can't get good grades, can't lose weight, etc. 

It sucks."
"I feel a constant headache, like something's bugging me in my head. I feel like I have a sword constantly stabbed through my heart. I feel like I'm chained down to a bunch of weights, being pulled down to the floor. I feel like my body is damaged.


I feel alone when people think they understand me."
"TL;DR
It is miserable it's not being sad or anything else just a destructive taint on your soul
 
It eats at you. It’s is not something that comes on suddenly, you don’t wake up one day and think ‘I am depressed’. It claws and nags slowly building inside of you. It is a stench that you cannot was away. Things happen that can affect it. You can have bad days or certain situations that maybe set you off but true depression is not situational, it is just innately inside of you. Maybe it starts with something small but slowly it takes over everything. You struggle to find joy in anything. You no longer enjoy sex or exercise. The work that use to bring you joy is gone. Food loses its taste and you begin to forget to eat because you don’t see the point. You try to make a list of things you enjoy but you cannot. You think if there was a way that I could just not need food wouldn’t that be lovely. Your apartment starts to get messy, you don’t care. The three days of dirty dishes that live in your sink do not matter. The pile of laundry grows but you don’t deal with it. You avoid it. Self-care no longer exists because you don’t care.
You try and hang out with people and meet people but whenever you aren’t alone you are terrified you are going to cry and it doesn’t bring you any joy. You want to be alone. You lock yourself away you stop talking to people you stop reaching out but that doesn’t help either. You lie, say you are busy or say you have plans. You put up a veneer, an act, you could say. It sucks. You attempt to hide and bury what has become your true self. The ugly slime that you cannot comprehend. What has become your true self terrifies you. 

Even when you are with people you feel alone. You feel isolated, as if you are not understood, even people that have gone through this or people whose job it is to look after peole like you seem estranged. You don’t want to be alone either because then your mind begins to take over to tell you all the things that will never happen and why it isn’t worth stuggling along anymore. You are scared that one time you will slip up and listen to your brain listen to the million little voices that are telling you that you can’t do this that it’s not worth it that people won’t even miss you that much when you are gone. You need all the energy you can muster to fuel that single voice of dissent, the lone sane voice in the crowd shouting its complaints. You try to drown them out with peoples’ company but you don’t enjoy it and it reminds you that you use to enjoy peoples company. It just takes too much energy to be with other humans and listen to their days, it’s not like you want to talk about how you feel but you can’t really talk about anything else because nothing else exists. 

You get home and break down. You don’t have the time or the energy to be sad but you can’t do anything else. It becomes cyclical, you are stressed because you can’t focus or get anything done. The amount of energy to make it through your day is more than you have. You don’t have the reserves to do the things that need to get done, they just are not there anymore. Showering becomes something you can barely handle. You lose things, miss deadlines and fail exams because you can’t focus because all your brain power is being used to fight this. 

Emotions are like sine graphs they oscillate, with each wave being affected by what goes on. You have euphoria when the coefficient is massive and you are on top of the world. There are dips either big or small, that hurt. You come down but the incline is visible.  You have ups and downs but with a constant baseline. Depression takes your baseline and moves it to below any trough you have ever experienced. Events that would have made you euphoric or content in the past barely cause a bump in the function. Unfortunate events are less massive as well because there is a numbness that has seeped in. The definition of sad is something you have to change. You aren’t sad, sad doesn’t describe it correctly. 

People say it will get better in time but you don’t believe it. Every day is a struggle and the passage of days are so long. You don’t have anything to look forward to. You keep setting dates in your head when it will get better, maybe once your physical situation changes your mental situation will improve but it doesn’t. Each landmark and goal you set for yourself doesn’t change how you feel, you don’t improve it actually gets worse. You had expectations and they are not met again and again. The energy it takes to get out of bed is almost unfathomable so you wake up early and cannot fall back asleep but you just lie there knowing you have things you should be doing but you cannot force yourself to move. You say there are things that you want to do. You want to be in love again, you want to get married, have kids, have a job you love but those things aren’t true. Those are not the things you want, what you want is for the pain to stop.

You don’t have stressors or triggers, there are not reminders that make you sad, you just are. Maybe a song sets you off or something that someone says but that just makes you miss something. You don’t miss a feeling that is now just a void. It moves into apathy, you hope maybe it will just be easier not to care. You wish you were one of those people who wasn’t emotional, a systematic human being who just got things done. 

You look for little victorious. Getting out of bed is one and making it through the day. When a dog pulls on its lead so you can pet it. You then realize that these are not enough anymore. 

There is no respite from it. Nothing you can say or do that brings you joy that distracts your brain. You start running out of options, you need a break you need to not be miserable for maybe 15 minutes but you cannot find anything that takes it away. You start to think to yourself that maybe physical pain will distract you. You think about taking a razor to your wrist, not to kill yourself but to distract yourself. You have to convince yourself that it isn’t worth it and you don’t want scars to remind you of this time. You can come up with reasons not to kill yourself, mainly your mother and what it would do to her. Maybe you know people who have killed themselves and have seen what it did to their families and you don’t want to destroy yours. Having reasons not to kill yourself is different from having reasons to be alive. You run through ways to commit suicide and for each one you come up with a reason not to. Not the end result but the act of doing it. Either you don’t like needles or it is too messy or someone would have to find you and that would really be tough on them. You don’t want to hurt people, all you want is the pain to stop. You keep telling people you will not do it, that you are smarter than that, that you will take the necessary steps to prevent it. You also have to tell yourself that, you have to convince yourself that it is selfish that it is a simple solution to a complex problem
You think, how long would it take and who would notice if I just disappeared. You want to cease to exist and truly believe it would be better off if you were not here. People wouldn’t have to worry if you were okay and you wouldn’t burden anyone with your feelings. You hope for an accident, a plane crash or a single car accident that just takes you out. Yes, your family would be sad but they would know it was an accident. You shouldn’t be worried about if you are going to admit yourself to the ER but every second you are. 

You think about maybe using drugs and alcohol as a respite. Just to not feel like yourself anymore but you remember that drinking to remember is okay while drinking to forget is not. You take the necessary steps and take the alcohol out of your house. Romanticizing the past and thinking about when you were last happy is something you try to avoid. It doesn’t give you any respite. You don’t want to think about the past and how you use to be but you also you try to remember that you were once happy. You try to hold that feeble flame in your head to think that there is something you are fighting for. But the flame slowly flickers and dies. It loses fuel and the slow and steady wind of depression in the end snuffs it.

"I think asking how it *feels* is the wrong question. It doesn't really feel like anything. Emotions are pretty diminished.

I think the real scary thing about depression is how it makes you *think*. You see the world differently, worse. It's like life is this long empty road stretching out ahead of you with not a tree or a rock or a feature for thousands of miles. "
"You have no motivation, no desire, and no will to do anything. And it only gets worse if you have a parent that refuses to see it and/or help you through it. So much worse."
Like someone threw a king sized wet comforter over you. 
"Self loathing, apathy about taking care of yourself, fighting to get through the day, wanting to sleep just because you hate being awake, moving at all feels like massive amounts of work, and when it's really bad, feeling despair when you are happy because you know it's short lived."
"My analogy for how it feels to have depression is like this: say you are at a theme park with a big group. Now, imagine that the whole time you are there, you are very thirsty. Thirsty to the point where you feel a bit of agony, but not pain. You’re still doing all the fun park stuff like getting on rides, playing the games, checking out the attractions, but the entire time, you can’t enjoy it because you are still thirsty. Even if you drink water, you will only wet your tongue and later on you just know that you’ll be thirsty later. You know that where you are is fun and you know that you would otherwise be enjoying it, but you can’t get there because this thirst won’t let you. And then you figure that if you just sit down, maybe you won’t feel as thirsty. You still do, but this way, it’s not as bad. 

That’s how I feel anyway."
Hopeless and helpless 
"Great.  Life full of sarrow, always feeling really heavy, lacking the will to live.  Being disappointed every time i wake up.  Feels great 10/10 would recommend"
"There is no joy or hope.  Everything is hard.  I remember when I first started taking antidepressants and that veil lifted and thinking, 'Is this what normal people feel like?'.  I am now off antidepressants and doing well.  I have what I call 'My address'.  I wrote down the things I believe to be true, the things that are good and when I am going through a bout of depression, I tell myself the sadness will not last and I will find my way home again.  I taught myself the good was real and the bad was temporary."
"AAAAGHGGHHHGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
AAAHHHH! AAAHHHHH! AAAAHHHH!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHGHGHHGGHGGHFFFFGHHGGGFFKKKKKKFKKKKKKKKFUCKFUCKFUCK!!! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!!!!! AAAAAHHHHHJHHHHGHHHHHHHHHH"
"My girlfriend came into the room and told me she was pregnant, showed me the tests. My response was as if she said ""I picked up some milk from the store"".

I should have felt something. Anything. Happiness, excitement, fear, sadness.....something. But it was just nothingness. I'd never knew what real depression was until I started taking the steps to get out of it and learn about it.

Edit : downvoted for sharing my personal story with depression. Excellent."
Like being beat down slowly. There are highs and lows but the beating fluctuates. 
Do you know what it's like to feel lonely and nothing in life matters? To never feel like to smile or laugh. To cry endlessly because you can't do anything to help yourself 
Feels like there is a physical weight where my heart is slowing me down every minute of everyday. Everything just feels like it’s not worth it.
"I don't always want to kill myself. But a lot of the time I do. It's a state of existing when you feel like you don't exist. Some times I lose days worth of time. I space out. I forget to shower, or eat. I struggle to fall asleep and then sleep for too long. Sometimes getting out of bed seems impossible. When it's really bad I can feel physical pain from it. Medication helps, but not 100%.  I don't know who I am."
"For me, it feels like I don't have a purpose. There is no goal that I can see at the end of the tunnel. I isolate myself from others and live in a perpetual pity party. I feel bored most of the time and I don't find enjoyment in my hobbies on bad days. 

You just feel alone.

Some days are better than others. But it's always there tugging at the back of your mind."
"For me, it felt that no matter what I was useless and almost subhuman. 
I always told myself that I don't deserve friends, happiness, a caring family, or even to live. I thought I deserved all the terrible things that happened to me and accepted it.
The only thing that got me out of it was getting engaged to my childhood love. 
The engagement ended really badly, but at the same time it gave me the confidence to realize that even with my faults, I'm a great person. 
Life will be shitty sometimes, and make you not even want to live it. 
But there'll also be times in life that'll feel almost unreal yet real at the same time.
I know that reading about this almost never helps (at least for me) but believe me, life will get better, you just have to hang in there "
Like there’s this void in your body and nothing you do seens to fill it.
"Numbing, tired (all of the time), anxiety, 0 motivation. It's a chore to even use the restroom or take a shower, because why? Life seems pointless, and it's a never ending cycle of the same bullshit. I'm not suicidal, but I would have rather not existed. Also, I pretend to be human a-lot, like a-lot a-lot."
"It started for me in about 7th grade for no reason, always had everything I've ever needed in life, great family, nice roof over my head, a girlfriend. Around midway seventh grade year I just didn't feel me. It felt a chore to wake up everyday, my grades started slacking, and simple tasks like showering became mountains to climb. It was around this same time by best friend started going through the same motions. 

Flash forward two years, I'm a freshman in high school, playing Varsity football and rugby, life should be good. Right? Far from it. My sister ran away from home, and I blamed myself for it. Stop showing up to sporting work outs, fuck myself over and fail 3 of 5 classes I was taking. 

Senior year, graduating, dating the girl I'd had a crush on since 8th grade, life should be a slice of pie. But it wasn't. Waking up everyday was monotonous, talking to people was a waste of time, although I never used my time accordingly. 

To now, I'm a college drop out, working 27 hours a week. When playing sports I was a solid 215 pounds of muscle, now I sit at 260 and can barely run 10 minutes without feeling exhausted. I sleep in til noon or one on days I don't work, and even then it takes my mother coming into my room to get me up to even get me going. I feel like my life isn't real, like I go through the motions just because it's what society tells me to do. Believe me, I want to go back go school, get a good job, start a new family with my amazing girlfriend, but at the same time, how can I do that when some days I can't even find the motivation to shower. I feel like I'm stuck in a loop, one that's impossible to break, and even if I saw the chance to break it, I'm not even sure I'd have the will power to do it. 

I've talked to a therapist, been on meds. But it doesn't work for me. And the real kicker of it all? I have no reason to be depressed, because my life has been a cake walk. 

It's hard to explain, to be quite frank. But my god I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. 

EDIT: To tell you some more, I have not many interests that I actively pursue. I feel like a burden to most, if not all, people. I wish some days I just hadn't woken up. I feel no sense of urgency, regardless of how urgent the matter is. I eat and eat and eat until I feel like a worthless piece of trash. "
"For me, it feels like really wanting to go home but then realizing you are home and for some reason that fact doesn’t bring you any comfort. Like you want to go somewhere very familiar but then not recognizing that place anymore once you get there. "
"I have bipolar depression. It’s been getting bad lately. I hate it because I have a daughter but some days, I won’t get out of bed till 2, I won’t shower for a day or two, my house will be a mess, I might be crying or just have a blank stare, I feel extremely hopeless like everything is shit and I can’t do anything to fix it. I get paranoid I don’t care enough for my daughter and feel empty, stupid. I just feel empty. 
Then ill have moments where I spend the whole day keeping myself busy and being in a pleasant mood while I talk to myself and forget to eat all day because I’m so “busy”. I went on job interviews and just goofed off because I just didn’t care anymore. I said whatever and laughed and joked instead of taking it seriously. "
"Like you have tripped over and landed in a puddle of all that negative shit like sadness and despair. All the while happiness, ambition and all that good stuff continue forward down the road and you will never quite catch up to them."
"The only way I've described it effectively is with this analogy:

You're in your house with all your rooms. You wake up in bed and think 'God i don't want to go to work' but you do anyway. So you go to your study and start working.  After work you shower in the bathroom and make dinner in the kitchen and then watch tv in the lounge room. 
The next day you get up and think you'll skip work today, it's not like one day is important, and the work you do isn't really meaningful so what's the point?
You still shower and cook and watch tv. But there's an existential crisis sitting in the back of your mind discussing what the point of your day is. You're not really contributing in any meaningful way, just kind of existing.

The next day you wake up and skip work again. You skipped it yesterday and it didn't matter. Also returning to the office today would be too hard. So you skip showering as well cause if you're not working then what's the point in showering. You still make food and then sit and watch tv but you cut them out earlier than expected and sleep.

The next day rolls around and you don't even think about work. Cooking seems a lot different today. Food tastes bland and doesn't seem like it was worth the effort. You still watch tv but all the funny stuff you used to watch just isn't funny. Now the sad stuff is leaving you weeping on the couch while you think about how worthless your day was. Tomorrow doesn't exactly seem better or brighter either because really, what have you got to offer?

You sleep and wake up the next day. All these rooms you used to use, your kitchen, your bathroom, your office, they're gone. They're forgotten about. You don't use them anymore. It feels like a day or two has passed but it's really been months and you just sleep or watch mindless tv. The only emotion that seems to get through anymore is weep inducing sadness from your depressing movies.

Soon getting out of bed seems like a struggle and drinking yourself out of your mind makes you feel better, cause at least while you're drunk you can feel something. Of course now, every hangover leaves you feeling guilty because you haven't attended the office in months and you can't really afford to drink. Though its better to feel something than to sleep and cry.

Then one day you wake up and everything is dark in your room. Your bedroom door hasn't been opened in days. The curtains have been shut for months. You see a slight sliver of sunshine through the crack in the curtains and think 'I don't want to live like this. I don't want to live. The light in my life is small... I'm surrounded by darkness and i don't know how to let more light in.' Opening the curtains is the hardest thing you've done. As you stand there squinting out the window at the glorious sun you realise you need to make changes. Feeling this way isn't normal. Life should be better than this.

At least that's what I felt."
shitty
"You have no energy to do anything, you have no passion, no goals, no care.

You wake up in the morning, you question if getting out of your covers is even worth it, when you do get up, it took a lot of strength out of you.

You stop giving fucks about yourself. Room is messy? You look sloppy? Your hair oily? Your nails dirty? You need to diet? Meh. 

You start thinking the lowest of yourself. You make a mistake no matter how small you beat yourself over it, sometimes you feel like crying about how useless you are as a person if you fuck something up bad. 

The person you hate the most is you, and you wish like you never born. But here you are, and it fucking sucks to be you. 

You will hate the outside. Dating? Who the fucks will date your sorry ass? Trying new things? You to dumb to learn anything. Going out with friends? They are to fucking happy. "
"When you ""feel depressed"" it means you're in a bad mood, and ya need to suck it up buttercup... 

When you're genuinely depressed you just don't feel anything. You're periodically go into a short panic wondering why you aren't sad over the death of a relative, or ecstatic over a vacation to a far off location, but the panic is always short lived because... remember? You just don't care.


When I was depressed, I was never really sad, or lonely, or angry, or happy, or sympathetic, or excited, or scared, or thrilled, or even bored.

Life just happened, until one day, for some odd fucking reason, I woke up and realized that I was 19 and decided to fucking go to college that summer... ~~ever since, and I am still having occasional bouts of extreme apathy, I've been steadily getting more ""feeling"" if that makes sense.~~

~~For instance I started tearing up when a favorite character died in a tv show, and it shocked me so much to actually be feeling something again, that I burst out laughing.~~

~~I never got help, or any of that, I just kinda... quit being depressed, I suppose I got bored of it? It's kinda hard to explain.~~

I lied, I'm still depressed... The above is what I wished happened... but it didn't. College is tiring."
"fucking terrible. imagine, your life: every day feels dull and unimportant, and they all bleed together. Everyone's cheerful attitudes seem like a glowing farce, and sometimes i wonder if everyone else is actually happy or faking it like I used to. 

Being cared about feels nice, but being given advice from people without depression becomes condescending, and most people will brush off one's serious needs for mental stability to fit you in a box they can label and pretend to understand. Or others suddenly try to take control of your life for you, taking decisions out of your hands, because they pity you/dont believe in your ability to handle it, despite doing so for however long you have lived.

 People treat you differently if you tell them you're depressed, and they either have the audacity to try to solve your problems with a few sentences of faux-know-how, or they shut their emotional door as if your mental state is too deep a rabbit hole to look into. 

Everyone will love to tell you to ""go talk to someone"" but you're attempting to already by speaking up to them and asking for advice from familiar faces first; they always dismiss your attempt as soliciting perspective from someone unqualified, despite their insistence that ""all you need to do to turn your life around is ______!"" Even if you do go talk to a therapist, it's not always a successful method of creating coping tools. When it doesn't work for you, others will tell you that you didn't give the therapist a chance or try hard enough to change. Now your depression isn't important for them to recognize anymore because they ""tried to help you"" already and it didn't work, so they give up. So fucking many give up as if you're a child throwing a tantrum for attention. It hurts, it sucks, and the judgment doesn't help you improve. It makes you question everything you know about yourself and how others perceive you instead of focusing on finding strategies to cope.

Most people will give you an opportunity to explain why or how you feel like you do, and listen for about 5 seconds before retorting with ""you're making excuses, stop feeling sorry for yourself."" Oh yeah? the scientifically proven chemical imbalance in my brain is an excuse now? Thanks for discounting serious biological issues and treating it like the afflicted chose to be this way. I firmly recognize the difference between situational depression and innate, biologically-influenced chronic depression. Most don't act like there's any difference at all.


11 years of clinical depression has taught me nobody really understands the struggle unless they're in the thick of it. Nobody but you feels the creeping dread of existential meltdown every night that you stay up til 6am because you know if you sleep, it'll be nothing but nightmares. Nobody but you feels the anxiety of society's judging eyes that you're not playing nice with the rest of your peers in the 'expectations sandbox' they built for you and wont let you leave. Others dont take you as seriously as you do, because they insinuate your depression is linked solely to your own choices. I know this to be false, but many others turn a blind eye to real issues so they don't have to attempt to help you and feel like THEY failed.

If I hear one more time ""oh don't worry everything's going to be okay, you have so much to be grateful for"" I'm going to lose my shit. I'm grateful for every day that i wake up and dont feel violently sick, despite how few they are. I'm grateful for the roof over my head and the food in my mouth and the clothes on my back. All of which I worked for and achieved. You know what I'm not grateful for? Assholes that don't recognize that depression has nothing to do with personal expressions of gratitude, or appreciating the good fortunes I do have. It's about being unable to dispel the physical and emotional turmoil that hovers above me through most of my experiences, like a torrential downpour built for one. 

On the outside, i'm outgoing and jovial, joking and funny, extroverted and fearless. Inside, I'm a black hole whose influence is ever expanding, shredding entire galaxies of my life in nanoseconds, suffering under the weight of my own gravitational pull folding my insides upon themselves, and everything i have consumed creates nothing except more entropy. 

Those who know me best know exactly how introverted I really am, or that my social anxieties have always been masked by my desire to see others happy and make them laugh since I do not feel that happiness easily. Never underestimate one's ability to hide their problems, and in my case, I instead help others when I need help the most. It's the coping strategy I chose because it's the only one I can find that turns negative into positive, and doesn't ruin the lives of those around me, but enriches them. If I'm not happy, I hope someone else can be, and i live vicariously through that moment to appreciate what it might feel like to be.

tldr: it blows"
"Like a bone deep hurt. Like your dog died yesterday, but that's every day. It feels like waking up, and going back to sleep, not because you're luxuriating, but because sleep was less painful. It's never having enough energy to do all the things you need, and rarely enough energy to do the things you want. It's the slow death of wanting things, as the joy slowly seeps out of you, and all you're left with is an empty 12 pack, an empty carton of cigarettes, and an empty feeling inside.

Also it almost always comes with anxiety, which is like drowning in white noise, with a constant low level panic. Until it turns into a panic attack. Then it's high level panic."
It doesn't.

It doesn't feel like anything. You don't feel. You just want to not exist.
I'm so glad you had to ask this question. May you never know how it feels first hand!
"hate to admit it, but isolation is a trigger for myself. it's not that cool to work at home on my own, doing whatever I want, ""living the life"" I needed contacts, people, fortunately events were put in place for me to go outside more.."
"It feels like somewhere down the road you lost yourself, and you desperately search your mind for where the once happy or at least content you had gone. You feel embarrassed constantly, you feel worthless. You can't get up some days, most days. People start being very careful around you, which makes it worse. You hurt the people closest to you because you feel the need to alienate yourself yet at the same time there is this loud internal scream begging for someone to let you out of yourself. 

It feels like your life is going by without you, and everyone is going somewhere but you, because you are in a bed that you cannot seem to get out of today, and then tomorrow, and then the next day... "
"There's nothing *to* feel.

"Every day is the same.  Constantly feeling like you're in a state of despair and you can't find joy in anything you do, including things you used to enjoy.  You can smile and laugh, but in the end it's all a facade to fit in with the rest of the world because everyone else will give either fake advice or ridicule.  On the inside, there's just nothing.  You're tired all the time, even when you seem to get enough sleep.  

You cry or get angry about small things or for no reason at all.  You don't want to talk to anyone about your feelings, but at the same time want to cry and hug someone to stop the horrible feeling of loneliness.  You want to have friends, but push them away to be alone instead.  Sometimes you just want to go slit your wrists in the bathtub and make it all go away, but you're too afraid to.  What will your loved ones think?  They probably don't care, but they might.  Who knows?  It's a vicious cycle.

Just described my situation.  Kinda just vented."
"It feels like there’s no being in the moment, it’s all a vast pointless wasteland."
"It's not so easy to describe IMO. The other comments do a good job so far!

For me it feels like I'm detached from myself and everything, basically. It doesn't matter if my life goes good or bad; I just don't feel happiness. Doing a good job and being called out by colleagues? Doesn't really matter. Playing my favorite game and scoring some nice treasure? Doesn't matter.

When I look at myself and my life as it is right now, I have no need to be worried or sad - I got a fiancee, a job, a nice flat, and enough money to make it through the month without too much struggle. It's all good, but I don't feel it. I still feel like I'm failing and like I'm on to break or fuck up.

What goes with all this is some sort of anxiety. There's days were I can't leave the house and can't go to the store to buy food, or get my mail done, or clean up / fix things in my flat. I feel drained as if I have no energy left.

I know people who're way worse off than me, and I have the huge privilege of working from home, so ""not-leaving-my-home"" doesn't interfere with me making a living, but there's still days where I just don't feel anything and my mind keeps telling me it's all worthless and I don't deserve anything in life. These days are the hardest.

Sometimes I also have ""good"" days were I'm full of energy and want to spent it all! I learned to not use these days to really make the things I want to make (work on a project, for example) and I try to enjoy every minute of them. Eventually, however, the numb and dark days return, because this is the default state of my life and my mind.

I sometimes realize that there are people who are not like me, who're happy and who enjoy their lives, who are really sad sometimes and endlessly happy at other times (I almost always forget that not everyone feels what I feel; Or sees me/the world like I see it). When I'm deep down the hole I envy them and I wish I wasn't sucked down again and could instead just enjoy things."
"A feeling of ""hopeless doom"" no matter what you do or don't do."
Not wanting to do anything. Not wanting to be anything. Not wanting to be at all. I don't necessarily want to die. I just want to have never existed.
"Imagine being terribly sick. You can't enjoy anything, everything sucks and you can't imagine a life outside of it, you feel foggy and numb, and, well, pretty much everything about being really sick."
"Depression is the complete absence of emotion and motivation. When I suffered from it, I was essentially living my life on autopilot for a long time before realising that I wasn’t happy and that the things that used to bring me joy no longer did.

When your life is built around routines, it’s easy to lose sight of why we do the things that we do."
"Right before you have your breakdown it actually isn't that bad, mostly because you no longer feel *anything*. It's odd, like being in the eye of a storm. If you have any inkling of what's coming, yuo at least have time to make arrangements (for example, properly drop out of classes instead of just stop showing up), and decide whether you'll fight your way back out or if you'll just let it win this time."
"Feelings? Lol, cry every time, but you can’t even do that so you don’t even feel real sadness fucking right. "
It's great actually. You don't notice it through the hangovers.
You know what the hardest part is? When you've had a few good days and start to think you're improving then come down again. It's the starting over from the bottom each time that kills. 
"I’ve suffered with depression for over 30 years.  I take medication (and had to go through several before I found the right one) and it has saved my sanity.  Looking back at my latest episodes, they were like moments of complete self absorption.  I didn’t prioritize my kids, work, friends, or anything but myself and my completely consuming thoughts of worthlessness and hopelessness.  And simultaneously being conscious of this selfishness didn’t help me snap out of it but only brought on layers of guilt and despair.  It’s a deep hole that, for me, took medication to crawl out of.  Before medication, the most effective strategies were making goals, short and long term, and focusing on accomplishing those.  And although that strategy did help me to become successful at many things and in my career, it never removed the underlying feeling of, I don’t deserve this. And it also feels like you are balancing something very unstable, because as soon as something bad happens, like my divorce and all the waves of grief that followed, the depression consumed me like a dark animal just chasing me all that time and finally catching up.  For me, only the right medication helped me not only break free of that animal but stop seeing it in the corners all the time.  I’m at peace now, but there will always be a piece of me wondering when it will catch me again."
Very numb.
"For me depression has many faces. 

Sometimes I'm hyper sensitive and can't stop crying, and any little thing will set me off. 

Other times I just feel numb and empty, and in those times the main thing I'm aware of is feeling heavy. Those are the days I struggle to get out of bed, because my mind is blank and every muscle feels limp and dead.

Self loathing days are also fun. Everything that happens reminds me of something I hate about myself, or just makes me feel like a worthless person. I tend to have a lot of nausea and vomiting on those days.

Other times I get really antsy and can't settle to anything. Like nails on a chalk board all day long. 

Mix and match the above however you please, and wait for the ride to be over and a better day to (finally) arrive."
"Everyone’s comments have felt very relatable to me, but to add, it’s also very very lonely. 

You stop talking to friends about your life because there’s nothing good to say about it. There’s nothing that feels positive or exciting to share and there’s nothing anyone can do to make you feel better. Your ability to feel like you’re having a good time when you go out feels forced. You’re exhausted so you make excuses to cancel plans. You isolate yourself at home. You lose your confidence and ability to change the circumstances of your life that are making you feel worse. You feel guilty at the thought of spreading your negative feelings to anyone else. You feel shame that you’re not strong enough to overcome them. It feels like you’ll always be in this cyclical battle with yourself and there’s really no point in continuing to talk about how you truly feel. You know it just bums people out, which makes you feel worse. "
"My therapist once told me if I couldn't explain what depression was, there was no way I could have it. I spent the most financially, physically, emotionally, and mentally strained years thinking this.

It's been ~3 years since that, I know I don't have to explain It, especially not to myself but I'll give it a shot.

Think of something you need to do. Doesn't have to be important, maybe like brushing your teeth. You think about how you need to do it, but the task never seems to get done because a better opportunity may come, like after you go to the bathroom. But it never happens.

Then after 3 days you realize you haven't done the task, so you force yourself to do it. You feel like you've accomplished something, but then realize how unimportant and meaningless the task was in the first place. So you get upset that you haven't done it before now. It throws you into a mindset of not wanting to do it anymore because you know subconsciously you were upset by it. 

Then you have the big tasks. This could be anything important, work, school, kids. Anything you don't want to mess up. You get stressed out about doing it, causing you to procrastinate until just before you need to do it. Then you look for the affirmation from your ""judge"" (boss, teacher, spouse/children) and they're reaction can completely alter your day. A bad comment could literally lead to you sitting alone for hours thinking about how you could've fixed it. A good comment could make you wonder if they truly meant what they said, especially if it's about something you're not confident about.

Then there's just the day to day conversation you have to have with yourself

""Get out of bed.""

Why? I don't want to

""Get ready for work""

Why? I hate my job I'll just get fired

""Call _________ and do ___________""

I'll do it later I don't want to.

I'll type as much of this part as I can but it's tough to talk about.

At one point I was ready to commit suicide. With a wife and a kid and 2 kids later on down the line. O felt like they would be so much happier with me gone. I felt like they didn't really need me around. I felt like nobody wanted me around truthfully. I felt like there was this nagging pain I could never explain in the back of my head. Always there. Thinking of every opportunity to end it. Big cliff? Jump off. Oncoming train? Run in front of it. Busy traffic? Stand in it. Driving? Slam yourself into something.

I'm having a tough day already so I'm gonna stop here. For anyone wondering my wife and kids are safe. No longer with me, but I've NEVER thought about harming them. Not even once. I love them more than anything. If not for them I wouldn't be here typing this.

Thanks if you read all this. Hope I was somewhat accurate in my description I can get off topic sometimes. "
"its subtle, and it creeps in almost without you noticing. It starts with being busy, not necesarrily busy with work, but things in General. you slowly realise its been weeks since you last spoke with your close friends, but its fine, they are also probably busy. you think its time to arrange a catch up with them, but you will do it a bit later becasue you know you will be busy the next few days. 


A few more weeks pass and you are feeling overwhelmed with all the stuff that has been keeping you busy. low priority tasks start to get postponed as you need some time to ""unwind"" when you get home. you dont feel like making dinner, but prefer to just sit on the Sofa browsing something on the Internet. the TV is on in the Background, but whatever is on isnt that interesting anyway. you guess its time to go to bed, but your not ready to get up off the Sofa yet so you will just watch one more YouTube Video of someone folding paper or something. 


Another Weekend rolls around, time to catch up on all of those things you said you were going to do during the week that you never managed. its 13.00 now, really should get out of bed and go Food Shopping. its fine though, you can just make some boring Pasta... besides, its raining outside, you can do it monday after work. its now 16.00 and you realise you have wasted another day not going out. how can you waste your only real Chance to go out and do something? are you stupid? why are you wasting your life away like that? ok, its not a Problem, starting tomorrow you will get up early and accomplish some things! but you said that last Weekend and still you failed. are you a failure? what is wrong with you? 


Its now more than 4 months and you havent met up with any of your old friends. its ok though, you have been tired and busy with stuff and they havent been in touch, so i guess they also dont mind. its been weeks since you last did a proper Food shop, and you cant remember the last time you made a proper meal. you cant even remember the last time you rode your bike. its the end of summer now, you regret missing the entire season... you missed all the opportunities to go Swimming, hiking, having a few drinks in the sun. was the whole season missed? did you just waste the whole summer? 


You continue to drag yourself along. Routine Tasks are left to the last Minute. you go to bed later and later everynight as you see no Point going to sleep. When you wake up you dont see the Point of getting out of bed as you already know you will waste the day anyway. why are you even trying? how do you escape this Situation? wouldnt it be just easier if you didnt have to face these questions? what if you just got away for a while and escape the unfinsihed Jobs and responcibilites, you know nothing serious, just a small ""accident"" and you had to spend a few days immobilised in Hospital. you could get hit by a car, that wouldnt be too bad. you wouldnt want to damage someones car now, that would be a bit inconsiderate. you wonder how it would feel getting hit by a car? what if it was a Train? it would hurt probably, but you cant remember the last time you really something. you try imagine what the pain would feel like. Are you really fantasising about hurting yourself? was it weeks or months since you last felt any real Emotion? Are you dead on the inside?  remeber when your friend was showing you their new gun? that would be painless right?"
The only thing I looked forward to was falling asleep because then I wouldn't be conscious. 
"Had depression since I was a kid. Can't remember why, but it started with the panic attacks. Always crying for no reason, and I mean no reason. Was put into therapy at the age of 10. I'm 26 now. And always questioning why was I being put on antidepressant. What was SO wrong with me that I had to be in therapy several  days out of the week until I was 17... I know now that I was on both Zoloft and an ADHD medication to help me cope in school. I would always sit quietly and keep to myself. But it seems that any time I would open my mouth, I would be verbally bullied by classmates... I dealt with constantly feeling alone. My parents and siblings would just tell me to suck it up and get over it if I was ever in a depressing mood. It made me even more depressed that my own family didn't even want to be around me... I didn't want to be around them either... 

To this day, I still have the same problems. Days where I cannot help but sleep. Days where I just want to be alone. I will push anyone away, verbally attacking them to just be left alone. If I ever become overwhelmed, it induces self harm. I always hide what I have done to myself, in fear of judgement. I'm terrified of what others would dare think or say if they had seen a scar. They probably think I'm a freak and would want to send me away to an institution... 

I've tried other medications, but they only work for a couple of months and I just fall back into that hole... The hole that feels like I'm in the basement of the world. Where it's dark, and time is frozen. No matter how much I scream and cry to get out, begging for someone to just help me... I fall back in. It's the feeling of drowning in one's own emotions that are out of your control. It's a never ending war that makes you question... Why? Why am I like this? Why do I have to force myself to get out of bed. Why bother? What's the point? Why am I still alive? There is NO meaning to my life. I should just end it. Who but a handful of people would miss me, or even care. Who would mourn me? Who am I to the billions of people on this planet. Nobody. Just some woman, crying for no reason. Hoping someone out there can relate. Suicide is always, always on my mind. That's something I haven't been able to escape.. I have this obsession with death, dead things that make me feel for a second that I'm not alone. Amongst the living I feel alone... One day... One day, I'll have the courage to end it all like countless others have. 

But first... I must try and get out of bed...

"It's like accidentally dropping ketchup on your brand new t-shirt, but the t-shirt is your life and the stain never go away.

Except if you chew some Tide pods..."
Seems like a lot of you are struggling with your spirituality and sense of purpose in the world. 
"People are complicated, so not everyone will relate to this analogy, so take this with a grain of salt.

Imagine two dials, one is for all positive emotions (joy, happiness, love, excitement, energy, passion) and one for all negative emotions (anger, jealousy, boredome, pettiness, exhaustion, etc). Depression *at least* is taking the first dial and turning it off, or close to off. In some cases, the second dial gets dialed up, or even dialed down a little. Either way, you are left feeling little to no ""good"" feelings while still generally being able to experience the full gauntlet of bad, though you might be left only feeling a general feeling of emptiness, a dull ache.

I am not a therapist, but I'm of the opinion that the reason some people with depression end up in situations of self harm, eating disorders or substance abuse is that you get to the point where you just want to feel...anything. Anything at all to break the emotional monotony."
"No motivation. The excitement and will to do things is gone. Small tasks seem like a mountain to climb. You don't really take care of yourself. Sleep is the only priority, and deep down it feels like you're in this endless blackhole. It's like being consumed by negativity and nothing. Unfortunately, it also pushes many people away. "
Depressing
"Have you ever been super passionate about something? Where it feels like you have this raging fire burning inside of you, driving you forward?

Now imagine that fire is gone. Nothing is driving you forward. Some days, your biggest accomplishment will be getting out of bed, let alone making coffee or even eating. 

Depression is that feeling where you know you used to give a shit about something, but now you don't. And even worse, you don't give a shit about not giving a shit."
"It's fighting yourself to even get out of bed, exercise, see and keep contact what little friends you have left due to you distancing yourself because you view yourself as a worthless piece of flesh who'd have a better function as compost.

It's the feeling you get after you remember the energy it takes to do minute tasks, and how little energy you actually have because of your extremely broken sleep schedule caused by vivid night-terrors and always being encompassed into a dull, grey void. where even smiling is a burden to complete. 

it's *trying* to do a normal task and end up crying for some completely unknown reason. being unable to catch a breath and choking on your tears.

it's *knowing* you're not okay. but you're struggling to find the words needed to get help. 

It's not being understood by anyone and all you get in return is ""well just do *this* and you'll be better, it worked for me"" and ""just be happy, you're just having a phase"" when this has been an ongoing issue for as long as you can remember. 

It's that feeling of utter disgust when you look in the mirror and see the greasy hair, the blemished face, the wrinkles that have formed at the ends of your lips from being unable to smile, the worry lines on your forehead and the bags that now reside under your eyes after countless nights of broken sleep. 

It's the complete hopelessness when you know its not worth trying to do anything anymore. 

You start self harming to ease the pain, you get drunk daily to be numb to the pain. the pain then increases until you either fully give up and end it all, or you become addicted to the pain relief and keep doing it until you look back in that mirror and see what depression has done to you. You see that you're even more disgusting and thoughts of being unwanted and not needed by your own family start to fester. 

The worst part? It becomes **normal**.



"
You are afraid to be awake. 
"It feels... sad (except all the time). So not only do you feel like shit, but the reward pathway bites the dust and you lose your motivation. You sort of float through life aimlessly, not really experiencing it."
"Like having your favorite meal set in front of you, and you have been starving for days but you can't get up to eat it, because some kind of magnetism pulls you down and away from the food.

And you look around, and everyone else is eating normally. You start to wonder what is wrong with you, why can't you just get up, but every movement you make takes away all your energy. And some days, the magnetism is so strong it pulls you further away and all your progress is lost.

Eventually you start to feel yourself melting into the ground and just existing, knowing any effort is futile. "
"I'm currently in the throes of what I suspect to be postpartum depression. It feels like sitting in a dark hole and wanting to stand up and step out but just not having the energy to do it. Also there's a baby and a toddler taking turns screaming at me for not being present and my house is filthy and I haven't showered in five(?) days and anyone I could possibly talk to probably doesn't want to hear me complain because I asked for this when I wanted children and I'm so lonely all the time but I'm never alone..
It's challenging."
"Empty. It feels like nothing. No joy, no sadness.... just the void. It may also feel like... not empty, but not usefully full. Like a lead pudding. It takes effort to start moving, and nothing feels easy anymore.

For me, I either couldn't sleep, or slept too much. I'd get food (I was living in the dorms, so I had a meal plan) but I wouldn't eat it, or I'd eat a few bites and waste the rest. I filled my time with the internet, but did nothing productive. I spent most of my time literally lying on the floor, wrapped in blankets, staring numbly at my screen.

I'm better now. Still not well, but I'm rebuilding a firm foothold over the pit. The antidepressants helped, though I'm glad I'm off them now."
"A lot of good examples, but it really varies. I usually prefer when you don't feel anything. You become an empty shell and just go day to day, minute to minute. I prefer this to when you just feel like everything you do is wrong, you're worthless and you just hurt everyone around. But in any case, you just put on ""I'm alright"" smile and no one even notice that something is wrong with you, maybe you're just tired. "
"Your body is alive, but your emotions are dead. "
It feels like you are perpetually being downvoted. Everything you do and say is wrong and you hate yourself because of it.
You don't feel at all.
I literally will sit around just looking at my homework sometimes since I feel like it won't help me moving forward. Hard to look forward to do stuff.
I feel like I lose my mental and physical freedom when I'm depressed. I feel like I don't have control over my own mind. There have been times I thought I was losing my mind because my depression will often make me have stupid bad anger. I will literally throw a fit and pull my hair because this anger takes over my mind. I've also wanted to kill myself multiple times. I never thought I would ever have thoughts like that.
"Nothing. Just nothing inside, and you know it. The awareness is the worst part, because if there's any one thing you feel, it's guilt that you can't bring yourself to care."
"That's the thing, it doesn't feel to have depression.

and the only routes that seem available from there lead down into worse things that lack of feeling.

You feel in the way, and burdensome. You're self-deprecating to an awful degree.

Pretty much it sucks. You can try never to find yourself there but if you don't know what it is you might not notice its coming. and if you don't leave a trail of breadcrumbs or a golden spool of thread or something else indicating the way out you may end up feeling lost with no way out.

But hey if you just keep trying literally everything you can think, and do proper science with repeated trials and such, and keep on despite a lack of noticeable progress, one day you oughta find yourself out of that dark place and you can remember where it is and only go back to gaze into it from time to time.

It's pretty tricky, but we can be trickier. It can be a whole boatload of effort, though."
"not feeling anything. it creeps up on you when you start doing things just to feel that emotion.

i guess this thread has more than one type"
"imagine all of your family and friends, your favorite foods, a theater that plays your favorite movies and shows, your favorite games, everything you enjoy in life. imagine all of this on a boat.

you are under this boat, under the water, connected to a chain that leads to the dark abyss bellow you. constantly pulling you, trying to drag you down.

you can fight against the chain, force yourself to swim against the pull. force yourself to get on this boat, and do these things, you might even enjoy them. but you will always feel the chain pulling you, trying to get you back under water.

another option is to just let the chain win. let yourself be dragged down to the dark depths. 

I choose to go with the first option, because it is so much easier to fight this chain when I can actually breathe. when I can see the sunlight. 

I go to work, See my family and friends, play my favorite games, go out and buy the things I need to buy. I do these things because I see it as me telling this darkness that I refuse to let it win. 

I would love to just stay in bed all day, but I wont win that way. I refuse to let this chain drown me."
"Depressing



Cold and dark"
"Exhausting. There are days where you just loose hope and want that everything just *ends* (although I never wanted to kill myself, I just want everything to stop) and then days when you seem happy and think to yourself ""Oh, I'm so happy at the moment, I don't really have depression"". Then when you go home, lay in bed and can't sleep depression hits you and it's quiet and you're alone with your thoughts, stress and self loathing.

So, not so great."
I literally spent so long staring at nothing having loads of work to do and just can't do it and I know I'm not being lazy because it's not just the work it's literally everything is so fucking exhausting and I'm overwhelmed BY everything in my life I swear getting out of bed in the morning is just A NIGHTMARE and the worst thing is I can't fix it because it's not just something wrong with my life or something happened that made me sad . NO it's just something wrong in my brain . And it get sworse because I just keep thinking that what if I'm faking it and UGH ITS JUST TOO MUCH....
"can t enjoy things anymore, can t feeling a good or bad feeling, u are just angry, bored, sleepy, lose interest in everything"
"Better than pretending to be happy to please the never ending needs of others. 

At least that's a starting point anyway. 

Other times it's just the reality that life and people do kind of suck. "
"People often assume that depression is a big thing, but it really isn't.

Depression is finding it harder than normal to get out of bed in the morning.
Depression is finding that everything you did for fun, doesn't seem all that good anymore.
Depression is finding that food you enjoy, tastes kind of bland.

For me anyway, its like a blanket. Everything seems kind of dulled out and a bit numb. It's like being in a hole that's just a little to deep to get out.

But just throw down a ladder, you hear someone say. Part of you thinks that might be a good idea, most of you thinks that it's safer to be inside that hole."

"Nothing is beautiful.

"Depression is something which is completely different for everyone. For me; it's like a constant itch. You sometimes forget about it but it's always there and it pops up every now and then. You can scratch it, and it might help, but you can sometimes scratch it and make it worse. There are good days and bad days. I've been depressed to the point of suicide and I've been depressed to the point of having a bit of anxiety and sadness when I wake up. It is a totally mixed bag and no two people are the same. 

I think the worst feeling is the emptiness in my tummy. It makes you nervous, it makes you sad and very paranoid. You feel like everyone is out to get you and sometimes it's all too much. "
"Apathy, listlessness, and no motivation "
It feels like nothing.
It's very empty. Nothing holds meaning... It's like living in a bubble you know you need to do better... but you can't even convince yourself to get out of bed to even try... some days I don't shower or do much at all... It's not that I enjoy it.... You exist but it's only that.

"It feels like an invisible wet blanket is draped over you, just weighing you down.

It feels like there's a black hole in your chest where any joy you normally feel is instantly sucked into and dies.

And the most telling thing for me is how aware I am that nothing is causing it. There's no external reason why one day I feel fine and one day I want to die. It's just like a black cloud has randomly decided to settle above your head and the only thing you can do is wait for it to float away."

Sometimes someone or something comes along and empties it out and there's nothing you can do about it.

After enough times you start to ignore the jar. It's empty inside, it's empty outside. Then you realize the jar doesn't matter because you can't fill it anyway."
"It feels empty. There's some bursts of emotion, like anger, frustration, loneliness... But mostly it's just a lack of emotion and a lack of desire to do anything. You wonder what point there is to do doing anything. You don't enjoy the things you used to enjoy. You don't want to do anything, but you have to continue with your daily routine at school or at work.

You can still feel happiness when you're depressed. It's just few and far between, and it's overshadowed by all the negative emotions you feel."

Everyday is Sunday. 
"Being depressed isn't being sad all of the time or constantly wanting to kill yourself. Most of the time you actually feel nothing. Imagine what it feels like to pass that test that you have been studying for. Imagine what it feels like to sit down and play a couple of games, or whatever you do for fun. Now imagine what you feel like when you are simply doing a mundane task such as washing clothes or driving where you feel nothing. Imagine feeling like this all of the time. It's hard to ""fit"" in when you are with a group of friends and everybody is happy because your team just won the game but again you feel nothing. Imagine having your girlfriend break up with you whom you love dearly and you feel both sadness and nothing. Imagine attending a funeral of your grandmother and not even shedding a tear because you simply can't feel the emotions anymore. That is what being depressed is like to me. Absolutely no emotions.

Wow...just wow...this is pretty much it. 
"Let me introduce you to the concept of ""the spoons."" I heard about it forever ago and didn't realize how accurate it is until a recent episode... imagine you start the day with a pocket full of spoons. Those spoons represent your mental energy for the day. Some people start the day with 1,000 spoons, some start with 50. Everything you do during the day requires you to give away some spoons. For some, getting out of bed costs one out of a thousand spoons. For others, it's 15 out of 50. And when you're out of spoons, that's it for the day. All you can do is go home and lie in bed. So, being depressed is living in a low-supply, high-demand economy of spoons. "
"Imagine a thick smoke surrounding you, and a pressure, so intense that words cannot describe it, crushing something deep, deep within you. All of the color and warmth draining from the world, and being replaced with an ever-growing darkness. You are drowning in your very being, unable to swim, unable to move at all. You are paralyzed. 

You begin to accept the darkness, the pressure, the smoke. But yet, you see ends to the misery everywhere. You begin to wonder what it would be like to take all of the pills, drink the bleach under the sink, to drive your car into the river, to let yourself fall from the highest building in town.

You think not of what would become of you after the end. You it think of the end itself, and how wonderful and enticing it seems to be.

You submit to the darkness, all the energy sucked from you, leaving you feeling empty. An emptiness that is almost pleasant, but agonizing at the same time. 

When you go to sleep you wonder if you'd wake up again. The thought sounds more and more appealing.

Then, suddenly, a spark appears. It begins to grow and eventually becomes a raging fire, a phoenix rising from the ashes that you once were. A pheonix that consumes the darkness, caging it. But eventually that cage is broken. And the cycle starts anew.

"Imagine a pill bottle with your car key stuck in it, and when you close it and shake the bottle you can hear the car key rattle around but when you open it- it's just stuck. You have to leave in 5 minutes and you can't find the spare car key anywhere even though you swore it was in the same spot it has always been in. And you just keep trying and trying and trying and those 5 minutes last forever. And every so often you'll start to get the key to come out of the bottle just a little bit and you're so happy and elated. And sometimes you can even get the key out of the bottle. But somehow, it always winds up back in the bottle. And your time to leave just keeps ticking down. Tick tick tick. Everything goes to hell if you don't get the key out of the bottle and leave right now. And now imagine you feel like this for years, and feel so useless because you can't get that key out of the bottle forever because it keeps winding up in there and you keep having to leave when it happens. You start thinking you're a piece of shit, look how worthless you are- you can't even get a key out of a bottle. And then it might go away because you got it out for a minute, but boom- there it is back there. And you have to leave. Now. Tick tick tick. Rattle rattle rattle. But it just won't, you try and try and try and it just won't and you're such a piece of shit you're so worthless...oh there it goes...nope never mind...

That's how it feels."
"I have to force myself to do simple daily tasks. Even typing this message out took me staring at the empty comment space for a couple minutes before I could type a single word. That's also mixed with the stress and anxiety of thinking 'no one cares what I post or say so why bother'. For me it's longing to go out and do things I want to do, but I cannot because myself is also holding me back. "
"""What am I supposed to do

"I went through a mild depression a couple years back, so take this with a grain of salt.

Nothing. You feel nothing. You don't want to die; rather, you want to have never existed at all."
"I reckon it's different for everyone, but I think for me (I probably have a less severe type of depression) I need to be constantly distracted by stuff - my homework, friends, bad drivers cutting me off and not signalling - in order to not think about how pointless everything is. When I'm distracted, I can think about the thing I'm being distracted by; but I guess when I'm alone with my thoughts they just eat away at me."
"Ever sat on the shoreline staring at the ocean?

It just keeps going and going and going. And it’s bleak and terrifying. But you know, somewhere out there there’s something really fucking amazing. Then you remember you’re never gonna move off that shoreline to find it. 

And you realize how big the ocean is. And everything seems so empty. You feel terribly alone and isolated sitting there, seeing all that amazing expanse of wonder crashing in front of you. 

You’re tiny and insignificant, compared to everything you’re looking at, so why does any of it matter? 

Why not just sit there, and feel alone. Sometimes you want to throw yourself in, let it drag you down to the depths. Other times you’d really like to find the motivation to explore, but why bother? It’s all been done by someone else that’s better than you any way.

Bipolar depression can be such a huge pain in the ass especially. "
"It's like waking up in the day and deciding what you have to do. 
Is it worth it to go to work today, it's cold outside and you don't feel like going out early to start your car, but if you do that you can have a cigarette. Or maybe you should just wait until you're in the car, that's easier, less wind.
There's three or four weeks worth of dishes in the sink. Old peanut butter knives are molding, it stinks. But that's a lot of work, and the dish rack you have is very small. Perhaps you'll do them when you can get the stove cleared off to have more space to dry dishes.
But this bed is so warm. And your dreams were so nice. And you feel tired for once, so you should probably sleep anyways. As you appear to just be full of insomnia and migraines the rest of the day.
Oh... your sister messaged you about your dad. He hasn't talked to you in months, and last time you two spoke it was an argument. He's constantly telling you you're worthless and don't know how to just grown up and be an adult... you just found out you're having a baby step-brother. Your 15 year old sister, had to tell you. And suddenly the unknowing lack of emotions turns into a spiraling cluster of betrayal, and sadness. A sheer conglomeration of emotions that words often struggle to describe because you're not sure anymore. You don't understand. You don't believe it. Where's the closest corner? Can you hide? You're home alone in your little apartment and all you want to do is hide. 

I could probably go on longer than this. But I think it's a fairly good idea. Let it be known my depression is coupled with anxiety and hypomanic tendencies, so things are probably different for everyone. "
"There's not really one catch all for depression. For me it was not being able to do anything at all. Being in bed for so long my back hurt, not getting out for anything, putting on a shirt when food got delivered and then straight back to bed. 

Nothing brings any joy, nothing is enjoyable, nothing is fun. The things I loved to do: raiding in WoW, going out for good food, travelling, reading... All became worthless.

I was also constantly tired, couldn't focus, couldn't see how anything would ever be worth anything again.

I tried about 8 different medications, and tried cognitive behavioural therapy and some other stuff, nothing helped. Eventually I started Affect Phobia Therapy which helped a ton. And I know it sucks but the thing that helped most was WANTING to get better. Therapy isn't someone telling you what to do to get better, it's figuring out how you feel, or feel nothing, and why. From there on out its exploring ways to accept it, transform it, use it.

At least that's how it was for me. Everybody's different. But for everyone who is suffering: Talk. Talk to friends, family, yourself, people online. Try rubber duck troubleshooting if you're too afraid to talk to others.

And moet importantly, find professional help. What you feel is real, it's not made up, there's no shame in it and there's tons of others who feel the same. There's help available and it REALLY helps. Feel free to PM me."

"Being completely disinterested in anything because it feels like nothing matters. You know that it should matter, which sometimes makes you feel worse. You get stuck in an endless circle of thinking that if you tried doing something that you used to enjoy, then maybe you’ll feel something. However, the actual act of doing anything is exhausting so you either don’t do it, or if you do, you realize that you put in all of that extra effort for nothing because nothing changes. I have a lot of anxiety that comes with my depression, which fuels the fire.

Also feeling like there’s a constant fogginess, or haziness, in your brain and around you. "

"Not me, but a close friend of mine since high school who always seemed happy-go-lucky and ""innocent"" had a rare breakdown while we were driving back from playing basketball.

He said that some time during high school, his brain started malfunctioning and the people around him started looking more and more like walking trees. 

I hugged him and cried, and I never judge people with depression after that. What I got from him is that depression isn't just the morning blues or I bombed my exam, or I'll feel better after I work out and release some dopamine. It's far worse and far more permanent than that.

We live in different states now with different time zones, but I'm gonna text him after work to ask how he's doing. Thanks for reminding me to do that through the thread, OP."
"Terrible, I kinda feel like I always have this sense of dread or mourning but I don’t know what I’m morning. I also feel like the world is grey and I hardly see any glimpses of color, the good news though is that I’m currently being treated for it and found a good therapist"
"As time goes on its harder for me to relive accurately but I'll do my best.

Imagine if you could not be happy with anything. If no one actually loved you, they just tolerated you and probably hate you inside. If the only reason someone would spend time with you is out of pity. No matter what you do you are worthless because someone can either do it better or can do it without being as irritating as you. The best thing you can do is kill yourself so that people stop having to deal with the garbage you are. 

No one loves you and no one ever will. If this wasnt the case things would be different. But they're not. If you knew how to fix it you would, but you don't. If it wasn't what you deserve someone would save you. But no one is coming. These become your truths. You are incapable of believing anything else and no matter how many times you hear otherwise it's just lies to you. The truth is in your head but that's all you hear. 

These thoughts were all I had for 10 years. Every minute of every day. There wasn't a second of those years that I didn't want to kill myself. I lashed out at others and myself and eventually attempted suicide but was thwarted by a dud round in my gun. I still have it. 

It took another year after that to feel something else. I felt neutral, relapsed for a week, then happiness ever since and it feels so fucking good. I can do anything now. No one saved me. Not meds or therapy.

 I had to realize the truth myself. That was what triggered the change. I saw that my core beliefs were bullshit and just the illness talking and that I needed a restart. I began doing what I wanted, not what would make me liked. The result was that I became happy and even more liked. I have friends who would die for me, people who love me more than anything, and earned everything I need. People like me like they always have. I just needed to learn see it and realize that I don't need to understand it. I'm myself and people love me for it. That's all I need now. Maybe it's what you need too. "
"The fact that people could put up descriptions of how they feel indicates a chance for hope. I am so happy for them.

"I smile a lot every day, but I rarely feel happy or sad. Other than this constant stomach pain caused by anxiety, there's nothing. Sometimes I cry unexpectedly, just a few tears rolling down, but there's often no reason to it, no sadness, no happiness. Nothing really gives me motivation to go ahead and do something, I do everything just because I have to, but in the end the only thing I want is to lay down and just sit there for as long as I can. 
I have people trying to wake me, telling me to move and to fight, to be strong.. etc.. Nothing touches me, nothing goes to the heart or to my mind. I just listen to people and what they have to say, and then return in my bubble. I often want to be alone, but not really. Is so difficult to explain. 
People around me don't understand what I am going through, and I don't even try to explain, I just smile and help and laugh and try my best not to be totally numb towards my loved ones. I won't even try to explain them my feelings because they will think I am just dramatic. 
In the end you learn to live with it,I guess.  
I haven't felt really happy from years, I have no idea how it feels anymore. Every day is the same for me, no extra emotions than the ""standard"" ones.  "

"Sometimes I just want to cry till I can’t anymore, and I couldn’t tell you why. Lots of self doubt, self hate, misery. When I was at my lowest, last year, I probably thought about different ways to kill myself once every few hours. 

For me, it feels like a room keeps filling up with water, and I don’t realize it till I’m struggling to stay above it. Then I’m submerged. Eventually, the water goes away, but you know it’s coming back."

I think a common misconception is that everything sucks when you have depression. It’s an illness that you can get s handle on almost like a little dude in your head that you have to control and keep pleases at the same time 

But Depression (obviously) effects everyone differently.

"What is feel?

When I'm in a deep depression, I don't feel anything, the world just goes on around me and it's like I'm disconnected from reality."
"Depression hits people differently. I've gone through fairly severe depression in the past but I've never been suicidal, always knowing there would be a brighter day. Most if not all of what people have written here is probably from their own experience. Many resonate with me, some don't. While I am much healthier now, I still have days where I have a complete lack of motivation to do anything beyond getting up. Even that can be difficult. I'm not sad, I simply feel like part of me is missing. I get nothing productive done which only serves to make me feel worse for it. The normal response of a reward for being productive does zero to motivate me. I simply don't care. Imagine going through life where you don't get to experience the fullness of anything. Everything is muted, lackluster, distant, etc. I have some good days and some not so good.

Not sure if your question is for self diagnosis or simply curiosity for something you've never experienced. I can look back now and see that I suffered from depression for probably 25 years before I was diagnosed. Because I didn't know what to look for, I adamantly ""knew"" I didn't have it. Now I know what to look for in my behavior so if I see myself heading down that road again, I can take steps to minimize my depression."
Listen to Julien Baker's album Turn out the Lights and you'll know
"0 motivation to do ANYTHING. Sometimes I think about what I want to do once I inevitably have to get out of bed and the house and it just feels like none of it is even remotely possible, I'll never be able to do anything. If I was given the opportunity to erase myself from existence I'd do it in a heartbeat."
"For me it’s like having this shadow walk around with me everywhere I go, muttering heart-wrenching things to me. No matter what is going on around me, or how happy things are, the shadow says these things. 

Fortunately I have been doing really well the past couple of years and the shadow has morphed into a happy rainbow :) it’s like the difference between Te-Ka and Te-Fiti in Moana. "
Depressing
"Depression is like swimming out to sea, being caught in a wave, and ending up on a deserted island.  Except this island isn't in the middle of nowhere.  You don't see empty water all around you.  This is worse.  You're a few hundred feet away from the mainland - too far to know you can swim back safely, but close enough that you can make out everyone standing on the beach.

The island doesn't have much food on it.  There's really nothing to do on it.  The longer you are there, the weaker and more bored you feel yourself becoming.  But none of that really matters.  Not really.  You're not sure you even really notice.  The only thing you can think about is how you're trapped on this island instead of being on the beach with everyone else.

The strangest thing is the sky on the island is always gray and looks like it's going to rain, but there are always people happily playing on the beach.  Even stranger, your friends are among them and they can see you.  You shout to them, and they just wave.  They ask why you're over on that island and not on the beach.  Any attempt to tell them is drowned out by the sounds of the waves, so they just say, ""Hey, why don't you swim back over and join us?""

And you try.  You decide just to swim back.  It's not *that* far.  How hard could it be?  You make it about halfway before you tire out and the tide pushes you back to the island.  You try again and again, sometimes getting even closer, only to run of energy and find yourself back at the island. 
So, you figure, a boat!  Building a boat with ores or a sail could get you back to the beach.  

Every day, you wake up and gather supplies.  You find some driftwood.  You shake palm tries, attempting to get some fronds to come loose.  You see if you can find something that would work as a sail.  And each afternoon, you sit down and try to put things together (not really knowing what you're doing) while watching the people on the beach.  You look for your friends.  They no longer play as close to the shore as they used to, so they're not as easy to spot.  You wave.  A couple notice and wave back.  You try to draw attention to what you're doing, but they don't see it.  They don't ask you to swim back anymore.

One day, you hear some sounds coming from the other side of the island.  You haven't really explored over there before, so you wander over to see what it is.  It's people!  There are people on your island.  You explain to them how long you've been here and that you can't get back.  One of them nods and say, ""Yes, I've been here for two hours.  It's awful.  Have you tried swimming back to the beach?  That always works for me."" And some do just that.  You watch them carefully, trying to see if there's some different way they're swimming.  You do your best to copy them, but they make it back to the beach while you drift back to the island once again.  Some stay on the island for a long time, but it seems like they all eventually make it back to the beach, leaving you behind.

You destroy your boat out of frustration.

Now, you sit on the shore, like you did in those early days.  Just watching.  You can't even see your friends anymore.  They might not even be there.  Maybe they got tired of seeing you here, not understanding why you won't come back.  You start to wonder if you're just weaker than everyone else.  That would explain why they can swim back from the island and you can't.  You must be dumber than them too, because you're the only one who has been stupid enough to get trapped here.  You wonder if maybe you should stop wasting energy trying to get back to the beach and just get comfortable here.

And perhaps that's what you end up doing.  You wouldn't be the first to stay on an island like this one.  Or perhaps one day you see a small fire on the island.  Maybe you were reckless and forgot to put out the campfire, maybe you decided to burn the island down once and for all, or maybe you did it with the intention of alerting someone.  In any case, someone comes on a small boat to put the fire out.  You eye the boat and it occurs to you that you can try something you've never thought to do before:  You can ask for help off the island.

Unfortunately, it's not that simple.  ""Sorry,"" the man says.  ""My boat can only fit one.  There's no way for me to carry you back to shore.

""But...,"" he says, ""I do have tools.  I do know how to build another boat like mine.  I can bring them back if you'd like. It might take a while, but if you follow my instructions, we can build it together.""

So, that's what you do.  You slowly construct a boat again, this time with help.  It's harder than you expected, even harder than when you were doing it on your own, but it has to be.  This boat is going to be sturdy enough to ensure it takes you all the way back.  Some days you get a lot done.  Others, not so much.  But you know you have to keep working on this boat and it will get done.  Because you aren't dumb.  You aren't weak.  No one could've lived on this island as long as you have if they were."
"You want to want things but just can’t. Even if you’re able to push yourself towards something, you somehow convince yourself that it’s pointless. Sometimes you’ll wanna smash your head through a window and you won’t necessarily be okay with it, but you can accept the consequences. When you realize you have that thought, it scares you deeper into this feeling rather than scaring you out, which only makes you feel worse. Maybe your mind isn’t constantly spiraling downwards and maybe you’ll have a good day, but at any moment for no reason at all your mindset could return to the depression and you won’t even remember the feeling of not being depressed.


I used to be a generally positive person and bad things in my life wouldn’t normally affect me, but then my depression hit and suddenly I couldn’t even comprehend happiness. Luckily it isn’t constant for me and the feeling usually only occurs for a few weeks at a time, but I tend to notice when it’s starting and my mindset only goes downhill from there.


If you haven’t seen “Inside Out”, I definitely recommend it for the way it shows the concept of depression in a kids movie. "
"It's like knowing you're going to be here for a while, but not being able to fully enjoy life as much as others..  Just knowing you're going to be alone forever makes things much more difficult.  I've half accepted it already, but it still hurts.  "
"When you only do stuff to please other people, but nothing for yourself, because nothing would make you happy."
"Being trapped not knowing what the meaning of anything is. Not finding your self worth and making other people happy before your own happiness. Being able to have a fake personality in having people think they really know who you are. Lying just to get through the next day. Waiting for the day to come where you don’t have to worry about a single thing anymore. Feel selfish you have to talk to people to comfort your own mind. 

Depression fucking blows"
I just slept for 14 hours and then a half hour later I slept another 3. 
Not only do you feel like shit but you're so lazy you can't fucking move and you hate life and yourself
"The demo lyrics of They Might Be Giants' *Four of Two*. Not the official release, which is a kids' song in the vein of Rip Van Winkle, but the demo version, which is about sitting in a chair trying to make yourself get up and eventually strangling yourself in an attempt at breaking the monotony.

""But I still hadn't moved
And I looked at the clock
And it still said four of two"""
"To have depression is to feel like you've been shortchanged by life. To see people enjoy their jobs, enjoy socializing, enjoy having places to be and things to do but not being able to enjoy those same things. It's the feeling of ""I don't deserve this"" whenever something good happens and the feeling of ""it never ends"" when something bad happens.  It's the self loathing you feel when you've done NOTHING for a week because you have no willpower to try to live a productive life. It's the distraught you feel because for some reason, you randomly wake up without your emotions some days and you're horrified they won't return or that you'll act out without them and do something stupid. 

But worst of all, it's the constant fear. The fear that despite your best efforts, you WILL fall. The fear that the progress you make to fix yourself will quite possibly fail and you'll be back in your slump. Back to square one. Over and over. A monotonous cycle of failing to just be a normal human being. 

Some people commit suicide to end that cycle. Some people find comfort in that cycle and eventually resign themselves to never trying to break it. Some people are successful at breaking out of it, but even then it will always haunt them. 

I tend to find comfort in my cycle of failure. But I'm fighting it. This is the best I've ever done, so it's definitely progress but that fear of failure will always be with me. "
"The best way I can describe it is: 

Imagine all the things you love doing, like absolutely love. Things that without fail can always bring you joy and happiness, things like seeing your dog when you come home, a nice cup of tea and relaxing in bed, gaming, your favorite movie, seeing your SO. Imagine that and knowing it should make you happy but feeling nothing instead. And the fact that you feel nothing makes you wish you could be sad but you can't even feel that. Then you feel inhuman and wonder what's wrong with you. All the while you're losing all motivation to do anything at all because you can feel literally no happiness, no sadness, no nothing at all no matter what you do. You can't even build up the strength to get out of the bed anymore, doing anything becomes a chore, you forget to eat, drink, bathe, take care of yourself at all. The thought that it will pass doesn't even cross your mind because at that time your perception of the world has shrunk due to your inability to feel or comprehend emotion. 

The people around you can't understand how you feel and you can't accurately explain or describe it either. These people leave you because they can't help you and it's just become too much of an emotional burden on them.

You know you want help and you know you want it to stop but you just can't find a way. You begin to wonder why anything's worth it at all and why you should even continue living at this point. You're not human, you don't feel, you'll never be happy. 

All you can do is wait and hope it passes, move on to the next day, hope maybe one day there'll be a breakthrough in therapy, maybe the meds will start working.

It's not a good feeling, it's not something I'd wish on my worst enemy. It's something I think needs to be taken more seriously and I really hate nowadays that a lot of people pretend/mis-identify depression and think it just means you feel really sad. Being depressed and having depression are two very different things and it really ruins lives..."
It doesn't.
"It can be an overwhelming sensation of being numb and uncaring. It isn't because you want to feel that way, it is just there, and there is a never ending feeling of being stuck. It isn't necesarily a feeling of sadness, it can be a feeling of just nothing being there, like being stuck in an emotionless black hole, nothing in it, and no sense of what is wrong. At times it feels like a chore to even feel, so it is easier just not to feel anything. It is the sensation of everything being so bland, that you can't be bothered, sometimes spiced up by extreme emotions. It is only the extremes that surface, everything else is just not distinct enough to show. Usually it is only the extremely dark and negative emotions that surface, the rest of the time it is a greyish beige nothingness, with nothing being able to bring more than fleeting moments of happiness or joy."
"everyone sees depression in their own way, just like how the latter is different for everyone.

for me, i am a weird and peculiar person. i like making people happy, despite feeling awful myself. i dont feel comfortable telling people about my depression. it makes me feel guilty because i don't want to be a huge burden

i feel like depression is like a ghost that follows you around. you can't see it, you can't touch it. but you know deep down, no matter how much smiles and laughs you put up, its still behind you. you deny your sad and maybe that you're not depressed, but its still there. you try to say that your fine but it's still there. you just try to deny it so much because you just don't want to realise how unhappy you are because you know what will happen if you do. 

no matter what you try to do, the depression ""ghost"" is still there and it seems like you cant make it go away. it's just waiting for you to turn around. that's when it appears and haunts you with the feelings of worthlessness and guilt when you sleep at night. the ""why do you even bother?"" feeling when you wake up. it sucks all the life and motivation outta you to the point maybe being a ghost isn't too bad at all.. and when i mean ""being a ghost"", i mean contemplating suicide. at least you don't need to deal with this stuff anymore, right? 

and then, its its the same cycle again: denial, realisation, depression"
"It doesn't really feel like much at times. Sometimes it's a crushing weight, sometimes it's not caring about anything at all. Most times it's wanting to just disappear or sleep it away.

Numb, meh and painfully frustrating (because you can often consciously be aware of what's going on, but not being able to do anything about it). The despair I feel sometimes is overwhelming, then I get into a feedback loop and beat up on myself, making myself feel worse and perpetuating the problem. So that's fun, too.

I prefer to hide away because it's very exhausting to put on the mask and interact/deal with people. I'd rather just not bother. Then you get people who don't understand, whether they claim to or not, and end up saying really fucking hurtful things to you showing their sheer ignorance and lack of empathy. That sucks, too."
Why wade upstream to die when you could just lay down and achieve the same thing?
"Feeling alone when you're surrounded by people, laughing and smiling when there's nothing to laugh about. Wishing you could just sleep for hours as it was the only way to escape the anguish. Again not wanting to die, but just a small respite. I would get unimaginable headaches that manifested as if something was trying to burst out of my head, other times it would be gut twisting pain. As one got worse I would hope for the other and vice versa. I'm definitely better now but know it could return at any time."
"Imagine being in the middle of a bonfire, with the flames roaring and surrounding you. But instead of intense burning it’s just a dull, but ever loudening suffering. A smothering. It drains color, energy, and emotions. And outside the bonfire all your friends and loved ones are standing, shouting encouragement and support at you. But you can’t hear them over the bonfire. And standing next to you is darkness, offering a way out. "
"Not great, bob."
"Have you ever had a nice hot relaxing bath only for it to turn ice cold and you're stuck in there and can't move?   
That's what depression feels like, you'll be going along feeling good about youself only to realize that happiness is temporary and you will be brought back to the painstaking realization that anything and everything you do can't get rid of this black cloud hovering above you."

"Cold and dark. All I do all day is think about how terrible and awful and fucked up and pathetic I am. I feel so fucking low, and anytime I try to tell everyone I feel like a cliche. Like because I realize my problems, they’re devalued. The few people I’ve managed to tell just give me useless advice or say stuff that doesn’t help, and I feel like I’m a burden or like they think I’m just after attention. 

But the worst part is probably how alone I feel. Every single relationship (family/friends/romantic), I know logically that people love me, but I feel like no one likes me. The cute girl that you work with? Yea. She probably thinks you’re a pathetic loser for even thinking of talking to her. Your best friend who says he is always there for you? He’s just saying that to be a good friend. He doesn’t want to listen to your problems. 

All I wanna do is be happy but I know that everything I do is pointless. "
"You kind of feel trapped. Like everything you do, you have a ball and chain around your ankles and you have to work with it. It weighs down on you, making the simplest of tasks hard. Then a lot of the time it is just overwhelming because it's not just the ball and chain, it's handcuffs, it's being constantly told ""You can't do ____, so why even try?""  When you try to muster the strength to do something, it's any hindrance you can really imagine that stops you from progressing or achieving things you want to do. Some days, it feels like less to deal with others, but there's always something holding you back. "
It feels like your worst fears are too good to even bother you
"It feels like being at the station and standing on the platform whilst everybody else is boarding the train, except you. You don't know how and are completely unable to climb on with everyone. So you watch the train depart, then you wait for the next one. This feeling is constant."
Horrible and life changing
"I get chronic Dissociation and Derealization, I’m not sure if it’s because of Depression or so, but it makes me feel like I’m seeing myself and my life from an outer perspective, all my memories are not from my perspective, everything is hazy and blurry and it all feels fake, maybe because I don’t want to be in my body and I don’t want to live my life and my memories. But I wake up each morning I don’t know who the person in the mirror is because I don’t want to. "
Like you're hungry but nothing sounds good. 
"Like finding this post, the post has over 300 comments, and you can relate to every single one, all worded or thought differently. It all resonates to the same."
"You don't want to get up in the morning, but you don't want to sit there.

Check that, you just don't want. There's no true desire or plan. It's just a looming sadness and emptiness.

It speaks to me. It tells me not to worry. It tells me that just one noose is all it takes. It tells me that it's all for the better, that no one's going to miss me.

I try not to listen to it, but *damn*, it's so hard to ignore."
"For me, it feels like heaviness. Like a weight is on my chest. Then it is coupled with a pit in my stomach and not sleeping well. "
"Fucking awful! And I still have it. I have advanced to the better stage of it. I understand I will always have it, and know how to deal with it. I understand things I could do to better it, but I choose not to do them because I am depressed. Everyday is a fucking baby step and it sucks hardcore. Surrounding myself with people with good mindsets makes a million years difference. Also self-discipline has helped as well. I am an artistic spirit and will wallow in my angst for days and weeks if undisturbed. I have to force myself into life in order to break the depression, but it will return in cycles. It is like bracing a boat for a wave at sea. 

I want to edit that it WILL get better. I have suffered from deep depression from 11 years old to 31 years old. I have been an adult crying like an infant in bed because I am paralyzed with emotion and anxiety. I have had substance abuse, social, stomach, etc. problems. But there is always an end. You have to tap into that inner strength. YOU ARE WORTH IT, DON'T GIVE UP. Fuck, I tried to and I'm so glad I didn't. Multiple times.

You realize every year you get is a a fuckin opportunity to make it better. You can turn your entire life around in a matter of months. I'm not kidding. Work out. Join a club. Change jobs. Move. Surround yourself with different friends. See a therapist. Change your inner monologue. Try everything you can do  before you lose hope.

I have lost so many friends last year and it is truly heartbreaking. "
"Feels bad, man"
"Hyperbole and a Half has a great explanation.

Everything just takes more effort. You have to struggle to get out of bed and struggle to be motivated for anything. You switch from feeling so much pain to feeling absolutely nothing.
"Everything you loved doing and talking about and looking at and listening to no longer becomes important to you. I had a passion for the film industry, but it got to the point that every thing I saw on the screen started to look the same, I might as well would have seen a Fast & Furious movie on repeat. You start to feel like you've already felt all there is to feel in life, and having any of those feelings again would only result in diminishing returns. Any little thing that anyone does can count as a personal attack on you. If you saw your best friend talking to someone some other buddy of his, you begin to hate yourself and the phrase ""you are and will never be enough"" will recur I  your head. You're existence starts to be a burden on the lives of others and you see no right to be alive. You've accomplished nothing, you have nothing, you are nothing. "
"""You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you’ll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no . . . anything. There’s no chance at all of recovery. You’ll just — exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever . . . lost."" -J.K. Rowling 

It's being dead while haunted, yourself. A ceaseless sorrow encompassing and taking meaning away every thought and sentiment. You think of your loved ones and you know they would be better off without you. 

You fight the negative thoughts, like someone drowning in a raging sea, getting breaths of air when you can. But sometimes a big wave comes and you run out of energy and star to sink. 

Frustration begets outbursts begets isolation begets frustration. It's like a cancer that eats away at your inner self, leaving only what outer casing you can craft for the strangers on the outside. That smiling clerk chatting you up about your favorite author in the used book store, hands you back your stamp card and says something funny that makes you chuckle to yourself. Later that night you repeat that funny comment to a loved one while meanwhile that same clerks sits alone in a dark room across town self harming where you'll never see, because they can't speak to anyone they are comfortable around without being negative, because that is all they feel on the inside and you can't keep it all inside forever. 

You become a philosophical zombie, a thought experiment gone awry, an entity sustaining itself on pain. Then for a moment you return... fighting your way to the surface, to get another breath of air, before the next big wave comes along. "
"For me, it's feeling like shit and sometimes just being sad for days or weeks at a time. If I had seen this a year ago, I would have said that it isn't that bad. They say it gets better, but it's only gotten worse. I'm at a point where I don't want to live. It's just so pointless. I spend my days in bed just browsing the internet because I dropped out of school. I just feel like there's no point in school if I'm just gonna die soon anyway.

TL;DR

It feels shit. Sorry for the rant."
Very muted.
Like swimming in dark water and you can’t seem to get out. 
"You feel like you should be sad, but you're not. You feel like you should do something, but you really, really can't be bothered.

Those things you usually like to do? Yeah, let's not do them, what's the point? Important tasks need doing? They don't matter.

You know you'll feel worse later, right? Yeah, that's fine. I'm not anxious now, but I know I will be later. 

Girlfriend trying to cheer you up? Just lay in bed and be petulant, drive her away, she doesn't understand or appreciate how hard you have to try to be even functional at this level.

And none of it matters. Just stare at the ceiling. "
"It's an emotional rollercoaster. What really gets me is the lack of motivation to even do the simplest tasks in my daily routine like getting out of bed, going to the bathroom until I have to run for it, making my own food, being completely apathetic to my studies or my work. It used to last for months and years but today I've learned how to live by it and learned how to behave and live with it. I never live in sadness, depression is not about being sad (for those who believe it is), it is about having a very bleak view of everything you do.  

Oh, and there's anxiety. Fuck anxiety and panic attacks. It would be much better without those. "
"A lot like not being depressed I imagine, if you take away the nice feelings. Times when you'd be feeling good, there's nothing. Times when you'd have good and bad feelings, there's just bad. Times when you would be feeling bad, generally are just worse than the rest. People say ""a good shower makes you feel good!"", ""do some exercise, that releases endorphins and helps combat depression"". Guess what a shower feels like without the good feeling? That's right, getting wet, getting dry and wasting time that could be better spent distracting you from life. Guess what exercise feels like without the good feelings? Standing there mentally exhausted, and adding physical exertion on top - and don't forget wasting time that  could be better spent distracting you from life.

You start to consider the days where you haven't considered getting drunk or harming yourself as days you ""feel good"". Days where you don't feel anything, wow, they ""feel great""!

If you're lucky enough to not always be depressed, it even seeps into those times, causing you to have a little voice in the back of your mind constantly reminding you that this is only a phase, that *something* will happen *some time* which will take away the fakeness that is feeling good. It always does.

Time becomes this amorphous, slippery, sticky fluid you seem to flow through at an uneven and non euclidian rate. Last year happened a week ago, yesterday was decades ago, next week is too far away, but having to figure out what people want for next Christmas is looming.

Obligations add up to cease your ability to focus, interactions with people are a minefield of embarrassments best avoided so as not to be reminded why everybody you know would be far better off without you in their life, even if they are too stupid to realise it (and then - oh god... you just called everyone you know stupid in your thought? How *fucking* hypocritical is that? You think you're better than them? What gives a piece of shit like you that right?).

You thought you were good at something? You notice all the ways you're bad at it. You also notice *every* time you stop getting better at something. Any and all ""improvements"" come only in the smallest sizes, and then you screw something up royally to prove that you really aren't capable of this after all, now you just look like an idiot trying to play at being clever.

It just makes so much sense that you might just become angry that you don't even have it in you to kill yourself, you can't even accomplish that, not only do you suck at life, you suck at even fixing the problem, at ending it, because you can't bring yourself to care enough for yourself that you can ignore how it would affect others in your life (yes, that's a contradiction. If you could out-logic depression then therapists would be out of a job)."
Like wading through waist high molasses in a maze of distorting mirrors.
"You just feel really drained and you are mentally suffering. Think of the time when you felt really anxious/sad, like it's just not your day. Maybe something went wrong, and it's hard for you to get over. It's like that but with even more depressing thoughts coming into your mind. 

Now imagine that deep, negative state of mind. With depression you have many episodes of this state of mind. MANY. Some people have it so bad that they even forget how happiness feels like.  

While in this state you have a hard time reaching that feeling of happiness,"
"An empty void. Everything you need to do is like wading through a vat of treacle, even thinking or making a small decision takes so much energy it's not worth doing. Staying in bed and watching crap on tv - no point watching anything you used to like because there's just no joy in the world anymore. Ordering junk food online because the sugar/carb rush gives you a moment of non-void that almost seems like joy because it's so opposite to how you currently feel."
"For me it’s not numbness. I feel far too much, far too easily. Any little thing someone says to me that is upsetting impacts me so badly. It’s literally like I’m gasping for air and my chest burns so much. The same goes when I think of something that I’ve done or do something  to someone that upsets them or fucks things up. Even if it’s only something small that they claim not to care about it’s like I can’t let go and I’m consumed with guilt. 
My head feels heavy all the time. Sometimes something “good” in my life may happen and the heaviness goes away.. but it’s only temporary relief. It comes back. 
Part of me just wants to die and leave this earth. Another part of me wants to live so badly. For me depression is an everyday constant battle between these thoughts. "
It’s like being stuffed with cotton wool. Everything is fuzzy and dull and when you move the wool rubs against itself and makes that horrible squeak so you just stay in one place and hope the wool shifts because you know if you could just get moving you might manage to make the wool fall out and things would be bette 
"Depression is the worst;






To explain it takes more than a breath.







You feel so dark you might burst,






like the blackest of hollow depths.









Hopelessness, fear and being tired








are some of the thing you'd feel.








But you keep a happy face so to be admired,









but inside...you just won't heal.










Imagine your interests no longer fancy,








So heavy are your heart and mind.








You no longer feel upbeat or dance-y,









and you cannot seem to unwind.









Nothing brings enjoyment,








and you'd rather be all alone.









Your job becomes employment;










merely work, and it ways a ton.







Some folks have anxiety, 








while others simply are quiet.









Their smiles don't reach their eyes;








You can note, and you can spy it.








All darkest thoughts and fears arise











Out of the depths and gloom.







Nothing bright is found in your eyes;










In your heart, there is only doom.









Depression is a monster,









I silent killer in life.








A shame that so many suffer;









they continue to live in strife."

"Like there is a ceiling in my brain. When I had depression I was under the ceiling with no way of breaking through it back to ""normality."" I don't have depression any more so it's like (in my brain) I'm standing on top of the ceiling now breathing fresh air. The ceiling underneath, which I guess now is a floor beneath me, could break but as the years go by I feel it become sturdier."

"Every individual experiences it differently, so YMMV.

In my experience, it's been an overall feeling of emptiness. It's not a feeling of deep sadness all the time: it's more like feeling nothing at all. 

It's not that I feel sad, it's that I'm unable to remember what feeling happy is like. I lose the desire to do things I used to enjoy because I can't remember how good they used to make me feel. In a bout of depression, these activities don't make me happy or sad- they don't make me feel anything at all. And if they won't make me feel anything at all, why bother doing them?

I don't self-harm, but I know people who do. They've often described to me thusly: they don't harm themselves because they *like* pain nor because they *want attention.* Pain still hurts. They harm because, despite the pain, at least they can feel *something* "
"Reading this thread has made me, well, depressed I guess. I only made the discovery of having anxiety for all of my life when I started therapy last year, which I went through due to what I would say is mild depression compared to some of the poor folks in here.

I just want to say that to everyone who has posted their experience, you are actually worth MORE in my eyes having experienced this truely awful thing. I hope you all can find some peace. "
Your highs are always held back and to can never be as happy as anybody near. All you wanna do is go home and when your home all you wanna do is go out.
Bad

"Full of emptiness. 

That's what I feel like right now. 

It can be different, but, at this very moment, I feel like I'm coming apart at the badly-repaired seams because I'm overstuffed with nothing. 

Earlier, it was 'I wish to fill time. I shall play a game I enjoy,' followed by listless playing and the despair that comes with 'I don't enjoy this.'

"This is one I've only recently noticed, but when it's really bad there is a fuzzy body sensation. These are always hard to describe but it's somewhere in the middle of when your leg falls asleep, when you've drank too much alcohol, or when you're embarrassed, but without any heat and more in the chest instead of in the face.

If being overjoyed is like having butterflies in your stomach, this would be like blowing out a vacuum canister into your stomach."
"Imagine long periods of a constant bone-deep tiredness that leaves you with no energy or interest in doing much of anything. Now sprinkle in an occasional spike of physically painful unendurable grief that can show up with little or no discernible reason. I'm talking about the kind of sorrow that brings tears and leaves you balling up to try to get away from it. 


.


The world you live in seems physically less bright, less colorful, and the spots of brightness and color just serve to highlight how everything else is more muted by comparison. You want to be happy. Hell, you want to want to be happy. But you don't have the energy to pursue it as a goal. So you lay in bed a little longer each morning or you take a few more naps in the afternoons that last until morning - because the warmth and floaty numbness of that place between sleeping and being awake is nice. In a way that other things just aren't.

And you wake up one morning and realize that another six months have gone by without anything to show for it. "

"The book analogy is a great one, but if you're depressed and someone asks you how it feels, there's a great video [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc) called 'The Black Dog' that really sums it up in a simple way for someone who just doesn't get it."
"I’m currently feeling depression for the first time in my life, I have always been someone who can make anyone smile or laugh because of my positive attitude. But now, I don’t leave my room. At times when I would go do things with friends, I want to so badly. I so badly need to go and need to find happiness, but I can’t. I can’t look people in the eyes anymore in fear that they’ll notice my uncontrollable sadness"

Apathy. Intense apathy.
For me it feels like carrying a weight around 24/7/365.  There's a 30-40 lb weight on my shoulder that I can't get rid of.  So you move slower and you're worn out and after it while it feels like it's not even worth it.

"I don't know if I have exactly depression, since I never got any help with it, but I know I have some isolation tendency.

I can't express everything I feel, but I can tell you it's uncontrollable. I feel that people don't like and even don't need me, even if they tell me they do. Some months ago I told my friend: ""I know you love me, but someone inside my head is constantly saying that you don't need me in your days"" and its basically that, I can't just stop. I can't count how many friendship I've lost in all my life because of it, but I accept myself being the ""guilty"" of it and I'm trying to get some psychologial help to deal with my problem."

"When you're not sad but empty like you dony feel anything at all.
You just want to be in one place as you see it your ""safe place"" and you dont have the drive to see another day but you will see it anyway."

Depressing.
Shitty
"Spare time isn't fun, you just want to get over with the day but you can't go to sleep because it's still so early that you'd destroy your sleep pattern, the time moves so slow that you just sit there bored of all. Working and chores exhaust you to no end.

It's like trying to any% speedrun life."
"Imagine you going out with your friends. You have a few beers, talk, laugh and generally have a good time.

You wake up in the morning - slight hangover - and think about the night before. And every time you think about it you recognize something dumb you said, some weird gesture you made, you remember that one frown you got from that one girl, instead of the smiles you got from 5 others. You second guess your deo, your shoes, your shirt,... you even second guess your friends. Did they maybe talk shit about you when they both left for the toilet? Was that smile fake? Was he bored when I talked to him?

And suddenly that great night out manifests as a bad memory you feel ashamed for. It has no more positive feelings connected to it and only serves as another mirror for all your flaws.

Now imagine this happening to all of your activities - everything. Your free-time and your work. In the worst cases *everything* good is erased from a person's mind. Depression is a black void that devours your life's light and leaves only grey and darkness and *numbness* behind. If that point is reached, you better watch out for that person, because there is literally nothing left keeping them from ending it than simple survival instinct - which can be overwritten, eventually."
"[You asked me how depression felt,](http://i.imgur.com/ihTnzCw.jpg)

and this is all I could come up with.



It feels like

I'm walking upstream

through a current strong enough

to pull me under four times over.



There are other, with me 

but they are walking along the banks

telling me to ""just get out of the water.""

But instead of extending a hand in help,

they just move on and leave me behind.



Every once in a while I find a rock

that is strong enough for me to lean on,

And I can rest for  a bit.



But the rocks always get tired of holding me up,

and when they let go, I'm left drowning,

thrown 50ft.. back again.



And nothing is harder

then standing up in that current,

when everything in you

is telling you how much easier things would be

if you just let yourself get dragged under.

"It's different for everyone. For me, with a relatively mild form of depression, my emotions were pretty much turned down until they were barely discernible to me. I couldn't really tell if I was happy, or sad, or angry, or exhausted a lot of the time. 

Allie Brosh (of *Hyperbole and a half*) has a great comic on depression, in which she talks about crying and sadness: 

>I call this emotion ""crying"" and not ""sadness"" because that's all it really was. Just crying for the sake of crying. 

That's what happened to me before I went on anti-depressants. I was crying a lot. I didn't have any particular cause, I'm not even sure I was sad, I was just crying. I had no control over it, and that embarrassed me, which only made it worse.

Therapy helped a lot, as did the anti-depressants. I've been off the meds for over a year and have not had a relapse despite some tough times. So I wouldn't call myself cured - you never know if the depression doesn't come back - but I'm all better now, and I now how to get help if I need it. :)"

"Sometimes it feels like a hole in your chest. Like you'll never be warm again. It can be the hottest day of summer and you're wrapped in a blanket and you still feel so cold. It can feel like nothing will ever go right and you should just stop trying. It can feel like there's nothing, no reason, no point, just nothing. But it can also feel like the happiest day of your life. It can feel like no matter what happens everything will be fine. Depression and anxiety don't always seem to be about being sad or scared. At least for me it's feeling everything so intensely and raw. Most often it's sadness or fear or suicidal thoughts but sometimes waves of joy overcome me and I'm so happy for no reason.

Sometimes these thoughts become too much to bear, and the suicidal thoughts come creeping in. When they start, you'll either take to harming yourself in some physical way (knives and razors were mine) in a desperate attempt to distract yourself from the mental stress; or give in.
Other times, the crippling sadness takes over, and it makes you want to reach out to someone, anyone. But fear holds you back. Fear of judgment from others, or fear of becoming a burden to them - thinking that your pathetic problems aren't worth their time, or that you don't want to ruin their happiness by imposing on them. And when the fear takes over, you'll have nothing left but to cry in silence, hiding yourself away from others. Oftentimes you will literally end up crying yourself to sleep, and wake up feeling miserable or ashamed.


Other days, there's nothing. You feel nothing - no happiness, no sadness, just emptiness. You can't enjoy the things you once loved, nor can you hate the things you once hated. You simply stop caring, and you'll close yourself off from others because you don't care to interact with anyone else. Doesn't matter if you're at work, or at school, or at home, you'll just want to be left alone."
It doesn’t.
"Alternatively, everything you do is 100% dicipline and 0% motivation."
The problem is it doesn’t feel like anything.  It’s the absence of feeling.
It doesn't.
"Glued to the bed when you wake up, because it takes an insurmountable amount of energy just to sit up in bed. And when you go through the day, it feels as though there is a force constantly pressing down on you mentally and physically. Burdened. Suffocating. Tired no matter how much sleep. Feelings are numbed."
"For me it feels like this always present sense of impending doom? I suppose that's a bit of anxiety as well. But things i would normally enjoy stir up nothing at all, and all i think about is the fact that i have to do it again tomorrow. "
For me it just feels like not wanting to do anything since I'm sure it would go bad or not worth my time.
"The fleeting feeling you get after reading some of these apt descriptions. But it stays with you, sometimes making itself more prominent out of nowhere. A feeling that for a non depressed person would disappear with facing the sun and going about your day."
"For me: Constant negative thoughts, often vocalized when you're in private (and sometimes when you forget you aren't in private), along with a huge ""weight"" that makes you move very slowly and sluggishly and spend nearly an hour to force yourself out of bed.

The weird part is that it feels like it becomes part of your personality - and weirdly - some part of you doesn't want to change your personality - it is who you are, after all. Sometimes people ask me why do I look so sad - and I tell them that's just how I look normally. "
"To me, it feels like I’m stuck in a hole and there’s this weight on me that prevents me from climbing out of that hole. There will be times where that weight becomes heavier and my hole gets deeper. No matter how much I cry for help, I’m by myself in this dark hole with this weight pulling me down. Eventually my mental health got better and that weight becomes lighter and lighter. I do have episodes where I slip into that hole again. "
"For me I feel really kind of pathetic.. I start questioning my worth and start doubting my ambitions. Sometimes I am frozen in nervousness and I even get angry at myself like, how dare I think I'm deserving of anything special. I get depressed sometimes in moments that make no sense.. like at an art gallery with a significant other, or at the beach.. or cuddling in bed. It sucks."
"Think of it as a baseline, everybody has a mood they default to, the usually mood is content or neutral. 

Depressed peoples baseline is lower than normal, they don't get sad easily their default is sad, but can be happy and have fun, they just revert back to sad. 

On the other side you have manic which is a higher baseline than normal. So they default to happy, but this can be just as bad depression. "
"i cant describe it myself. but Buffy the vampire slayer can, the song going through the motions from the episode once more with feeling was exactly how i felt. "
"I am suffering with a deep depression right now. I don't want to be dead but if the choice is between being dead and living everyday feeling like shit, I'd rather be dead. I'm unable to work because I can't hold down a job with this depression. I've no money at all not a penny to my name and I can't stand this for much longer. doctors are useless. They just keep prescribing the same shitty tablets that don't work so what do I do. Every morning when I wake up I burst into tears because I'm sick of the same shit day in day out."
"For me personally, all of the worst things I think about myself, and all of the negative outcomes I can think of as reasons why I shouldn't try to accomplish something sound the most sensible and real.

It's taken a long time to realize that some part of my brain is trying to make me not try anything ever and I need to ignore or move around this with good habits, a (sometimes foolishly) optimistic outlook, awareness of the bad thought patterns, a lot of therapy, etc.

FWIW, I've heard it described as a lot like being an addict in recovery. You're never done, you're just working through it and making the best choices you can one day at a time."
Depressing 
"Nothing most of the time, and then far too much every once in a while"
It's like the only feeling you can feel is anger at yourself for not wanting to do anything.
It's kind of like this old friend that keeps holding you back from everything you want to do but you keep letting it happen because hey it's just your old pal right?
"Empty, like I'm an NPC, a shadow, like I'm in third person. It's not sadness or anger a lot of the time, it's being irritable and feeling yourself sink or like you're looking through frosted glass and struggling to catch a breath. 

Procrastination too, I've been meaning to go to the drs to get back on my meds after I stopped taking them, that was over 3 years ago I just... Haven't got round to it

It's not being able to sleep for days and sleeping for 18 hours straight, not eating because you can't be bothered for days and other times eating constantly. Sometimes I'll just hold it for hours instead of going to the bathroom because I can't get out of bed.

You want to do things and say things and hang out and interact but you just... Don't. I wouldn't wish it on anyone "
"Nothhingness, just an amazing amount of nothing. You feel nothing, nothing really interests you anymore, all you want to do is sleep or lay down or sleep some more. Occasionally you'll have moments of normal where you'll laugh and joke and get excited about that band you love playing on the radio, then it'll all go away and you're back to the boring, repetitive nothingness."
Incoherent Screaming 
Bad.
"For me, it's about hopelessness not being able to achieve things you want to do, and just wanting to die.

Driving over a bridge is instantly met with the though of pulling over and jumping off, dealing with a negative person but that person lives in your head, being too tired to sleep and too awake to sleep being overly medicated to sleep.

Feeling demotivated to do any task, not washing yourself unless you are reminded
""when did you last have a shower""

Attempting suicide and failing so you can't even kill yourself correctly, staying alive because family guilt and things they have said to you.

Also being a master of disguise seeming happy and cheerful around people and inside loathing being that way.

Being on medication that makes you overweight but not motivated to do anything about it all the while comfort eating.

That's how I am, I have a child and hold a full time job I work hard and work around 46hours a week on minimum wage I'm trapped in a cycle and just existing.

"Honestly, I just wanna blow my fucking head off"
Knowing that there is no one in your life that is better off for having known you.
Best I can explain it is that everything is kinda bland.
"Am I a bad person for coming into this thread hoping the top comment would simply read, ""Depressing""?"
"Imagine feeling like you are behind on a huge amount of tasks you can never complete, so why even try to start. "
Foggy and heavy. 
"It's like everything is muted, like the world went from vibrant colors to grainy black-and-white... everything is meaningless and there's just no point in doing anything.  Even the smallest road bump completely knocks you over.  You can't help but view the worst part of everything.  Nothing is enjoyable, hobbies are pointless, exercise seems like an insurmountable task, even simple tasks are a giant effort.  Being around people is a challenge, and you pull inward only making the whole thing worse.

Then stretch that out for years and suddenly it feels like this is the norm and you can't even remember a time when you were happy.  Happiness feels like an abstract concept.

It truly is hell on earth."
"Like a hole. A hole that you're at the bottom of, where you can see the light above you, you know that somewhere up there is light and life, but you can't reach it. You have nothing to help you reach it. You only have a shovel, and yet every time you try to do anything to get to that light, you've only found that you've dug yourself deeper. 

And worse, even if somehow, through circumstances or medication or hard work, you've managed to learn to dig a ramp instead of digging yourself deeper and you've actually gotten to the light?

You never leave the hole. You've always still got a foot in it, this knowledge that's lurking in the back of your mind that it would be so damned easy to trip back into that hole and lose the light again. Sometimes, you do, and when you have, it's often so much deeper than before."
Best description I've found. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc
You can't want to. 
Not sadness. Surrender.
"It’s the feeling of making your own concoction of self hatred. There are times when you feel you can’t get out and it’s impossible to get anything done. You then get mad at yourself for the lack of productivity and sink even deeper, and that’s why people say it can be a downwards spiral because it’s so difficult for a lot of people to recover from long periods of despair and sadness. There are a lot of moments when you just want to get out of this world and leave forever because everything is piling up on you and you can’t help but feel it’s your fault. 

People sometimes misuse the word and say they’re depressed when say their nice outfit got a bad stain or the food in their fridge spoiled. Overhearing people that say they’re depressed and then watching them immediately get over it and recover can also be a factor that lowers a depressed person’s self esteem. The difference between sadness and depression is that sadness is being sad over say one event for a little while, but depression is the collection of multiple things that build up over time and hurt you for as long as you can bare it. The feeling of isolation when you have depression is almost an instinct, and the way we people treat people with depression that sit off alone is terrible, especially in schools. Depression is honestly one of the worst feelings you can mentally have, and yet so many people are affected by it and die from it every day. 

One of the worst factors about it is it can be difficult to spot depressed people sometimes. They may act fine around others, but when it comes to them alone, it’s a whole lot different. If you or a person you know becomes depressed and you’re aware of it, no matter the severity, go talk to someone about it. It’s welcoming to have someone you can talk to about how you feel and can help anyone overcome it."
"We all have an inner monologue, yea?

Now imagine the voice of that inner monologue is that of your worst enemy. All this person wants is to put you down. Nothing is good enough, and every bad situation you've ever been in is on repeat in the back of your head.

You day dream a lot, it's hard to focus. Yet, daydreams bring no relief because it's a monotonous drone of all of the above. It's all so crippling, and coupled with a listnessness like none most people can put into words. Every little chore, movement, feels like you have the weight of the world on your back.

All of this just to give more fuel to the worst enemy in your head. Took too long to get out of bed? Loser!

Ate gross fast food to try to feel better? FATASS.

Thought you could strike up a conversation with the cute girl? BETTER NOT! She'll know you suck!"
Sad.
"Think of the fear you have when talking to someone extremely senior and scary. That's what it feels like talking to everyone. 
Also, all you can think about is the utter futility of everything. The general indifference to everything can be very exhausting "
Empty
Sad.
Remember that TV show you love? You don’t have the energy or focus to watch it. How about your favorite food? Not hungry. Those plans you were so excited for? Text your friends and say you have a stomach flu because leaving your bed is just something you can’t do. The idea of melting into your bed and never leaving is your only small comfort.
"Nothing you can do is right - even the ""right"" things you do are torn apart by your thoughts - until there's no point in anything any more.

"It's like you are an empty, husk of someone else. You don't really feel or you feel too much for no reason. Nothing seems worth it anymore. You want to be alone but want love and attention as well. It. Is. Hell. "
"For me depression feels like emptiness, like something has fed on your hope and that the wires that connect your emotions to your head have been ripped out. Nothing sticks in your memory and nothing gets through to you. Time as a recognizable concept disappears, at times it speeds up to where hrs pass like minutes and at other times it slows to seconds passing like hrs.  Everything is meaningless and you have no power or energy to prove otherwise. Like a steal beam is strapped to your chest at all times, the functionally simple things like eating or getting out of bed become exhausting tasks and are often to much to conquer. I am isolated and alone at the bottom of a well. I am gone. 

Depression isn’t the absence of happiness it is just absence. It’s not being really sad it is not being. I would have killed to be sad, to be anything at all. "
"Like you have plenty of games, and enough money to get another one, but you just can’t get interested in any of them."

"Imagine your best friend gives you a free ticket to see your favorite band with them and offers to pay for everything and it feels roughly as appealing as a cat shit eating contest. But you decide to go anyway and instead of watching the band and moshing you sit in the corner and drink glass after glass of regurgitated V8 because you literally don't have the wherewithal to deal with happiness.

Depression is when wallowing in self pity makes you feel more alive than bone crushing numbness which is your only other option. 

It's when the person you love most on this Earth is equivalent to the smell of McDonald's. Meaning: ""It's sorta okay I guess..."" 

Throughout all of this you know you're hurting everyone around you in ways that they will probably never forgive you for and you feel powerless to stop doing so."
You would prefer not to live yet you would prefer not to bite the dust. You would prefer not to converse with anybody however you feel forlorn. You get up early in the day and basically sit tight for the night to come.

"There's this fantastic dialogue between two old age sibling in the show ""Please Like Me"" (available kn Netflix):

-John(dog)! If you were sad, what would you do? See, my Rose is sad. 

-No, I'm depressed. There's a difference. It's not sad. 

-Oh, what's the difference? 

-Well, you can't cure it with ice-cream. 

-We got beer! 

-You can't cure it... You can't cure it with beer! 

-Oh, well, haw-haw! Well, I have no idea.

It portrays how whatever you do, eat, sing(if you even manage to) you just can't enjoy it and shake that horrible, horrible feeling off. It's like being sad, guilty, annoyed and lazy all at the same time for no reason... And there's no cure."
"I posted this on a similar thread about ago. I’m still dealing with it on a daily basis but at the moment it’s all good:

I never realised what was going on until a couple of years ago when I finally spoke to my GF about it and we went to see the doctor together.

I would lay in bed until the early afternoon with no motivation to get up even when I knew there things to be done. Living with me must have been hell! I would get aggressive over the smallest things and snap. 

I've been taking tablets for 2 years now and I feel like a different person. It almost feels like a cloud has been lifted because when I look back at memories they seemed tinged in a grey cloud almost like they're in black & white.

The anxiety that came with the depression was the worst thing though. Going on nights out or lads holidays was always a struggle as I'd be constantly thinking about what could go wrong. In the end this caused me to go home early in most cases, missing out on a lot of things.

I look back with sadness now as I think about all the things that I've missed out on and all the enjoyment I've missed out on.

I went back to the doctor last week and I'm looking to start some sort of counselling alongside my medication.

I hope everyone can find help like I did. The hardest thing is realising that there is something wrong!"
Apathy Personified.
"I think it's different for everyone. For me it's a strange mix of this all encompassing apathy, and hating myself for not being able to care about things the way I should. There are things that I know I should feel sad, or mad about that I don't feel anything toward, and can't bring myself to. But then at the same time I'll be furious with myself, or sometimes damn near suicidal over the fact that I can't even force myself to feel something. 
 
And that's another thing, suicidal thoughts. I haven't actively wanted to die for a while now, but if something were coming at me that would end it quickly, I can't say I'd bother to get out of the way. I'm a passenger in a service van for up to 8 hours a day depending on what we're doing, and some days I'll just turn off my airbag, leave the seatbelt off, and see if my boss's ridiculously unsafe driving gets it done. Makes me feel better sometimes. Also, that's the first time I've said that and it sounds stupid as fuck. "
"I don’t feel anything. I haven’t felt a positive emotion in so long; I’m always sad and angry, and there’s nothing I can do about it. I can’t think right ever, my mind is always wandering. I struggle to keep a 4.0 in school, because I know I need it to go to a good college, even though I don’t plan on living that long. Everything I plan in advance is always halfassed, because I usually think I’d have killed myself by the time the event happens. My mind seems to be an endless journey of nothing. I always feel like I’m reading a 1000 page book about the process of photosynthesis; I’m so incredibly bored, I’ve started to doodle along the margins of life. I don’t think about what I do, because it doesn’t matter. We all die anyway. I can’t seem to transition sentences to another smoothly, I can’t find a way to make things rhyme when I work on music. Nothing I do is ever satisfactory to me. I’m never reaching my goal. But it doesn’t matter anyway."
Feels like every movement or thought is being hindered by a big layer of molasses that I can't get through.
"Personally? I get rapid mood swings. Sometimes it takes almost nothing to feel devastatingly sad.

Constantly feeling like im worthless, a failure, and that if i died no one would care.

I often find im tired and dont want to do anything, then get mad at myself for not wanting to do anything. Invites to do stuff with friends are often declined. Showering every day turns into showering every 2 or 3. 

Depression sucks. Even treated, its a struggle."
Horrible 
"It's shit man. It's just shit, every day, all day"
Feeling like you don't deserve happiness and that you'll never be good enough to have the life you want so why bother anyway.
"You feel numb/ emotionless or you’ll feel overwhelmingly sad for no reason. If you have good news, you’ll feel great for a really short period of time but it’ll escape you very quickly. You often feel like you’re just floating through life,  that you have no direction or purpose. 

For me, I don’t want to die. Death scares the crap out of me, but I don’t enjoy being alive either. If death didn’t terrify me so much, I probably would have committed suicide by now. I guess that’s a saving grace. "
"When a friend asks you, ""are you okay?""

The only honest response is, ""as okay as I can be."""
"I've been dealing with depression for the last 3+ years. It can be very debilitating including when you've been dealing with it as long and as young as I am, I'm only 15 turning 16 in a month. 

Having depression you start losing interests and friends. You want to do something about it but you feel like you can't do anything about it, so you don't do anything about it. All the things you wanted to do you no longer want to nor can you as you have no motivation to do those things. When you want to sleep you can't, as you can't stop thinking about what happened and what you did and what you might've said that was wrong even if it wasn't. You don't want to nor can you accept compliments from people, as you feel they're doing it out of pity, and you end up dwelling on it all day. You want help but you can't get yourself to find help; you want to someone to be with you to make you feel better and someone who is loyal and trustworthy. You can't get up for school, work or anything. You decide to sit in your room all day and isolate from everything that could go wrong that day. You have thoughts of hurting or killing yourself, but you decide not to as you either have no energy to do it or you just aren't motivated.

Like I said I've felt like I've been dealing with this for over 3 years now and I didn't reach out for help until quite recently, November of 2017. I ended up finding someone who understood me and made me feel better about myself when I was upset. She helped me reach out and tell someone about what was going on. She probably saved my life and without her I wouldn't have ever gotten help. Luckily I have supportive friends and family and when I told my mom about all of this she immediately got me into an appointment with a therapist that day. Then a week later I was hospitalized for my depression, and I then was in a program for a couple weeks until then again I was hospitalized again in the same month. I then continued with the same program at the hospital for another few weeks until then I was done right before winter break. All the help I've gotten has helped me so much and I am back to seeing my therapist and I just met with him yesterday."
"Every day blends into the next and the one before, because nothing happens, nothing changes.  It's just this endless stretch of nothingness where you stop feeling feelings the way you used to, because you're so numb that you just...can't.  It's not that you don't want to (because you don't want anything), it's that you literally cannot bring yourself to feel anything, about anything, including your own existence.  

At least at first, there were all of the negative feelings that people are describing: being awash in a sea of your own inadequacy, dwelling on every stupid thing you said or did, feeling this burning hatred for yourself and probably everything around you, feeling this sense of constant grief for everything and nothing in particular.  You maybe manage to extract yourself from the house once in a while, or maybe people come to you, and you try to act like people act, smile when they smile, and try to remember how normal people interact with each other.  Sometimes the mask slips and you say something that alarms the people around you, and you scramble to recover with smiles and laughs.

But eventually, the negative feelings fade away - and initially it's a relief, to stop feeling all of these horrible feelings constantly, almost enjoyable.  But then it becomes the all-consuming nothingness, where you don't want to talk, or think, or exist; your psyche is this barren wasteland where there was once life, you remember it being there once, but it becomes a memory.  The mere idea of leaving your house, or bed, or the floor is almost laughable, because the the sheer amount of energy it takes to do something as basic as feeding yourself or changing your clothes is nearly insurmountable.  Weeks take a minute to pass, while days take forever while you stare at the ceiling and use what will you have to hope you just stop existing.

Pulling myself out from that hole is one of the most difficult things I've ever done."
Pointless.

"Those that have depression for years start to have ""Brain Fog"".

Its just like it sounds. Your brain starts to get foggy when you start to think about things. Math? Starts to get increasingly hard. Remembering? You might as well be suffering from mild dementia.

You start to feel like stupidest person ever. People say things to you and when you reply, you have no idea what they just said. Or are you meant to say anything. Its like following orders in board game but with 40 different rule-sets you have to keep in mind, that is foggy.

You start to notice that counting pennies is like being child again, plus added self-doubt making you count them again just to be sure.

Its not always that bad, you can function like any other. But you just might have memories or basic stuff ""in fog"". Sometimes you take extra long to make coffee because you just cant make yourself start the process. And you KNOW its easy and you KNOW you are not ""this stupid"" so it makes it even worse.

Oh and honorable mentions:

People you know will start to question will you ""go crazy"" because their knowledge on basics of mental illnesses comes from 60s horror movies about ""crazy asylums""."
Painful. life seems slower. Things have less colour. Food has less flavour. Nothing brings you joy. It's hard to feel motivated to do anything. 
"For me, it's never waning to get out of bed or do anything (stark contrast from my usual self). I will lie in bed all day, won't eat, won't play games, won't talk to anybody. Any interactions are forced, and I drag myself through it, only wanting to return to my ""cave"". I want nothing more than solidarity. It's also a perpetual feeling of melancholyness, I'm never happy, nothing makes me smile, and nothing affects me in any, really. 

I get in this funk once in a blue moon (2-4 times a year), and it will last two weeks at the longest. I won't say I suffer from depression, because I have friends who depression is their daily struggle, and I really don't want to toss that word around, but I will say that I have experienced it, and I do not enjoy it.

"[this has helped me explain it to my mother](https://imgur.com/gallery/2khYwyf).    
This is what the post says: I once tried to explain depression to someone as like if one day you gradually started to lose both your sense of taste and your ability to feel full. And you don’t know why, but now everything you eat tastes like mashed potatoes and nothing you eat is satisfying. You keep eating because you must eat to live, but the effort that it takes to prepare food is taxing and there is no pay off. You just know it will taste like mashed potatoes. You just know you will still be hungry. So you stop bothering with seasonings. Then you stop bothering to use ingredients you used to like. Then you start to wonder what the point of eating is because there is no payoff. You still feel hungry and you’re sick of the taste and you don’t know if you will ever enjoy food again and you don’t know why this is happening.

If someone comes up to you in this scenario and says, “Well have you tried spicing your food? Using different ingredients? Eating foods you used to love?” It isn’t necessarily helpful because the reason you stopped doing all that in the first place is that everything…tasted…like mashed…potatoes."
"Honestly, terrifying at times to know that no one else can see or experience or understand the things that happen inside my own head. It feels sometimes that it's beyond help. And I don't even want help. I want a cure. Depression is desperation and fear and loneliness. Always loneliness. "
"David foster Wallace wrote a story called the depressed person. I think it was one of the most interesting, thoughtful, and moving things I've ever read about depression. I highly suggest reading it"
"From an older post will probably go unnoticed but the only way I could explain how it felt to me

Just about a year ago things pilled up on me, my grandmother just passed, my father's health was and still is an issue that doesn't seem to get any better, I have a mother and brother in jail while my free one has a cocaine problem and a girl I care about doesn't feel the same just to say the least, it all got to me and for the first time in my life I experienced depression, I had been said before sure but this time it was different I just couldn't care anymore to the point where I didn't even speak and even something like getting out of bed was a struggle to convince myself to do, if I could try and put it in words it was if my life was me and a group of people walking through a dark forest with nothing but torches to light the way and for some reason I just stopped. No one else did just me and the group break's away leaving me there without a torch getting further and further away, no one looks back, asks for me or I don't call out I just stay, watching the light of the group fade until I'm just standing there in the darkness all alone.

"The future is a straight line.  The course has been plotted as carefully as possible, and it's still going to go to shit.  

The past is un-touchable pain.  Sometimes for rational reasons.  Sometimes because it wasn't the outcome you wanted.  Sometimes because you just don't like having to be you.  

The present is a blur.  I can't focus.  I can't enjoy anything.  I am my responsibilities, without them I am nothing.  

There are different kinds of depression.  I'm not the ""I can't get out of bed"" kind, I'm the ""I've leveraged every negative emotion I can control to keep myself functioning, but living like this is hell"" kind.  

The therapy is helping some.  I'm not sure if the meds are helping or not, that's an ongoing experiment.  I still don't enjoy anything.  I still can't focus.  Day to day life isn't quite as unbearable.  

That's progress. "

You feel like an idiot because there's no real reason you should be so down but you can't stop feeling like you're the biggest mistake to ever happen and the world is crushing in around you.  You don't want to bother anyone with your problems because you being alive is a problem enough for them.  You don't want to kill yourself, you just beg and plead for God, or the universe or whatever you believe in to just let you fall asleep and never wake up.  And the thought of that is the only thing that makes you feel somewhat better."
"I agree with what Itsame_throwaway111 but I would also add that sometimes you lose any motivation. Just getting out of bed and getting dressed can be an accomplishment. 

That how it feels for me, I'm often alternating between a mindset of ""life has no meaning why even try?"" or a mindset of ""life only has meaning if you give it one. get it together!"""
"You ever hear your alarm clock go off in the morning and ask yourself, what's the point in getting up? 

Then sleep until 4pm, get up because your body is too restless to stay in bed, and get upset with yourself for sleeping in so late and wasting the day. "
Depressing
not to be rude but this still doesn't give me a glimpse of what it feels like. without having been depressed I would wager that's its still impossible to express the gravity of the dread. 
There's no words I can think of
"I think depression could be described differently by each person, especially so with those that have suffered long periods from it.

For me depression is a deep look inward. It's a non stop tunnel that goes to the core of you, and though you could never imagine it, just keeps going. There is no end to the tunnel. You can turn around and see the faintest light that you came in through, but you know you don't have the energy to make the trek back. So you become apathetic to it. You accept that there is no longer any light, no longer any color, no longer any comfort.

I think that may have been the hardest time for me. When I finally accepted that this was the extent of my existence. I spent years wallowing in it, feeling sorry for myself. Once I accepted the years of turmoil as my fate, I gave up.

Nobody can change that feeling for you. Nobody can make it hurt less. Even I couldn't change it.

I think one of the most hurtful things one can do to someone suffering from their depression is to talk like they have the answers,or to depreciate what it is you're really feeling. The whole line ""somebody has it worse off than you do"" only makes it worse. Telling someone to count their blessing only makes them feel more guilty about having no control over their thoughts.

I don't think there's any real correct way to deal with depression. I think everybody has their own path, and they need to learn how to walk it. Yes, people can help, but people can also hinder more than  you'd ever know.

Depression is something I've dealt with for a good 16 years or so now, and I still can't figure out how I could rightfully describe it jn a way to put it into perspective that doesn't take away from the meaning  of it. "
You can go your whole life without knowing and you'll likely be better for it
Serious question... seems like the amount of people that have depression has increased dramatically. Is depression the new normal? Same with anxiety that I suffer from. Seems like everyone has it and some amounts of it I would say are good. It’s interesting what a lot of people describe with what they suffer from with depression I can relate to with anxiety. I don’t think I’m depressed since i went through some bouts of it in high school and college. Luckily I was able to get out of it.
"It feels like a big black hole that is constantly in front of you. Some days you are a safe distance away from the hole, other days you find yourself holding on to the edge for dear life trying not to let it swallow you whole. I used to ask myself every day where I was in position to the hole. These days I’m a fairly safe distance so I don’t need to check in with myself as often. But it’s still there. It will always be there. I will continue my fight to stay as far away from it as I can."
"Back before I started working I was flopping back and forth between sleeping for 16 hours a day or staying awake for 40. It wasn't that I actively chose to do that, I just was either so exhausted from even a conversation with my parents or getting breakfast that I would pass out for nearly a full day. On the other hand there were days where I was so... Obsessed with what was said / done and events from years long past that I could not sleep. I could not get my head to quiet down long enough to sleep. All I could do is sit there and wallow in self deprecation which got worse as the hours went on until I eventually passed out from an inability to stay awake any longer. 


Thankfully that's not much of a problem anymore. Work tires me out enough that I can't do that. But there are still times where I start overthinking and start considering quitting and just secluding myself back to my room again. 


Which is another thing. Some kids, gamers especially think that it would be cool getting to stay home all the time and just play video games or watch tv. Let me tell you. It's not. It's the absolute worse thing you could ever do. It starts out an enthralling experience but as the weeks turn into months or even years it starts to chip away at you. You stop finding enjoyment in anything and just stop moving all together after a while. There were days I would wake up. Lay in bed and be unable to sleep but never get out of it. 


The only thing that kept me going was that I have a cat and needed to take care of her. I'm doing better now that I've gotten out of that environment. To be honest once you get out it's like... You never want to go back. You want to avoid the bedroom because it's like a prison over you. "
"I was on some meds for a while that my wife swears put me into a depressive state. She's probably right. I got off of them, and she swears I'm MUCH better.

But here's the thing: It was insidious. I didn't really notice it. From in here, I was just normal. That's why depression can be such a monster, IMHO. "
"For me, depression feels like nothing can go right and no one cares about me. No matter what other people do for me or say to me I still can’t convince myself that they really care about me with no ulterior motives. 

 You feel worthless and like your existence literally has no effect on anyone or anything. So if you were gone it wouldn’t change anything. I don’t get suicidal, I just wish I didn’t exist so I wouldn’t have to feel that way.

And at the same time you feel completely alienated and alone. Like no one could understand how you feel. Everything seems far away and too difficult to grasp so you just kind of give up on trying. And then you get mad at yourself for not trying. And then you feel bad about feeling bad.

Eventually you just decide to go to sleep because maybe then you can have some time where you don’t hate yourself.

I take medicine and saw a therapist for a while. It really helps and I urge anyone dealing with depression to ask for help and talk to their family and friends about how they feel. Things do get better. "
Feel? Numb and apathetic mostly.
"Its when sitting in bed doing nothing all day is the least terrible thing to do because everything seems so worthless. And you're too tired to do anything, ever "
"It hurts, literally hurts. Everything in my bone and heart and chest hurts. Depression is different for everyone, but I usually just want to be alone. I don't like company or want to be around people, the outside world disgusts me to the point I'm scared to even be seen. Abd when it's really bad, it drives my brain to think horrible stuff, and that happiness is almost a rare disease. I literally start over thinking everything."
Praying to god begging to die when there isnt one.
"It is a roller coaster.  Some days you are fine, others you want to crawl in a hole and die.  It has been nearly 8 years since I lost my wife and I battle it every single day."
"Depression is, bizarrely enough, depressing. "
"Exhausting.  Depression makes everything exhausting.

Everything that's worthwhile takes effort, right?  Establishing new relationships and maintaining old ones.  Taking care of yourself, physically and mentally.  Learning a new skill.  Mastering a current skill.  Reading.  Travel.  

Shit, even getting out of the house to go to your favorite restaurant takes a little bit of effort.

Depression makes the mere thought of doing any of that exhausting. Any and all effort becomes tiresome.

My form of depression doesn't come with much anxiety.  I feel like it's the exact opposite of anxiety - I just want to sleep all the time.  I'm tired when I wake up.  I'm tired throughout the day.  I can sleep for 8-10 hours at night and still take long naps throughout the day. On days when I'm feeling my worst, I'm only awake long enough to eat and use the bathroom.

Yeah, depression makes me so very tired.

That may not even be the worst of it.  I think the most insidious thing about depression is that it robs people of passion.  It makes me feel utterly bland inside.  The things I enjoy the most - like playing video games, going to the movies, writing, or speaking in front of a captive audience - do nothing for me when I'm feeling bland.

Take, for example, video games.  Loading a video game is one of the easiest things in the world, right?  It's fun as shit, too.  But there are days when even playing video games feels boring, so I won't do it.

Because things that I should enjoy can often feel boring, things I don't enjoy feel like the worst things in the world.  For example, it's been snowing a lot lately, so doing things like shoveling the driveway and scrapping ice off my windshield makes me hate the world for being the way it is.

I honestly wonder what it's like *not* to have depression.  What is it like to wake up feeling excited for the day?  To have long-term plans and to look forward them?"
It doesn't. That's half the point.
It's a bummer.
Like swimming in a sea of tears without a beacon to guide thee
"I dont care about myself or other people. nobody cares about me. I spend my days empty, staring into space thinking about all my problems and how nothin makes me happy and how everything goes wrong, every single time. all of me is failure. can't do shit right, so I dont even attempt doing shit at all. I'm empty and apathetic, I dont talk to people because no one understands and no one will stick around. don't trust myself, dont trust anyone. I try to hide it but my sadness shows on my face. sadness for no reason. life broke my soul and my passion leaked out of the cracks and now I'm empty. sadness cus I used to be so smart and bright, so energetic, so lovable. now I'm empty, everything I do hurts me, I'm failing the easiest classes because I just can't bring myself to fucking care. goals with no motivation and that just brings more self hatred cus i never ever achieve my goals. it's like I'm stuck in a chair watchin a film, mindlessly watching my life roll by and it's nothing but misfortune. and my eyes are empty. my heart breaks every morning that I wake up because I just don't fucking want to be here. the only release I have is when I sleep, so i sleep for 14 hours a day and I still wake up tired. constant, begrudging exhaustion. and it never. fucking. ends. and the only thing I can control is the cuts on my skin. I try to fill the void in my soul with drugs and sex and alcohol and cigarettes until the high is over and I'm just numb and smell bad. constantly running from myself and my flaws, constantly hating who I am. I'm alone and miserable, existence is suffering, and i wouldn't move if I was crossing the street and I saw a car speeding towards me. "
"Losing interest in the things you used to love doing. Losing connection with your friends because you don't know how to reach out anymore, and failing to make new ones because you're afraid of being put down. Realizing any talent you thought you had was just people being nice and talking you up in the past. Feeling like there's a gaping hole in your chest every night when you lie in bed. And you aren't oblivious to any of this, you know EXACTLY what is happening to you. But you can't do anything about it, because what difference would it make..."
"Take everything you read here as a personal account of what depression feels like to each individual. There is no universal depression experience. People are agreeing with comments because certain aspects may overlap from person to person, but each experiences depression differently. Don't feel invalidated if you don't feel exactly what someone says. Your mind is your own.

This will probably get buried, and probably has been said already in the comments, but I wanted to make sure it showed up."
Mine is just exhaustion. Absolute bone aching tiredness. Sometimes feels like flu. Like I have to rest if I manage to do one small task.
"Everything feels difficult, even thugs that seem easy to most. Forming thoughts and expressing yourself with accuracy is tiring. In fact ‘tired’ is a very good descriptor for it, tired in general, tired of life. "
"Its feels like everything that happens is your fault and no matyer how hard you try, there is no solution and no way out for you. And you are stuck in a personal bubble where you cant fix anything. The bubbles prevents people from touching you too. Prevents comfort, hugs and security. Bubble that contains all your anxiety, fears and loneliness all around you and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it"
I’ve always felt understood by [Andy Richter’s twitter rant ](http://time.com/5029929/andy-richter-on-depression/) about about depression
There's a lot of long winded answers here. Apart from the actually sadness and lack of motivation it really feels like a fist clenching inside your abdomen. You know that feeling you get when you're remembering all the awful embarrassing shit you've ever done before you go to bed? Yeah. That. All the time.
"During the worst time for me:

It felt like nothing.  Nothing good.  Nothing bad.  Just nothing.  You might think the ""nothing bad"" part would be good, but remember, you also don't feel anything good.  Everything is neutral.  It's like in those allergy medicine commercials where someone sees the world in grey-scale.  Everything is bland.  Everything is boring.  Nothing truly makes you happy.  Eventually, you just become desperate to feel *anything.*  This can lead to self-destructive behaviors.  Unfortunately, this can be when you start feeling bad.  Then, you waffle between feeling bad and feeling nothing.  You just want it to stop.  You'd be willing to do anything to make this go away... but you don't want to be a burden to the ""non-failure"" humans around you, so you trudge on.  You ride the wave, going from feeling awful to apathetic and back, wishing for the other depending which one you're currently experiencing.  ""This is so bad, why can't I feel nothing?"" to ""I can't stand this emptiness, I'd take pain over this!"" and back again."
"My depression feels like a million ropes coming out of my body and connecting me to my work, parents, son, husband, friends and every single thing that's happening in my life. 

Sometimes those ropes get so tight that I just want to cut them all and be free, but I can't, so I move towards some of them to make them feel loose, but since they're all around me, others become even tighter and I get angry and desperate... 

I have clearer days when I feel like the ropes gave a little and felt looser, but then something happens and thugs my soul painfully. 
On top of all that I have constant anxiety that keeps me on my toes even when I feel reasonably content.

I don't know how to make myself feel better, because those ropes will never go away. Some people feel connected and loved because of those ropes, but I feel trapped most of the time. It's not pleasant."
"Have you heard of the [Dementors in the Harry Potter series?](https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/dementors)

They suck all the happiness out of their victims. That's depression.

It's a weight you feel on your brain physically, accompanied by a ringing in the ears as negative thoughts fly through your mind. My voice also changes when I am depressed. 

After a while, it feels like things are never going to get better, that sadness stretches into eternity and becomes depression. 

It's a feeling that people who know you are gossiping about you and saying the worst things imaginable. It's when doing anything fun or healthy seems like so much work you just can't do it. It's constantly feeling tired. Talking to friends feels like work. Eating is just something you do to stay alive, not something to be enjoyed. 

I contemplated suicide for a while, as I never thought it would lift, so why continue this life of misery? I told myself that I would not do that to my parents, so didn't follow through. The state I ended up in was, ""I'm not going to commit suicide, but I understand why people do."" 

I got a better job, saw a doctor, and now I am better. Much better.

It literally feels like nothing.
"i was diagnosed with dysthymia and anxiety. for me, it was like being in a long dark tunnel where you can see that there is light at the end but you keep walking toward it and it keeps receding until you are so tired of walking you want to give up. then add to that the feeling that there is something in the tunnel behind you that is keeping pace, just outside of your sight, but ready to jump on you when you finally decide to stop. it was a constant struggle to keep going through the steps of living, finding no joy in anything but never so depressed that you want to step out of life altogether. then having anxiety attacks - what i used to call social claustrophobia because i didn't know it was anxiety - where i felt like i was trapped in a closet but it's because there are people around me and i can't get away from them."
"Depression is a demon. He gets into our heads. Convince us that we aren't good enough. That we're stupid, talentless, worthless, hopeless... He leads us to harm ourselves either as a way of punishment or to make us feel again from being so numb. He keeps doing this until you feel you have to end it all just to make it stop!"
"I read somewhere it's like you have to peel a potato with nothing, but when you're struggling and ask for help from someone, they hand you another potato."
"This will not doubt be buried, unfortunately. But here is my perspective. A lot of people say, ""you don't want to do anything."" I disagree completely. You do want to do shit. That room you want to clean? That song you want to learn? That story you want to write? That show you want to go to? Yeah, you want to do all of that shit. It ain't going to happen. Carpe Diem? You don't know the meaning because you don't even understand the concept. So instead, you start watching videos, you browse reddit, maybe even have a drink(this turns into 6+, then you realise that you are tired and you wasted another day. And the time comes and you just want to go to sleep to repeat your lifestyle. It is a horrible lifestyle really. Nothing ever get done, you are rotting away, and realise all of your lost potential that you may have have.

The worst part? Everybody tells you that you have so much potential in this world and that you will be great. Meanwhile, you are pushing 30 and know you are too late to become anything great(just like I am late to this thread), and will just become another waste of life that had dreams once. 
You wish everything was like the movies and that everything will turn around. You wish that maybe, just maybe, you will have a life altering event that tells you to go out and turn your life around. Maybe that you will meet new friends and that will be it. Like the Pink Floyd song goes, ""waiting for someone or something to show you the way."" 
Anyway, right now I should probably just stop because I am on a drunken rant. My point was, is that it isn't that you don't want to do shit. It is that you can't do shit. Your slothfulness just won't let you be. And everybody thinks you are a piece of shit for that slothfulness. Even if they don't say it. You can see from the look in their face.

"It's not just the sadness you feel it's more than that.

I have rapid cycling bipolar and when I'm in depression my perception of the world is distorted and events and people and situations I'll think everyone hates me and is talking about me.

I'll imagine ways to kill myself constantly. Like waiting for the bus I'll see a lorry coming and I'll stand on the curb imagining just tipping forward and stepping into the road. Then the wind and noise wizzes by me and the moments paw.

I'll be cold all the time as my metabolism has slowed down, I'll be too tired to shower or motivated to work so I'll make mistakes.

I'll look at myself in the mirror and I'll look ugly and distorted and fat and a deeper wave of sadness will come 0ver me.

I'll remember all the horrible things anyone has ever said to me and I'll cycle through them over and over.

Everything seems hard and like I shouldn't be in the world. 

Then it gets better and I think everything i thought when depressed was wrong and the world is beautiful and I'll email ceos my ideas get into arguments and quit jobs and buy lots of stuff 

Then I get depressed...."
"Well I have been depressed for almost 17 years and since 2 months I discovered it was caused by sleep apnea. 

A depression destroys you mentally but also physically. No energy for doing anything, thinking in circles, very difficult to see a solution for random daily life difficulties. You can't find the words to say a simple sentence, it's like there is a constant fog in your brain. You are always concerned about everything, specially about the future. You are holding back to the past when everything was fine. You avoid people, you don't understand why people enjoy themselves while there are so many problems. They seem to live in a total different world, that's why you hate society so much when you are depressed. You react very emotional to different situations. Always doubting yourself if you are good enough. Sometimes you think you are Jesus because the world was also against him, he had a quest that he had to do all alone, just like the quest you have with your depression making it through life. 

Physically: your body seems to protect itself from the outside world. Like a veil that's constantly hanging over your head, the world looks dark and colorless. Food tastes not that enjoyable anymore, you can't smell that good anymore odors. You can't stand too much noise or people so you have a minimum of social contacts.
A tight chest, a body full of stress and cortisol giving you a bloated not rested face. You look pale and frail, I think because of the chemical imbalances due to stress hormones. Headaches, being dizzy, anxiety attacks. Life was like moving forward with 50 kilos on your back.   "
"In a word... shitty.

I don't know how it feels for other people, but to me, it feels like 'the game'.

Every time I said or did the wrong thing, every time I interact with anyone, I replay everything in my brain an feel like there is some way I could have said or done something in a way that didn't make me feel like a complete and total freak."
"I'm late to this party but it all seems accurate.  Only been dealing with it since July last year.  Took 3 weeks off to recharge, just to come back and melt down entirely a month later.

I tend to lean toward feel completely detached from my wife, kids and work. I feel like there is no end in site from this mental anguish and start to look for paths to ease the pain and slow down my thoughts. Sometimes it's wanting to go back to drugs and sometimes it's wanting to just find some peace and slip into oblivion. This is why I was in the hospital a week ago. I just want to feel something again. "

"""Wiggle your big toe.""

Remember the Kill Bill movies, when Uma Thurman's character escapes from the hospital after being in a vegetative state for years? How she found her legs didn't work and she had to use all her will to physically get out of the hospital?

This is nothing, you won’t get anywhere with this shit! Who are you fooling, you can’t do anything good, this is nothing and you know it” and so on and so on. Then comes the giving up, the yeah you’re right voice, I can’t do shit, you’re overwhelmed by guilt, disappointment, shame and sometimes suicidal thoughts. It’s terrifying and crippling, you just want to bundle up in a corner so that no one can see you. Everyday it’s a marathon and exhausting."
"A lot of the top comments are correct, I just barely survived my first major depressive episode, 2 more and im on meds for life! A major issue I see with this thread is people who see things about not being hungry, or having issues waking up and just DOING things, and then saying ""OMG THATS MY LIFE. I HAVE DEPRESSION"". Now that is obviously an overblown example, no one said those words exactly, but I would say that for those of you who just started worrying about depression because of this thread, examine your life. Make sure that whatever example/symptom you're looking at is a reoccuring thing. If you consistently stay in bed all day, if you consistently cant eat, thats when you get in trouble. 

My Dads advice was wrong, he's a pull yourself up by the bootstraps kinda guy. If you see these descriptions and view it as a reoccuring problem more then just a few isolated incidents, seek professional help. Psychologists go to college to learn how to help you, and after meeting with one, you learn just how helpful they are!  

Now theres my two cents, I'd also add that eating right and exercising is like half the battle. But I'm losing the exercise part, and the healthy eating part, so if anyone has advice on that I'd be most grateful!

"
It sucks.
"Honestly, while these answers are good, they aren't full. And they can never really be full. Depression has a wide range of symptoms, yet at the same time, the symptoms are conflicting. Both overeating and not eating enough are symptoms of depression. Sleeping too much or too little. Drowning in work or being uninterested in everything. There are *some* common things that can be described, but the main problem with depression is that it's unique to everyone. You can't definitively describe what it feels like to be depressed."
Bad
It is hard to feel joy when you are depressed. Medications helped
Can someone touch on how the emotions of depression differ from those of grief?
"I saw an analogy once about a polar bear, but I can't remember where it is or who it's from. s/o to you if this is your analogy. here goes

Imagine you're working as a researcher in arctic Norway for a couple months. You really REALLY don't want to have a run-in with a polar bear (one of the few animals that track and kill humans for food), so you take all the precautions to hopefully not have that run-in. You don't store food in your tent, you set guards, you use tripwires rigged to noisemakers, etc etc. You settle down for the night, knowing the chances of that run-in actually happening now are very slim, like .01%, because you took all the precautions. You settle down and go to sleep, and then you get fucking mauled by the polar bear because it was hiding in the snow and you can never escape it. It's fucking terrifying. Let me repeat that for those who don't have depression. It's fucking ***TERRIFYING.***

"Imagine you're in a 10x10 square glass tank, and you're chained to the floor. Water starts pouring in, and you think you'll be fine, but then you realize that the water's getting higher faster. Before you know it, the water stops just right above your mouth, so you can just barely not breathe, because the chain is holding you down. If you work really hard and struggle a lot, you can get a few gulps of air, but it never lasts long before you're just back under the water. People are outside, but they're not really paying attention, and if they do it's advice like ""Yo, just go up and get some air, you'll be fine."""
"I'm in my 40's, and I feel like I have seen every aspect of the illness, so I'll try to describe it:

  Usually, it comes on with a little notice, not much mind you, but enough that you know an episode is on its way. As it develops, you get this general feeling of an impending doom that is featureless, but there nonetheless. You can't put a finger on why you feel like your world is crashing down, but it lingers in the back of your mind until it will no longer be denied and then it's the primary focus of your thoughts. I consider this the ""fog"" portion of a severe episode. The part where you could break down into tears at any moment, where you can laugh at a joke and still feel like you are dying a little bit on the inside. This dark cloud that just lingers for days, sapping you of the strength and energy to do the things that you know you love. Then comes the guilt and anxiety for feeling like you are a failure for not being able to will it away, and for knowing that the people you love are suffering along with you because they are lost for ways to help.

  After a few days of this (at least in my personal experience), the fog starts to lift a little bit. This is when I start to feel a little better. Maybe because I've dealt with it for so long that I know all the ins and outs...but I know when it's starting to go away. And this is the only time, during an episode, where I start to feel a little bit of joy.

  It usually lasts about 4 to 6 days for me. The second and third day always being the most draining. I have about 1 to 2 episodes a month depending on stress from day-to-day living.

  I think the hardest part for people to grasp is that someone who suffers from depression isn't unhappy. We still feel love, and happiness. But imagine the voice of that love, happiness, joy...is trapped in a sound proof enclosure. Unable to break through the walls to where it wants to be. Depression is that box."
"The world seems desaturated. Everything is less vibrant or colorful than it was before.

You still have emotions, you can be happy or have a good day for a while, but after a bit of time any joy gets sucked back out. Your memory censors all the good bits and you're left remember only the shittiest parts of whatever happened then.

You sit at your computer staring at facebook wondering if your *really* should send a friend request to that classmate that smiles and talks to you every day. Do they really like you that much? Of course they don't. Don't bother them. Sending a friend request would be creepy. What are you thinking?

You spend a year away at college and at the end of it you have a memory of a single grey day, a crappy academic record, and a mountain of regrets and missed opportunities. "
"I want you to hold your breath. Hold it until you cant possibly hold it anymore. That feeling you get in your chest in the seconds before you finally breathe are what it feels like. But people typically hate those who have a pessimistic world view, so put on a smiley face and do everything you are told with a happy heart."
Not good.
"I would compare it to what a submarine must ""feel"" like. Being deep in a cold dark place, where the sea you swim through wants nothing more than to crush you. 

A boat on the surface might call down ""Just go up!"" but you can't. It's not that easy when it takes all your energy just to keep from being crushed and you have no way to jettison the ballast. You deeply wish someone would lower a hook and pull you up, but you're also terrified that you're so heavy you'd drag them down instead. 

With nothing to do and nowhere you can go... you spend most of your time trying to ignore that crushing pressure. You sleep too much. You eat too much. You indulge too much. All the while panicking in some part of your mind you know that your air is running out while you screw around listlessly. You don't want to die, at the bottom of the ocean, having never gone anywhere. 

The worst feeling, for me, is the days where the pressure doesnt seem so bad. I start thinking that it might be ok for a bit and I encourage myself to go forwards. But then something hits me and opens a tear in the hull. I have to shut down the compromised parts and make sacrifices to avoid being flooded completely. 

To stay still, to accept help, or to go forwards blindly. All of them are terrifying options, each with their own consequences. It's easier just to sleep and pretend things are fine, ignore the panic (at least it doesnt hurt you), hoping that someday your environment might change on its own. "
"For me it's a lack of drive to do anything. I've been needing to get groceries for a month and a half now but I can't be bothered to go spend the hour it would take. Things I enjoy stop being fun and everything just becomes pointless as you ask why bother? And instead drown in either apathy as you lie there staring at a wall. Or wallow in old memories that hurt you just for no reason.

Imagine having a large gash that needed stitches and every time someone stitched it up you tore it open. And when they demanded an answer as tobwhy your best answer was. I'm not sure. I just did."
"You know the feeling you get when you make a bad mistake? Like you forget to finish an important project for work or school, and the consequences will probably be severe? Take that feeling and apply it to the majority of the events of your day to day life. All of the joy and brightness one might feel is flatlined, even in simple tasks like enjoying a cup of coffee or going to a movie. Positive associations are replaced with that deflated, nervous, empty feeling. 

As those feelings persisted, for me, it was as if the rhythm and energy of my normal life was disrupted. Imagine the narrative arc of a normal day, the rise and fall of energy from morning to night, along with the sunrise and sunset, is replaced by static. I felt like I was just floating along, with nothing to anchor my own narrative. Nothing to keep me grounded. 

The worst part is that you can't explain WHY WHY WHY all of these feelings are happening. It's like you've won the worst lottery in the world. And it's so hard to even try to approach someone to talk about it, because there's absolutely no frame of reference. And for me there was no one trigger or reason for it. It was just THERE.

The worst part for me was not that I was suicidal, but I fully understood the concept of suicide. I even applied a biological construct, in that depression and suicide was a force to weed out weak members of a societal structure. Those who couldn't sustain their own selves were somehow biologically triggered to take themselves out of the equation. 

Fortunately, things got better. It took a lot of work to combat the negative thoughts and use positive reinforcement. Make healthy changes and let myself go a little bit until I was able to fall back into the normal cadence of life that I understood. 

It's really very odd, to exist in an in-between space. Like falling off the page of a book and living between the pages, rather than existing in the story itself. 

This will probably get buried, but I hope someone might read it and relate and understand that those strange feelings were experienced by someone else, and that things turn out fine and go back to normal. And that more people than you'll ever know have been there too."
Ever feel like not doing something? now imagine that for things that you love and want to do.
TIL that what I'm experiencing is far from depression..It's just laziness. People have it 10 times worse.
"Say you're inside a bathroom sized box, which is filled with very very thick fog. You can't see anything or hear anything, and are trapped inside. But every few minutes there's this bright light that shines through the fog, bright enough to reach you, but the light is all the things you ever did wrong, all the hurtful things ever said to you. So it's either nothingness, or the lights. Both are bad, and there is no way out of the box. "
"In my worst episode so far... I was home because of my depression. My then girlfiend asked if I could just do one thing: empty the dishwasher. I couldn't do it, I simply couldn't imagine being able to do that. You could might have well asked me to climb the Himalaya unprepared. That's depression."
"Soul sucking. I found pleasure in nothing. I was pessimistic about everything. There was no light at the end of the tunnel. I didn't eat, I couldn't sleep. Nothing was exciting. Life just sucked."
"For me, my depression often takes the form of feeling a strong urge to act--to engage in some nonspecific activity--but anything I will try to do, such as playing a video game or reading a book, will feel boring and uninteresting and meaningless. It's a strong sense of restlessness that you can't appease or get rid of. This is when I'm on my medication. 

I went off of my medication for about a year a couple of years ago and that was quite an experience. I have generalized anxiety disorder and chronic depression (I was diagnosed around the age of four or five). I was okay for about four months but then I started getting really weird effects. I would start crying randomly, even though I felt no emotional distress or sadness. My eyes would just leak, no matter what I did or thought about. I got to the point where I was crying five or six times a day. I would cry at work and on public transportation and walking down the sidewalk and ordering food at a restaurant--it was crazy. I also had this incredibly strong sense of being trapped. I would panic over things that I knew didn't make any sense. It's really a feeling of being physically overwhelmed by emotions that don't even really feel like yours. I never felt like the emotions I was feeling were really mine because they were so irrational and often didn't have any kind of impetus or trigger. It felt like being hijacked by an outside force that I couldn't control. And, of course that feeling made me even more anxious. 

Anxiety also puts all kinds of thoughts in your head--every bad thing that could happen to you, worries that you're not doing what you are supposed to with your life, worries about hypothetical medical problems, loved ones dying, the inevitable heat death of the universe--your mind is constantly bombarded by these things, even though you actively know it's silly and pointless to worry about. They are completely invasive. During the time I was off my meds I got to the point where I was so inundated by these thoughts that I was virtually paralyzed--I could hardly bring myself to do anything, whether it was going out with friends or paying bills or doing tasks for my job or going to the doctor, because of this irrational fear that I would somehow fail or something bad would happen. Keep in mind that these are all emotions--it's what your body physically feels, even though your mind knows everything is fine. It can be insanely difficult to override these emotions. 

So, I finally managed to make an appointment with a psychiatrist and she put me back on anxiety medication. It was so freaking weird. The first day I took my new pills, everything went back to normal. The random crying stopped immediately, as did the flood of invasive thoughts and emotions that felt like they weren't mine. It was like I was suddenly totally normal again. Don't think I'll be going off them again, but it was definitely an interesting experience!"
"In high school I was depressed and hid it from my parents for a year. I was a good student, and I volunteered with the Big Brothers Big Sisters program. After one session with my Little Sister, I remember walking home in the rain, telling myself I was terrible at this, a failure, a bad role model. She would be better off if I wasn't there. I wanted to take the scissors in my backpack and cut my throat with them.

I didn't kill myself. Why? Because I was afraid that my mother would feel guilty for not stopping me. Not that she would be devastated and never recover from the loss of her daughter, but that it would be an inconvenience for her that she would have to explain to her friends and coworkers. As though I were an obligation and not a beloved child.

Depression convinces you that you are worthless. That people would be better off without you in their life. That by disappearing you would be saving them from having to deal with you. It's not true. The people I have known who have attempted or completed suicide were loved desperately by so many people, and that is why I will never do it, even at my lowest points."
"You feel that everything you do is always being judged by others around you. You criticize yourself on everything you do. Nothing is right. You feel like anyone who is nice to you is just being nice because they pity you. You feel like you cannot improve because you're never good enough or you know for a fact you will fail. You purposely alienate yourself because of these feelings. And then you beat yourself up because you realize you're depressed. ""What the fuck is wrong with me?!"" 


It feels like physical pain sometimes. Like your heart is just being crush some days or it's a dull ache, almost like a tooth ache. Some days you just cry and cry but it never helps. 

All of this while trying to pretend everything is ok in front of everyone else. And you're beating yourself up for lying to others at the same time."
"Fuck, I'm leaving this thread before I fall back into depression! "
TIL i am depressed
"Most of these comments are spot on. But for me it feels like being completely empty (emotionally). With a whole lot of self loathing. Looking in the mirror and audibly saying, ""nobody cares"", ""you're ugly"", ""kill yourself"" etc.

You know how when you're wearing headphones in a busy place and everyone just sorta seems fake. Like they aren't actually doing anything and if they are it seems like they don't understand what's going on. IDK how to explain it but that's how I feel about nondepressed people. They are just fake"
Awful. I literally haven’t gotten out of bed in like 24 hours. 
Tired. I feel so tired to fight the voice in my head letting me down every single second.
"Imagine that your walking upsteam in a river against the current. It’s pushing hard against you and you’re fighting with everything you have to keep moving forward, but always feel like you just can’t move ahead. Occasionally the current dies down and you get a little rest, but soon it will pick back up.
you
Meanwhile your friends/family/loved ones are all standing on the path next to the river, they’re trying to tell you this path is so much easier if you would just climb out. You can see others walking this path, but can’t find a way to climb out of the river. Sometimes those you thought were there for you move along down that path without  and sometimes they stay next to you and move along at your pace.

I’m still working my way to the shore."
This [video](https://youtu.be/vpUf7N44xOY) describes it well.
"For me, it feels very ""heavy"", or at least, like I'm weighed-down or something.  Like, there's just a pure, deep ache keeping you anchored in the water, and you don't know why it's there and you don't know how to get out from under it. And, some days you think that even if you knew how to get out from under it, you wouldn't really feel like it or be able to get the motivation to do so.

Another thing for me is a complete lack of interest no matter what it is (except maybe sleeping more). Everything feels so grey to me, just so bland. I love drawing and playing video games, but even the thought of doing those things bores and exhausts me. "
"For me it feels like walking over a deep well, that goes down forever, on planks that are suspect at best. You know they're going to break if you do anything, and then you'll fall. So you do nothing. And those feel like your options- Move and fall, stay absolutely still, or jump.

It is so tiring."
"It's kind of like being sad, except it's in your head, and your heart, and your bones. And it doesn't go away from conventional means, so you get to listen to your internal voice explain all of the reasons why you don't deserve that outcome you're thinking of, or why you're not good enough to be around those people.

"
"for me it feels like that small heart attack moment where you feel in the pocket of your pants and your smartphone is gone, prolonged times infinity"
Depressing
How much time ya got?
"Not just not wanting to do anything, but it is also sometimes that you want to do things but don't have the energy or enough care to do it. It especially sucks if you have work needed to be done for school or work and you just don't care about failing classes or losing your job. You don't feel anything but a weight in your chest. You don't have any emotion either than lack of care, lack of energy, lack of motivation. People always say depression is an intense and prolonged sadness, but I feel it more as a prolonged sense of uselessness and hopelessness. I don't feel particularly sad. I just feel tired of everything."
Depression is try to be somebody you aren't. Faking a personality every year. To the point where you lose who you are.

"Lots of people on this thread with some quite profoud definitions of their feelings. Many have resonated with me and I wish you all the best. 

All I would add personally is how things morphed when my son and daughter came along.

Suddenly my life had tangible meaning. I had a purpose which was simply to be a good Dad and help them become great people. I dared to believe that this may have been the turning point my life clearly needed. Alas, now the mistakes I make torture me so much more. Every little thing that I regret is so much more profound when I look at their little faces and know that they deserve better. It's like the more they love me or look up to me the guiltier I feel. 

The good times are the hardest to deal with. Sometimes on trips away or birthdays I feel so much that it's all just too much like an unbearable pain but a happy one that I don't want to end. I'd never experienced that before. Holding back the tears until it passes becomes my primary objective in these situations. Then I want to cry because it's over. 

I do now know that any lingering thoughts ending my life are nothing but fantasies intended to help me feel a meager sense of control. I'd never leave them. 

What I do now have is a sense of pride that eluded me previously. I watch them developing and see how they take regular compliments from other people and teachers and the logical part of my mind knows that I am doing something right. "
"I read this somewhere on the internet. I'll type it based on how I remember it:

Imagine walking waste deep against a current. It shows no sign of letting up and you can't get out. It would be a lot easier to let go and let it pull you under. Sometimes, you'll get a good grip on a branch or a rock. The struggle is easier for a little while, but the branch will snap or the rock will come loose. 

The rock that came loose begins weighing you down because you don't know when to let go of it or you simply won't. (Drugs and bad relationships). 

The branch seems sturdy at first, but you can't rely on it forever. (Positive circumstances). 

Every once in a while, a fellow human will know how to help you get out. If you make an effort, you can get out when help is available. The struggle seems as if it will stay in the past. However, that same person can shove you back into the river that they pulled you out of. 

Eventually, the roaring river wraps back around and you'll have to attempt to cross it with others or on your own. You'll be far more likely to cross it with others depending on who they are. 

It took only a few steps before you were trapped in the current again. Being out of it for a while makes being helpless a lot worse than it was before. You can't see a point in struggling anymore because the river will always be there to force you back to square one. "
"Personally? Feels like nothing, to sound edgy it just makes you feel like everything you do drags you down or is boring. I end up being unmotivated to do anything and this results with me sitting in my room just in my own thoughts. After a while I realized that I isolated myself from my friends, which didn't help. 

I was diagnosed with depression in grade 7 but never dealt with it, now near ending grade 12 I finally feel things.  And as I reflect back I realize that this just fucked up my high school experience, and all it brought me was horrible marks and few friends.  "
"Crippling, dehabilitating sadness.

For absolutely no reason.  Nothing is going wrong in your day, you will feel no pain. But suddenly this feeling of overwhelming crippling sadness just comes over you sometimes.

It sucks. "
"It feels lonely when you're with other people.

Sometimes it feels like absolutely nothing.

Sometimes it feels like a physical weight in your chest.

Sometimes you feel sad sometimes you feel happy but you always feel unsatisfied"
Like my body is constantly filled up with tears that are about to overflow from my eyes at any second and there's nothing I can do about it
"All of these answers are spot on so this seems redundant. But depression, in my description, is being absolutely bored with life as well as frustration that I can't get up and do something about it. It's hardly ever sadness unless it gets really bad. Mostly it's just living in a world that's not quite real, but not quite a dream either. I live out my days dreaming up worlds I can't go to. Nights are either restless, or coma-like. I often forget what day it is, sometimes what month. I always try to plan things with friends. Not because I care about hanging out (I feel horrible for saying it like this) but because if I don't do something to get out of this hole. It's going to swallow me up and I'm gonna end up dead in my bed. Life is hard with depression, but those who haven't been through it have no idea how hard it gets. What's worse is a lot of people ARE going through this. But we wear our masks so damn well. That nobody thinks anything is wrong in their circle. And we live out our days thinking we're all alone in this silent war. The only thing I could suggest to battle this is to be more honest to yourself and those around you. It's difficult, I'm failing right now. But as long as you don't give up, you'll get there eventually."
Flat and empty
"It's like everything becomes a chore. Like even the stuff that you should normally enjoy, you just don't want to do"
"What are you a robot?  Everyone experiences depression from time to time. Of course there is different degrees. Some of us experience short spurts. Some others last for weeks, months.  Asking how it feels to have depression is like asking how does it feel to have diarreah.  Maybe word it differently?  How does it feel to be in a constant state of depression? "
I'm sure it feels great.
Pretty bad I reckon. 
Being numb but at the same time broken.
"Sometimes after a suicide, you hear people say things like ""I had no idea they were depressed! Why didn't they reach out?""

Frankly... sometimes, we can't. I look at my phone, or my laptop, and think about how I could just message my sister, text my boyfriend. Let them know I'm being pulled into the abyss again and how miserable I feel.  Sometimes I can do it, I can type out the words or say it out loud. But... 

Sometimes the depression tells me not to. That I shouldn't bother them, I bother them enough. And sometimes... sometimes I just literally can't say anything.

 I know my support team wants me to reach out. My boyfriend and my sister are just the most helpful people in the world. I know they'd rather help me than let me feel so goddamned lonely. It's like the words turn to ashes the minute I reach for the phone. The words just don't exist to be spoken out loud.  I could reach out any talk about anything else, but the minute I try to share those feelings, the ability to talk just sorta evaporates. If they point it out though, if they say ""You doing okay?"" or ""What's going on?"", then I can talk about it. The words unlock when someone looks at them directly. 

I'm really, really, glad I don't have any sort of suicidal ideation. When the words don't come, I can still exist and function. It's not that way for everyone.

If someone seems a little off, say something to them about what you're seeing going on.  Help them unlock the words. 

"
[Something like this](https://youtu.be/dGalix-sVXs)
"Sometimes depression is like an open wound. Whatever emotion presents itself, you have to feel fully and completely. This sadness isn't any bigger or smaller than that sadness. They are all huge, full force, and demand to be FELT. Emotions so strong they rip through you, and you are left feeling out of control and a little broken.

-
    
Sometimes depression is like a thick blanket. The sites and sounds of the outside world are muffled because you just don't care enough to bring them into focus. Everything is soft, dull, and uninteresting. It's awhile before you realize that you haven't done a single thing for minutes on end. Sitting, unfocused, and numb you realize you don't want to do anything, and maybe it would be easier to take a nap than make a decision to do something.

-

Sometimes depression is a voice. Your voice. Putting you down for the tasks you haven't done, the social interactions that you messed up, and a whole host of personal criticisms. The voice pops up in between things you say to others, or when no one is around. It's like the classic devil and angel sitting on your shoulder but the angel just stopped showing up. 

-

While I do still regularly feel both sides of this coin, and hear that critical voice, I've learned to manage how much it affects me. Depression is going to be part of my life forever. I will never be cured of this, or come out on the other side a new happy forever person. Things got better when I accepted that this unwanted passenger is here to stay. Symptoms can be managed, and you can implement good habits that help you to cope, but you won't find a miracle cure."
"Have you ever played a video game for a while, then realized that it's not fun at all? You only keep playing it because your friends would be disappointed if you left.

Now imagine that life is that game. "
Hard to explain.
"Sometimes...it doesn't. And that's the worst part. Knowing that any normal person would feel *something*, but for you there's just...nothing."
Bad.
its depressing.
"I found this blog with cartoons on it when I was going through it (i speak in the past tense but I'm not sure I'm completely over it yet) and it made me laugh and cry at the same time because it was so ridiculously accurate. Part 2 was my favourite - http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/depression-part-two.html

The stuff about feelings just really hit home for me, particularly the image where she shows herself having the same feeling and facial expression about absolutely everything.She then has to start trying to emulate a happy face in order for her friends not to think she doesn't care, even though she wasn't feeling it. I distinctly remember feeling like I looked like the fakest person in the world because I was just having to try and pretend I was feeling how I was supposed to be feeling, while actually feeling nothing. All the while knowing that I previously would have been feeling genuine emotion and giving myself a hard time because I didn't feel that way, feeling guilt towards my friends because I couldn't be the friend they wanted me to be and feeling like an alien.

"
"For me it's just like the world has become dull. I don't have a terrible depression but for almost 10 years it's just something that feels like it's in the background of everyday life. It comes and goes and stupid things that don't even matter can set it off to a much larger depression for awhile.

Most things don't really make me happy. A joke and whatnot can get a laugh out of me, but the moment it's gone, I go back to feeling nothing. I love art and natural beauty but when the depression kicks in, it's like colors aren't as bright and I don't feel happy about things that normally I know I would be scrambling for a camera to try and save a picture of. 

Nothing is fun. I do things because I feel like I should, not because they makes me happy. Most days I feel like my goal is just to exist until tomorrow and hope I can feel better.

I am currently trying to beat the depression back if possible and trying to pick up things I used to love go see if I still enjoy them. Like playing my violin.

I'm sure there are people who are far worse off than me, but depression is more than constantly suicidal feelings. Some people don't seem go get that. For me it's just something that has pretty much always been there. Like a nugget of loneliness deep in your stomach that you can't seem to get rid of."
"There's a short memoir on depression by William Styrone, called ""Darkness Visible."" I highly recommend it. He's an excellent writer who conveys his subjective experience with an enviable eloquence.

Everyone's experience of depression is somewhat different, depending on the causes. For myself, it was a lot of hopelessness and numbness. /u/itsame_throwaway111 described the experience very well. I still have days when getting out of bed seems like a dreadful idea, but I'm recovering. By happenstance I found a good partner, and she has helped me immeasurably.

For those still in the depths: it's a long road but it has an end, keep going. Therapy helps (you may need to try different therapists), and friendships are invaluable."
Does anyone hate seeing other people depressed and/ or in pain? When I do I want to make them feel better and do whatever it takes. Maybe because it reminds me of myself and I don't want them to have that pain. 
Everybody here should listen to the opening lines of [this song](https://youtu.be/B0sy7y54XAE). It's an incredibly accurate description of depression. 
"Think about the moment when the person you love the most made you feel the happiest. Its the exact opposite, the days feels hazy, your shoulders feel heavy, the smile you make is false, and it makes you feel worse for even having to fake it. Every decision you make starts to feel like it has no purpose, and that you are better off staying out of sight so no one has to recognize what you're going through, because you don't want to talk to them about what is going on. "
Not great
"In short, it feels like nothing is interesting and exciting anymore. You are not necessary sad all the time. It's just there is no pleasure in the things you come across with. A sunny bright day, a smile from a pretty girl, a pay raise, a hug from somebody,... you are numb to all that."
"Jesus, this makes me feel like I need to do something.   What steps do you take if you feel this way?"
"Many people here writing several paragraphs on how it feels. But I'll capture it with one word:

Worthless.

It doesn't matter what you do, how you do it, when you do it, what others say, if it's positive or negative. Everything feels worthless and you feel like the most worthless thing in the universe"
"I had it so bad once I literally couldn’t feel emotions anymore. It was the most terrifying thing i ever experienced, I thought I’d be like that forever. "
"You know the feeling when you're sick/hungover, where you know you're hungry and you know you should eat, but every food you can think of makes you feel disinterested at best and nauseous at worst?

That, but not just about food (although it is definitely sometimes about food). You feel it about activities -- you know you're incredibly bored, but nothing is interesting anymore. You know you're lonely, but you feel like you're bothering everyone if you ask them to hang out. You know you're sleeping too much, but getting out of bed feels akin to climbing a mountain. You know you need to leave the house more, but you can't bring yourself to put pants and makeup on.

And on top of that, you feel guilty about not being able to do these things, so you just sit and watch yourself deteriorate."
It doesn't.
Damn after reading these comments it sounds awful. I hope meds help?
I feel like a glass of water that was emptied out
"It's like being at a party with a shitload of people. Everyone is in pairs talking to each other, and you're in the corner by yourself thinking that everyone is talking about, ""Why is that POS here? Nobody wants him here."" You're positive everyone is saying that, and there's nothing you can do to change it."
Indescribably shitty
"Empty. Im have severe depression and its dangerous because I cant visually tell you Im sick. If you have not had it, you have no idea which makes it worse. Migranes are a good example. If you have never had a migrane you cant comprehend how bad it feels."
"Think of yourself as an older model iphone. Your battery is weak and everything uses far too much energy. You may have all the same apps as everyone else,  but they don't work as well and many functions crash your system. Constantly having to recharge. Random crashes.  You are stuck with this crappy thing because you have a long contract, so you just have to sit and take it until you get updated.  "
"It feels like not showering for weeks because you haven't gotten the energy or motivation to do so. It feels like failing all your classes because really, what's the point? Depression feels so fucking numb and it sucks."
Like all Joy has been sucked it off existence
"to put it very simply, exhausting "
Not very good.
"Imagine loving something so much, but having zero interest in engaging with it or anything else. Say you love wood working or video games. Your life revolves around it. Most of the time, you have zero drive to even touch it. You just sit and do nothing, trying to figure out how to fix whatever is wrong with you."
"The easiest way I've found to show people what depression is like for me is to have them watch Inside Out. There's a part near the end when the girl runs away and the emotion control board in her mind turns grey. None of the emotions can get anything to work. That is depression for me. Literally every emotion stops. I'm just numb. I'm not overly sad, but I also feel no happiness. I could just sit on the couch all day and do nothing and feel nothing. It's awful and takes a long time to get out of that state of mind. "
"It's like having that feeling of numbness you would get in your legs if you were sat down for too long, except its in your head. You get a lack of concentration, maybe even just emotion in general and it can happen any day of the week without warning, it's completely unpredictable. 

And it fucking sucks. "
Depression is like climate and sadness is like temperature 
I feel like i see a lot of myself in this thread..
"I’m on Effexor. I don’t really care most of the time. I could get mildly excited for things or just no reaction at all. I do have better days where I actually feel like a person, but usually I’m just passing the time. I don’t really care about my future, I don’t care about fixing my alcohol problem, I don’t care about uni. I don’t really know how to feel about it. "
"Complete apathy masking a core of total panic. I'm constantly anxious and I can feel myself ruining my life but who cares, I'm tired again. Knowing everything is going wrong but not having the energy to do anything but roll over. 

I've lost the ability to get angry, or at least at other people. Nothing anyone says bothers me, unless it's something I've already said to myself. Then it leads to a cycle of frustration and self loathing"
"It's not being sad. It's a pervasive apathy, like a gray fog that soaks into everything. Nothing excites you, nothing stimulates you--everything you used to like has the joy drained from it. Everything you were passionate about doesn't matter at all. Like standing in a downpour but instead of feeling shivery, cold, and jumpy you just feel numb, without the motivation even to take a step toward shelter. Depression is recursive. It makes you the miserable singularity at the center of your own tiny world, unable to move outside your own thoughts. And it's sneaky...dear god is it sneaky. Even though the ""frog in boiling water"" example isn't scientifically true, it's apt when talking about depression. Because it's so insidiously gradual, you don't feel yourself sinking or notice your perspective disappearing until you're at the bottom of the hole and all you can see and smell is darkness and rot."
"The way I like to describe it in simple terms, is imagine that you have a wet blanket wrapped around you all the time. Even on the best, sunniest day, you still have that wet sticky blanket around you. "
It sucks.
"It feels like being in a hole, and the only tool you have available is a shovel."
"It feels like being down a very long well that is by the shore and the tide is coming in. It is secluded and no one could hear you even if you did scream. But you won't, why would you. It makes no sense to make any effort, you just aren't worth it.

As the tide slowly drags in the well begins to fill, it is scary, but you know it is OK. The world is better off without you anyway. The pain of drowning will bring a physical pain to an emotional one and let you be able to feel. 

There is no sense in struggling, just let the tide roll in, you can't stop it anyway. The tide is inevitable and unstoppable. So you lay there and wait. Wait for the salty pain to take you away, you know it is coming. It could take hours, or a few minutes, but it is there. It is coming, and there is no escape. "
"You're mad at yourself for the way you react to others when triggered because it wasn't how you really felt but then don't trust how you're feeling now, and are you really mad? How can you know what your emotions and opinions of things are and what are depressive reactions to things? You can't trust any feeling you have because you can't know what is real."
It feels like everyday is a very long day. 
"Sometimes it feels like you're drowning, when you're literally just lying down in bed doing nothing. "
"The side of depression a lot of people don't see is the lack of self care. It's having to put showering and brushing your teeth on a to-do list so you do them every day, it's dirty laundry piling up because you don't have the energy to wash it, empty takeout containers on your floor because you can't face the thought of going outside and seeing anyone. Sometimes it's the quiet things like not loving yourself enough to change your bed sheets."
"To me it's the absolute lack of feeling. I don't feel nothing, no sadness nor happiness. I don't care about anything, not even the most basic stuff like showering and eating. For years now I've been wishing to cry just once because I miss it so much, I miss being sad. I've wasted an entire year of college because I didn't attend any classes, and I don't even care. You feel like you're an empty vessel, the real you is somewhere else and the you you just wants to sleep all day long untill it disappears. Not a cool thing"
"This person said it best when it comes to BPD:

Borderline personality disorder

By networklackey

“I have only gotten better over the years at recognizing and modifying the behavior through meditation and introspection, but it's always there. Doom! Doom! Doom!
BPD is like having a normal functioning logical center, and then having two emotional centers, the one that is you, your real emotions that are reasonable for the situation you're in, and a bigger, stronger, and in my case much angrier, emotional center that belongs to the disease, that has swallowed up your real emotional center and suppressed it until it's almost non-existent.
So instead of having a normal, rational emotional reaction to situations this diseased emotional center calculates the worst possible emotional responses you can have and sends all that to the logical part of your mind.
So you think of something mealiness and stupid, just a passing thought like ""I've got to pay my rent this weekend"" and your brain starts twisting that at a billion miles an hour in every possible bad direction into the most horribly negative things possible until you are now close to catatonic in a fetal position because you've turned ""I have to pay my rent..."" into ""I'm going to die alone in the gutter.""
So you end up with wonderful things like the death of your mother making you feel nothing, while a tampon commercial makes you have a nervous breakdown.
It's like your brain is a separate entity that hates life and wants to die but it can't act in the physical world so the only way it can destroy itself is to convince you (the consciousness) to destroy it by making you feel so bad you kill yourself.
The saddest thing for me is that it makes me quiet, introverted, and more than a bit creepy to people who don't know me... ironically I'm thought of as an emotionless robot, not because I'm shy, but because despite the fact I may look calm... there's a lifelong battle raging between my ears that I'm always one step away from losing... so I have extreme issues with interacting with people... which increases the isolation... which feeds into the disease... which increases the symptomology... which makes me quiet... and a feedback loop gets started that's unbelievably difficult to get out of.”"
"I would like to know how it feels to not have depression. This pit in my gut, this weight on my chest, this constant worry, anxiety and voice telling me I'm shit. To have that all gone, even for a little bit, would be amazing. "
"You know how it feels when you have something bad happen (just got fired or someone is sick or died) and you wake up in the morning happy, then just remember that bad thing and all of a sudden feel crushed? Like the wind knocked out of you and all of a sudden sadness and darkness and dread sit on your shoulders?

It's like that all the time, but you don't have that big reason. Or maybe you did- but that crushing feeling never dissipated. Just stuck around.

That's how it felt for me, at least."
"The craziest thing for me is the intense mood swings. I can be my regular goofy, laughing, excited self one minute, and then when I get triggered (like if my wife brings up the vacation we are about to go on that I'm stressed about) all I can think about is how miserable I am and how I just want to go disappear into a bottle, smoke a cigar, play a video game.

I guess the other thing that makes me feel insane is my concurrent desires to be with and away fromy children. I want so so badly to disappear to my computer room, yet I want to be present and engaged, but I feel like that would take energy that I don't have.

That's really the core of it for me. Everything, *anything*, takes extreme amounts of focus and energy- a d I feel like I have none of either of those things.

Then I guess there's the feeling like a soulless husk.

I'm not so bad most days, but i can definitely tell a massive difference in just one day depending upon how much I sleep."
Not great
"I got home the other night and just started crying as my mind continued to tell me I'm worthless, pathetic, a sad excuse for a human being. I tried writing in my journal, something that normally makes the feeling fade, and wrote nothing but slurs about myself. I wrote it over and over and over for hours until I couldn't make sense of the words. I cried as I held my phone wanting to find help but knowing I am nothing but a burden to the people I love and know. I cried until I feel asleep. I woke up the next day and my mind had stopped fighting. I was numb and yet my body ached. The curtain on the window went back and forth, back and forth, for hours until I worked up the motivation to at least take a fucking shower. Back to bed, trying to fall asleep to avoid the void, and end up listening to the fan . . . it's getting cold but what does that matter? I can't be bothered to turn off the fan. I finally fall asleep and stay asleep for the rest of the day. Wake up the next morning and feel okay. Cautiously test the waters by talking with people. Still feeling okay. Someone said a joke and I can smile. Still feeling okay. Spend the rest of the day, and the rest of my life, waiting in terror for the mornings when my happy pills aren't quite enough to overcome the bleakness my mind creates."
"Feelings of worthlessness.  Constant, self-inflicted mental pain.  Spiraling thoughts that loop back to the cause of all your misfortune being your own fault because of how worthless you are.  Feeling the inevitability of driving everyone that cares about you away because they'll figure out you aren't worth it.

Everyone is making fun of you.  Always.  Every comment you can't hear is talking about how ugly you are, how gross you are.  How you should just disappear for being such an eyesore.  Your presence is a drag on everything.  They're eventually going to assault you, physically or verbally, and because of that you need to be halfway into a crippling panic attack at every moment when you're around strangers.  You need to have a full blown paranoia fueled panic attack in a Walgreens parking lot because you just know someone here is going to hurt you or your SO and it will be all your fault.  If you weren't so horrible, nobody would want to cause you pain.

People telling you they care about you sounds hollow, false.  They're just telling you nice things because they're supposed to.  They don't really mean it.  They know how worthless you are but society says they can't tell you the truth.

Good things that happen are treated with skepticism and mistrust because nothing good happens to you, you aren't worth it.  Happiness turns into pain because you feel like people aren't being truthful with you and just telling you how much they hate you.

Believing that no matter how much your SO tells you that they love you and would never leave, that there's an inevitability that they're going to cheat on you.  Not because of their character, but because you're a horrible person that's going to eventually push them away with how worthless and awful you are so when they inevitably cheat, it'll be your fault.

Not caring about being healthy or taking care of yourself because you aren't worth it.  Eating food is something people with worth do.  You should just go to bed hungry tonight.  You deserve it for how much of a fuck up you are.

Knowing your family would be sad if you died, but also knowing they'd probably be relieved too.  Such a worthless thing, finally gone.  Knowing your SO thinks suicide is selfish, but deciding maybe that's for the best, so when you go they can move on easier and finally have a life where they'll be happy without your dead weight.

Being unable to focus on anything.  Knowing you have things to do and feeling growing anxiety from them but being unable to stay on task and get things done.  Feels like trying to walk through a tar pit.

Being irrationally angry at small things, or irrationally fatalistic about mistakes.  Got in an extremely minor fender bender and was 1000% convinced my life was over.  It wasn't, but that doesn't create a frame of reference I can rely on to point out when it happens again.  Even if I do point it out, it's almost like that minor consequence happened to someone else, not me, I deserve the worst.

People always say that the first step to getting better is loving yourself.  I haven't loved myself in decades.  Telling me to love myself when I have a hard time accepting other people's love seems ridiculous and impossible.  So I just hate myself instead, because it's easier and familiar.

I'm in therapy, but I don't see how it's working.  It seems like an hour of me just bitching and I do that enough already.  Probably going to drive away my therapist too, like I'm eventually going to push my SO away with all my negativity.

And above it all, make sure your mask is in place.  Always smiling, always friendly.  Never let them know any of the swirling thoughts in your head.  Nobody wants to shoulder your burdens, not entirely.  The people you trust to do it will eventually get tired of carrying it and just abandon you.  Stay perfect, stay smiling, never let them know, and maybe they won't leave you alone.

So, yeah.  Depression.  Super great.  0/10 would not recommend."
just wondering what's the point?
Not good
Imagine suddenly remembering every single bad thing you’ve ever done all at once. That.
"It's an emotional tug of war in your head. Your constantly wanting to do things but the depression holds you back. Then you have anxiety screaming at you that your incompetent and a loser. It's like if depression where three super buff military guys on one side of the rope and you where pulling the other side by yourself and the drill Sargent is anxiety. 
Not only are you pulling the rope against three guys but imagine there was no stop time except sleep and that's when you get the one on one with the drill Sargent. He's yelling at you about your fears, failures, and disappointments the whole night. So then you don't sleep and you are expected to go back to the tug of war when you wake up. It's exhausting and feels never ending, and medication is like if one less guy was one the other side of the rope and you just don't notice your muscles hurt and the drill Sargent whispers instead of screaming. Your still fighting it you just don't care as much and it's not as difficult. "
"Do you know when it’s really cold outside, and your hands get numb and hard to move? That throughout your whole body."
"So the way Chantix works is it shuts off your nicotine receptors and decreases your urge to smoke. When you don't want to smoke as often and doing so doesn't help your cravings, most times you stop. Depression is like that but for everything you once enjoyed. You're too drained to do anything, and when you work up the energy it isn't fun anymore. So why do anything at all?"
Everything I have to do today is fucking dumb. And I will have to wake up again tomorrow and do all the same dumb shit all over again. It never ends. 
"I don't have it (I don't think), but someone with depression once told me ""depression doesn't mean feeling sad, it means being unable to feel happy."""
"Abstractly: Like your drowning, and everyone around you is breathing underwater just fine. 

Realistically: Exhausting, boring, sad, like you want to die because living life is too much effort. Should I shower? Eh why? I’m just going to lay in bed till I die. Should I eat? Food has no joy or taste why expend the effort? 

Everyone constantly tells you to try but they don’t understand that the mere thought of trying makes you want to sleep, and no part of you wants to try. 

And if you’re like me you’re super lucky /s and antidepressants make you have really bad suicidal thoughts and actions. 

So it’s be depressed and just go through the motions living for other people or get a few hours of happiness and engagement and energy a day in trade of crying and self loathing and trying to talk yourself off a ledge. Added bonus depression likes to bring its cousin anxiety over every day. "
"Imagine standing on the beach, blindfolded. You slowly walk forwards until you reach the water. It licks at your toes and you go further in, until you’re up to your waist. Waves slam against your chest every few seconds. And still you go further. The water closes over the top of your head, and you drown, ever so slowly."
"It feels like despair. But, it's invisible. Invisible, and heavy. Like a giant weight. This thing is bigger than the sun. And heavier. It's in between you, and every other physical thing in existence. And that invisible weight was crushing you.

"
Its like having chronic sadness to the point where you just want to kill yourself.
"It feels ""normal"". Hear me out.

You don't know you are depressed. You ""know"" you are worthless, a loser, lazy, etc. You have always been that way. You can't figure out why everyone around you is so annoyingly perky and happy all the time. 

You don't want to bother anyone with your presence. You find a comfortable spot and just hibernate. This is where you are ""happy"". 

You contemplate life, and realize that there isn't really a point. You've fulfilled your biological function, or maybe never will. You are a tube that takes in food and shits out waste. 

Realizing you are sentient causes anxiety. Why are you sentient, if there's no point to life. That's not fair. You long to just fade away, but something keeps you from ending your own life - you want to see if you're wrong. You hope you're wrong, but you go to sleep every night being ""OK"" with never waking up. Life will move on without you.

(That's how I felt during my last episode. YMMV)"
"""... I'll tell what I think the Bad
Thing is like. To me it's like being completely, totally, utterly
sick. I will try to explain what I mean. Imagine feeling really
sick to your stomach. Almost everyone has felt really sick to
his or her stomach, so everyone knows what it's like: it's less
than fun. OK. OK. But that feeling is localized: it's more or
less just your stomach. Imagine your whole body being sick
like that: your feet. the big muscles in your legs, your collar·
bone. your head, your hair, everything, all just as sick as a

nauseated stomach. Not just your own cells, even, but the e.

bodies, all sick and boiling and hot like maggots in your

-[The Planet Trillaphon As It Stands In Relation To The Bad Thing](https://quomodocumque.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/wallace-amherst_review-the_planet.pdf)"
"Depression is a reality shift in which your world is gone and its replaced by a crushing feeling of hopelessness, guilt and immense feeling of loneliness.    Its very painful, not the nervous system kind of pain but complete mental anguish.    When people are astonished when someone commits suicide and they can't understand how bad things could have been then they have never known the depths of depression.    "
"For me, it feels like everything loses color.

Things that normally make you happy don't interest you.
Being alone all the time feels better than talking to friends.
My diet goes to shit.
I stop exercising.
I usually drink more. 
I beat myself up about every little short coming in my life.
I actually get upset at other people who are visibly happy.
 
I'm a lot better now. But that's how I felt for about 7-8 months after breaking up with my ex. Depression can be different for everyone. I don't have diagnosed clinical depression or anything like that. But that's what it feels like for me."
"Imagine waking up with an overwhelming sense of sadness and you can't figure out why. The fact that you can't explain it makes you frustrated, which makes you feel worse. Your frustration over not being able to get rid of the feeling makes you angry, which leads you to feeling even sadder. It is a vicious cycle that feeds upon itself and compounds the problem."
"The best physical description I've encountered is that it feels like your pockets are stuffed full of rocks. Things just weigh you down.

And that's when things are going well. When you can look at your life and say ""I have a job and a career I like which pays well, my finances are in great shape, and I have an SO in my life I love"".

And when something doesn't go well, when your SO has other ideas about the relationship, when your job suddenly doesn't look so great: the only feeling you have is the sadness, the anger, the anguish or the frustration."
"You don't really understand or appreciate just how depressed you are until you're no longer depressed.

It's like looking down from a vantage point you can suddenly see what was going on or just how severe it was.

"
"Imagine everytime you try to get up, something else is holding you down. It's feels as if some cosmic force is constantly pushing down on you and no matter how hard you try; you can't change it.

This begins to be a daily thing and after so long, you get so used to it that you stop trying. "
This thread is making me wonder if I have depression. 
"Like you're simultaneously going to combust and cease to exist. It is somehow agonizing but also incredibly numbing. It lies to you and says you aren't worth anything and no one loves you, so why try anyway. You lose interest in things you used to enjoy. Even though you still want to enjoy them. It's so overwhelming yet at the same time, it's like being locked in a totally beige room with just this sense of doom looming over you. It's awful. I wouldn't wish it on anyone"
"It feels like having that lead apron that they put on you at the dentist to take x-rays, but all the time. It's a very physical feeling like that. "
"Like you're trapped by your body and thoughts and no longer feel anything including sadness or anger. Standing up, eating, showering, everything is exhausting. You rather just stare at a wall for 8 hours than do anything. People talk about putting a mask on when they wake up everyday, but with depression it feels like you're wearing a skinsuit and all your reactions are faked for others. "
Like the sun isn’t shining even though it’s a bright beautiful day outside
Bojack From Bojack Horseman is the best example I can think of. 
"Literally getting anxiety from reading all these because they are how I feel.
"
"Just imagine being in a cold, dark lake with no one around to bring you out. Being stuck in that lake with a cement block tied to your ankle constantly sinking while you reach for the surface but nobody is there to bring you out. It’s the most horrible thing a person could go through mentally "
"I feel like crumpled up paper. Broken and empty inside. It's like this huge black void that nothing can fill. It's so hard to motivate myself to do anything, I often don't leave the house and I am happy in my misery that way. "
"It's like walking around in your body and seeing out of your eyes but you aren't the one working the controls. Your brain feels like this separate, hostile entity that gets to decide how you feel and how you react. You can be screaming on the inside and wanting to die but on the outside you just look tired. You wake up and the first feeling you have is that somehow, this day is going to be the worst day of your life (even though you thought that about yesterday). It's soul-crushing and horrifying and if you have it, YOU NEED TO SEEK HELP. Don't let it go too far."
"Mild depression is neutrality every day, and some days you get overwhelmed when you think about why you've wasted your life doing nothing, and how your family and people you hold dear will die soon, especially if they're elderly, and you've done nothing to appreciate time with them. The realisation that anyone could die at any time also hits you, and it breaks you inside.

Rarely do I feel emotions more than mild amusement, and most of the happiness I feel feels incredibly detached from myself. It sucks.

Then there are the extreme lows. Quiet points at night when all of a sudden, everything is nothing. That gaping hole in your chest that always ached to be filled with something? You can't feel it. The friends you're texting? Suddenly you're snappy and cold and you can't tell WHY, exactly. When even the void in your heart ceases to exist for that period of time? It's absolutely terrifying because you could probably stand at the edge of a tall structure and feel no fear.

Please, when you get these moments, keep talking to someone, and get them to distract you until it passes. Depression sucks, but we're alive because we're still strong. We have people who really do care, even if we don't think they do."
"Think about it as if you've gone a few days straight without sleeping. You're horribly exhausted and every little thing feels like it takes more energy than you have to do. You're too tired to really want to do anything other thing sleep. You're too tired to really care about anything other than sleep. You can barely think straight some times because you're just so damn tired. Everything is just foggy. Then you go to sleep, and you wake up still feeling like you haven't slept in three days. A kind of exhaustion that no amount of rest can make better."
"If I had to sum it up, it would be feeling that existence itself is exhausting and the only thing you feel most of the time is nothing. And when you don’t feel nothing you feel like shit. 

It makes me feel awful that so many people know what that’s like. I wish you all nothing but the best, and thanks for being able to share those dark feelings, in a weird way, it helps."
"One thing that may not have been mentioned is how sneaky depression is. So many times my depression (which I have named Legion) has convinced me that the thoughts I have - that I am worthless, that everyone hates me.. That these are my own thoughts and thus must be true. I find the road of recovery to be extremely hard and slightly amusing. Imagine a little imp lives in the backpack that you wear, you can never take this backpack off. The imp is constantly whispering into your ear ""noone is going to read what you have written Disney, noone actually cares about you"". When you are at your lowest point the imp is strongest, you take its lies as fact, ""I am a failure, it would hurt everyone less if I died. You dont reeeaaally have depression"". But if you get help, through support or drugs, or whatever quiets the imp. Those lies get quieter, they never leave though. You might think it is a good thing that the imp only whispers now and again. But whispers sound awfully similar to your own thoughts, and the cycle starts again. 

As for the slightly amusing aspect, when I have managed to catch Legion lying to me I get to tell him off for being mean. 

Now that I read that back to myself it probably not all that helpful towards understanding depression. "
"I'm so detached always it seems. I have moments where the monotony of it all is eased somewhat.

But, just imagine the most repetitive, mundane life you can imagine. Get up, drink your morning coffee, get ready, sit at your desk for the entire work day. Go home, eat dinner, and then watch tv till it's time for bed. Sleep for 10 hours because you went to bed early because you had nothing better to do, and because your depressed thoughts of how you should be more adventurous, spend your time being more productive, and how wish you had the drive to push yourself more can be exhausting in and of itself. 

wishing you could get back to being who you were before the depression and anxiety settled in. trying different methods to try and get there, but failing just adding to the feelings of disappoint me you already have about yourself. 

it all feels so very repetitive, mundane, and you just live apathetically.   "

"Its like having a black venom run through your veins, constantlu draining your energy. You're always so  mentally tired you can't be bothered to do anything. Even the stuff you love to do begins to feel like a chore.

An inner voice constantly feeds doubt into you and you become apprehensive about everything. You end up emotionally gaslightibg yourself and have stockholm syndrome to the feeling. Eventually it becomes you."
"aha. I have this since 16 or 17, but with anxiety, for me depression is, feeling so empty for no reason, I cannot figure out what makes me feel shit, i started to have troubles in sleep, i'd wake up in 3 hours even if I am so tired, the things i used to enjoy suddenly becomes not enjoyable anymore, you have a hard time opening up yourself to other people, you may be happy for a moment but then you feel empty/sad again after awhile, you feel no motivation and hopeless, sadness, emptyness EVERY FUCKING DAY"
"Completely exhausting. Jim Carrey put it best, but basically 

“Waking up most days with your mind & body goin NOPE! I don’t wanna be this fucking character today!” - JC
 
Back to the main menu.. Which for me is either trying to get some sleep or sleeping to much, leaving me exhausted from such a random sleep pattern & not wanting to do much more of hardly anything.

JC also saying -

You should think of the word “Depressed” as “Deep- Rest” your body needs to be depressed from this character your trying to play around the everyday overwhelming clamor of life. -

Whether it be clinical or chemical it still sucks & there will be those around you who either just can’t wrap their heads around what your going through or the ones who tend to go ghost from all your constant whining about whats wrong. It might make the situation feel a bit more tragic or leave you feeling alone. Hell it might even weed out the ones you didn’t need in the first place, but There are steps to take to overcome all of this. Like really pushing yourself to get up & do the things you know enjoy, when the real ones invite you out downtown or what not make the effort to go with ‘em to just be around positive vibes. 

ie: hang out with the ones who want you to. Really any form of arts & crafts, whether you paint, draw, knit, make noodle art like a kindergartener, play an instrument JUST DO IT! & exercise, exercise, EXERCISE! 5 minutes the first day, 10min the next & so on! Every little bit helps. Get them positive endorphins flowing.

I have a disfavor for prescription medication & have most of my life been a skeptic on it. There are good ones & the process to find those might be tricky, but trust me they do work in some way or another. Also talking to someone who gets paid to listen.. somehow helps? Not saying you can’t talk a family member either some people just prefer different methods, like, I love talking to my mom who has also battled with this illness, but my brain is sometimes such a mess I just vomit a word salad that’s a bit incomprehensible at times & she gets it, listens, & understands. Just has a hard time keeping up.

Anyway hope this helps ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
& anyone in need of someone I’m here!
WE CAN DO IT!!

TL:DR Depressed & stressed as fuck, but I’m doing what I can to keep the vibes up!
& so can you. I know it sucks, but we all pull through.
Let’s make noodle art together!"
"So when a new depressive episode hits me it's like this:

Imagine you're going about your day and everything is normal, then all the sudden someone comes along and straps lead weights to your arms and legs. You don't want to move because of the difficulty, you feel a lot weaker because of the added weight, and you just want to give up because you can't get the weights off of you. You start obsessing over pretty trivial things, things start feeling more and more far away from you like you're watching a movie of your life instead of being a participant in it, and as a result everything feels less real.

Lots of people describe in as an intense apathy, but for me it's suddenly like everything is way harder but my will to do them hasn't changed accordingly. It takes more focus to do things and as a result you end up sitting around playing video games all day and then you feel bad that you did nothing all day. That makes your ability to focus on things worse; repeat until you want to die."
a bit shit

"While I’ve only had mildish-moderate depression (never long term and never extreme), I will try to answer this question as best I can.

To me, depression feels like you’re having everything you love, whether it’s a friend, a parent, a stuffed animal, a tv show, a video game, a food or activity, lose all meaning. It’s like nothing in the world matters anymore. You sit on your bed, and just cry. You don’t care about anything anymore, and you start to become reckless. Occasionally, you’ll feel small glimmers of happiness. Just enough to keep you going. But then later that day, you feel crushed and broken. It’s like your soul is being pulled out of your body. You no longer feel like an individualized human, but rather a robot. You repeat the same routine every day, in hopes that things might get better. Your life is bland, boring, and it’s like every second you’re alive is a second wasted. You feel like a worthless pile of garbage that will never amount to anything. No matter what people say, you always feel crushed, alone, and like nobody will understand you.

I’m not sure if you’re going through depression, OP, but if you are, know that it will always, always be okay. You’re going to survive it. Coming from a depression survivor, take my word. It’s going to be okay."
"Well, I have mild, ""walking"" depression. I get no satisfaction from anything anymore. I'm always bored, no matter what I do. Things I used to have a passion for are just boring now and I don't want to do them. Every human mind is different, and mental disorders are completely different for every person, and just because some people have the same symptoms, we put them in a group and name it. Depression is different for every person, and I'm not even prepared to put myself in that group. I hate grouping, I'd rather be my own person."
It doesn't.
"It feels like a voice inside your head telling you that your problems will never be resolved, you'll never have the life you want, and that it's just not worth it to keep going on.  Then your brain starts to believe this voice and your body gets tired and doesn't want to move.  It feels like your soul wants to escape and leave your worthless body behind, and there is only one way to achieve that..."
"I currently suffer from depression, but I've managed to make the incidents more controlled than before.  That has taken a lot, by the way, in terms of concentration, meditation and healthy living.

But to frame it in a very real world way, I'll use the example I had two days ago:

I stayed in bed all day.  I called in sick.  I felt completely drained of all energy.  I had no appetite whatsoever.  Every time I got up I felt this horrible feeling in my heart, and it was hard to not focus on the shitty things in life.  Like being rejected, not working a job I wanted, etc.  It's like the opposite of a high.  No euphoria whatsoever.  Nothing seems to matter, either.  You have no motivation to do *anything*.  

It's a really horrible feeling."

Adventures in Depression [Part 2] (https://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/05/depression-part-two.html)

I always felt like this illustration of depression by Allie Brosh on Hyperbole and a Half was especially relate-able. "
"Imagine, one day, you start to slowly lose both your sense of taste and your ability to feel full. Imagine the blandest, most tasteless food you've eaten. Now imagine all food tastes like that, and no matter how much you eat, there's never really any satisfaction from doing it.

Eating becomes work. You like cooking, but as time goes on and the days pass, it becomes harder to cook for yourself. What's the point in adding all these subtle spices and flavours, if none of them change the fact that everything is just a bland mush sliding over your tongue?

So you stop cooking with spices. At least, at first it's spices. Then it's fresh ingredients. Healthy foods. The longer something takes to prepare, the less chance you're going to cook it. You know you should eat better, but it's just not worth the effort. 

You learn to regulate how much you eat even though you can't feel how full you are, but it's more work. Healthy eating habits fall to the wayside, in favor of whatever method takes the least effort, because what's the point? Maybe you just binge until you feel nauseous, maybe you eat the bare minimum to keep you going when you feel faint.

It starts to affect you. Eventually, people take notice. 

Some respond with kindness and sympathy, unhappy that you're not feeling well. Many of them ask the same well-meaning questions: ""Have you tried different spices?"", ""Have you tried new foods?"", ""Is there anything I can do?"". They want to help, but they don't seem understand what you mean when you say ""I can't taste anything, and I can't feel full.""

Some respond with confusion and frustration. ""So, can't you just tell how full you are somehow?"" ""I mean, some things have to taste different to you, don't they?"" ""Well, you know you have to eat, so just eat!""

Some are angry, almost as if your state is a personal affront to them. ""Well, it's not my fault you don't enjoy my cooking!"", ""Just come out to dinner anyways, don't be a loner all the time!"" 

""What's wrong with you?""

It consumes your life. 
You know you'd feel better if you ate better, but it's so much work. 
You hate yourself for knowing you'd feel better if you ate better but refusing to do it.

You go through the motions of eating, hating eating the same bland mush, hating everything about eating, hating that you hate eating. You pretend you're getting better, just so people stop bothering you about it. You exist as a mask covering an empty shell, and that's about it.

You try not to think about how you're losing or worrying the people close to you. You try not to think about how you have no energy anymore, you sit around all day doing just enough to survive. You try not to think about next week, next month, next year. Every day the same. Every day for the rest of your life is this.

And yeah. You probably could go through the motions to keep surviving each day. But if you had to chose between living the rest of your life like this, and not living?

Some people who suffer from this affliction have luck. They have the right situation to deal with it, they go and get help, they manage it, and they keep trucking on through life.

Some people have stubbornness. The try, again and again, to chose not to live, but their survival instincts are too strong, or people care about them too much. They claw their way back up every day, trying as hard as they can because they simply can't fathom doing otherwise.

Some people just don't have either.

Presented with the future of living in suffering, of making the choice each day to either try and muster up an impossible mountain of effort just to feel like a normal person or waste a day as a shadow of themselves, of slowly growing to either be full of hatred or numbness, they choose to take their own lives.

They might go quickly, with a gun or a pill or a jump. They may go painfully, with a knife or a noose. They may go quietly, with a car in a closed garage or slow starvation.

The end result is the same story of tragedy that has happened too many times. An illness unchecked, a person broken, a life lost."
"I don't struggle with depression, I have anxiety really bad though.

It's a problem that's really hard to get a hold of, you're constantly on edge and worried that something bad will happen and logic or facts don't matter. You can't get your mind off of it, you can't stop it and it goes on for days.

It's an overwhelming sense of impending doom and it destroys the quality of your life. You can't enjoy anything, no matter what you do. Nothing feels worthwhile and everything seems pointless. For example, you don't want to go to work or school because it feels like there's no point. 

Medication has been a big help for me. "
"I don't consider myself depressed anymore, but this may be relevant to the period following recovery. I want to destroy everything I've built up in my life, the personality I curate and tend to, partly because being the person I want to be is demanding and i want to go back to when brushing my teeth was an extraordinary accomplishment. Also, wanting to want anything."
"I think it's different for everyone but what I've gone through since middle school (I'm almost 30 now) is something like this:

You want to do something, anything, but you can't muster up the energy to do it. You want to be around your friends, but don't have the energy to have a conversation or even open your mouth to speak, let alone listen to other people talk. You're always tired, no matter how much sleep you get. I could go to bed at 9 pm and still wake up at 2 pm the next day. You're afraid of everything, rejection, being laughed at, or ignored. It's pushing loved ones away and you're not even trying, but you know it's because of you weighing others down. You want to try and mend things with them, but it's too much energy so what's the point? It's wondering what your purpose on this earth even is, and you feel like a complete waste of space. Then anxiety kicks in at 11pm and you start panicking over shit you have absolutely no control over.. or shit you DO have control over but just not right NOW. When and if you begin to feel better and those feelings go away, you get more anxiety because you're afraid those feelings will return, and you don't know when. You just want to feel normal, but you don't even know what that feels like, so you have nothing to compare it to except everyone else around you who seems happy-go-lucky.

Moving around and a change of scenery helps, but your mind always follows. Changing your lifestyle helps a lot, and the people you associate with. I'm a mother to a 9 year old, and I have a puppy. They give me that sense of purpose I need to feel, and my days aren't so dark. I'm still always tired, but I know I will do whatever it takes to make my babies safe and happy. Depression can suck my ass."

"Worse than hell especially when people say they are depressed around you and know they're full horse crap.

You should ask the question how does it feel to want to kill yourself?
If that can be conseptualized maybe a little bit you will still have no idea how it feels too have depression.

And like real depression... Most people who say they have or had depression unconsciously or consciously use depression for attention. And if you asked them if they would or have ever thought of killing themselves they will probably say no its not that bad.

Imagine killing yourself you would have to be a murderer, some things/people in your life fucked with you so seriously and you have no escape know body to release this to no way to express or you don't know how its like i ticking time bomb is inside of you and you just do what you are feeling you should do and lots of people do just kill themselves and lots of people don't realize how mean and cruel people are even if its them being normal. If people knew how it feels to have depression the world would be a kinder place and there would be a lot less shit heads bullying spouses, fake friends, toxic people if they all had the chance to experience what it feels like to want to or almost kill yourself and survive alone and still be alive to tell the story and feel other feelings.

Imagine all your friends family the love of your life the person you love the most other than yourself put you in a 1000' 3x3 hole in the ground and they start shovelling all the dirt back in and burying you alive until the 1000' hole with you at the bottom of it is full. And you are stuck in the bottom no way out no air to breath no space to escape.... and all you wanted the entire time was just a rope or a ladder or anything from anyone to help you escape and get out of the 1000' hole you were thrown in to die. If anyone survives depression like this they are a miracle only something more powerful that we can't see could help save this person when nobody else could or would.

So how do you think it would feel to have depression? "
"The world has no color, no vibrancy, no life. You feel like nothing will ever matter to you again, that motivation is a foreign concept.

Everything you loved is now inconsequential to you. If you didn't wake up tomorrow, you'd be just fine with that.

The despair you feel is physically painful and your mind continuously insists that nothing will ever be right or good or fun again. You'd end it all yourself right then and there if you weren't such a fucking coward.

You hate how much it effects those around you, but at the same time you just don't care. All you want is for this hurt to go away. This ephemeral pain to just cease. Your not sure where you're hurting, just that you are."
You get the sads.
"A feeling of just wanting everything to stop. It is somehow both incredibly boring and overwhelming. Time moves by so fast that I can't remember anything and yet every day seems to drag by. There's nothing to look forward to. No goal seems appealing or achievable.

Also the mental drain. It's like being trapped in a small dark room and having 10 people standing around you in a circle just screaming at the top of their lungs right into your ears. 

You do nothing at all and yet you have no energy or motivation to do anything and what's more is that everything you must do just fills you with dread."
Depressing
"For me at least: Lot of crying, lack of motivation, just overall feeling like shit, and wanting to die.


I can't do anything about it, because I don't have the money, so life sucks. "
That's a question I wish I could ask... 
"A bit late but I'd thought I'd add to this thread. I have bipolar depression and anxiety and sometimes it feels like I'm going crazy. Everything becomes 10 times more difficult or just heavy and I constantly feel like I'm trapped inside my mind. Like everything that is happening outside my body is moving slowly and almost not real, that I'm not really there but inside my head looking through two windows. I'm numb but in constant pain and even the smallest amount of criticism adds to the guilt I feel everyday. I'm afraid of being alone but still seek solitary so others don't see my mask crack, which becomes harder and harder to maintain. I feel like I don't deserve to be happy because I'm just a failure, but can't find any motivation. I'm never content with what I have and it makes me feel awful. I can't even cry anymore just feel empty, and I keep thinking how much better not existing would be, but I can't do that to my family. School is the just torture with anxiety, the constant stress I feel others don't understand because for them it's no big deal. Having no motivation to work harder, but others just see you as lazy so you shouldn't be having a panic attack because you put yourself in this situation. God I could go on and on. What others have written was just amazing. "
"Wanting to die, but feeling guilty for feeling that way. Hating yourself for wanting to die, and hating that you feel too weak to do it. Knowing that your family and friends would be devastated, and feeling like the lowest life for being so selfish. Telling yourself that maybe it really is all in your head, and if it's all in your head and you can't beat it then maybe it's because you just like being that way, or because you're too lazy to do anything about it.

Additionally, feeling nothing whatsoever-a walking void in human form, full of emptiness.

Now switch between those at random."
"When you get lowest grade in class, but that's in life"
"To anyone else who is crushed under the heel of depression, not only are there subs like /r/SuicideWatch, but I have also found great support in /r/NonZeroDay. "
You know when  it's dark out and you see a light in the corner of your eye so you turn to look and as soon as you look in its direction it's gone and there's no reason a light would ever have been shining from that spot? Eventually you stop turning your head
"It's laying in your bed every single day for hours on end knowing that you needed to register for classes for your last credit hours two months ago and find a place to live back in your college town. It's avoiding responsibility because you fucked up something or other that weighs heavily on you and won't ever go away. It's knowing that your financial aid might not come in, but instead of getting it handled months ago, you wait until the week of classes to maybe even considering getting out of bed to solve your problems even though you have to make some sort of payment with money you don't have to avoid your classes getting dropped.

I just don't give a fuck. I want to. I just don't. "

"If you think of life as a race, imagine watching everyone else jogging by in their sporty outfits while you slog through waist deep, shoe sucking mud wearing jeans and carrying a sack of bowling balls."
it's where you'd rather lay in bed and stare at the ceiling than play the video games you loved so much because it's all you care to do anymore 
"I thought I knew what depression was as a teen growing up. I thought it was a bitter feeling of inadequacy, feeling sad and lonely that no one really likes you and you can’t connect with others because you’re too shy and anxious about your own shortcomings. Topped off with frustration and self loathing that you’re such a loser who can’t even interact with other humans properly. I don’t know exactly what you’d call this but I don’t think its depression, other posts here have described depression pretty well."
"You know how it feels to be depressed? Well, imagine *feeling* like that, but without a *reason*. If you are depressed because of a breakup, you can see the possibility of getting past it and changing how you feel (finding a new partner or the fun of haning out with new people you meet while single etc) but clinical depression means there is no reason, nothing to look forward to and nothing to do to make things better. You can't fix anything, because nothing is wrong... then, your brain starts *making up* reasons for how you *feel*. This is where it gets really destructive. Minor issues that everyone has become your brain's scapegoat for how you *feel*. It snowballs from there.

It is like being in a cold dark room. You know there is a heater and a  light in the room, but there is no switch to turn either on. You know there is an issue, but you have no power to change the situation."
"It felt like I didn't have a reason to live.  Completely alone and isolated in my own mind, despite going out, going to work, it all felt empty and a struggle not to just collapse and give up on living.  "

Depressing
Like nothing. Only nothing. 
it depends on if were talking medicated or unmedicated. to me those are two different kinds of depressions
"It’s like piloting a vehicle that automatically scrambles all the controls as soon as you figure out how to not fly it directly into something. 

It’s feeling like you’re annoying or burdensome to the people around you while thinking, “*You* think I’m annoying? Nobody hates me more than *I* do.”

It’s getting little to no fulfillment or reward out of thing you’re passionate about, while being haunted by the ghost of every time you’ve ever failed, made a mistake or had your heart broken.

It’s the monumentally taxing effort of avoiding risk not out of a sense of self betterment, but as bare minimum survivalism. Then allowing yourself to backslide into moral, professional and physical decay when it becomes too exhausting to keep trying."
"There's a [French song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf3EuKKRdY0) that has these great lines (rough translation):

>It's not necessarily misery

>It's not Valmy, not Verdun

>But it's tears in your eyes

>As day dawns, and as it sets"
"For me it was losing interest in everything.  Work, gaming, hunting and fishing and finally golf.  You quickly start asking yourself why you get up in the morning or why you eat or shower or walk your dog because what's the point?  It sucks.  So if you're like me then go get help because, at least not in my experience, will it just go away.  "
"Have you ever been obsessed with efficiency? Imagine you were but you can't find the reason why anything matters. So the most efficient thing is not to do it. Someone said fun is caring too much. The things you are most passionate about are things you care about an irrational amount. The things you enjoy the most, too. You enjoy a video game because you care even though it's just a stupid game. You enjoy facebook even though they're just stupid likes or retweets on twitter that everyone will forget in a minute.

Depression is being unable to care. Nothing gives you even the least amount of satisfaction to accomplish because nothing matters. And you can't convince yourself anything does."
"Waking up every morning and hoping you were still asleep and unaware.  

Laying in bed for hours looking out the window thinking I can just jump , this can all be over. - not contemplating but it would relieve waking up every morning like this 

Still laying there and just wanting to cry but you can’t cry you just sit there with this pain. 

Finally getting up and deciding to take a shower to “get going” and just looking at yourself and seeing yourself as sad tired lifeless.  

You go to the kitchen and open the fridge and start getting something like milk out then saying why should I? I have no will to eat , no will to clean up after myself. So you don’t eat 

Spending all day just just existing , you need to go to the doctor ? Go get the mail? Go grocery shopping?  You aren’t going this messed up shell of a person you now are is going. 

Your partner is sitting with you on the couch and they want to show you something funny they saw on reddit/Facebook and show it to you. - well you look at it and you don’t care it doesn’t amuse you as much as you want to share in your partners positive emotion you can’t. They feel you don’t care. 

At the end of the day your partner is home and starts to make it a point that they are hungry and make food and finally get you to eat it , you eat it and congrats that’s probably your first and last meal of the day since if they didn’t get you to eat you wouldn’t. 

When your partner is sad or something is wrong they look to you for support and comfort. You can’t provide any of that you try to hold them and  tell them it’s all going to be ok. While your doing that you know your lying because you don’t believe that yourself. You feel like you are emotionally stabbing yourself. 

Your in bed and your partner says they don’t know why you want to be with them. That you don’t care about them. You don’t show them affection. They are upset you aren’t having sex with them. Well sucks for you but you have no libido you wish you did.   Sometimes you just agree to have sex and try to show affection in anyway, but you have no energy  the sex is in different you are just doing it because your afraid to lose your relationship. After that you feel like a messed up person for doing that, you walk around your home just wanting it all to end. "
"It is exhausting. You feel everything and nothing all at once, and even the most simple and basic task, like brushing your teeth, drains you."
Not wanting to do anything. Not wanting to be anything. Not wanting to be at all. I don't necessarily want to die. I just want to have never existed.
You are dead but you're still alive
"I always described my mix of anxiety and depression as this one scene of lilo and stitch.  

The scene in particular is the one where Lilo just screams NO over and over while Nani asks 'what do you mean no?! ' For example, you'll just be chilling, feeling fine, and then you'll suddenly be attacked by all of the awful feelings in the world and am being reminded of how your life is worthless and whatever you do us meaningless. So you'll ask yourself 'what the hell is wrong, I was feeling ok! 'And your mind will respond in a neverending chorus of NO NO NOO NOO NO NO no matter what you say. 

Its like dealing with a toddler in your mind. At least, that's what's its like for me when I get the severe overwhelming sensation of depression. 

"
"Waking up and wondering if this day will be any different and if it is, will it be better or worse. If it's better then how come you can't seem to enjoy it, if it's worse then why bother getting up? Seeing people laughing and smiling and ask you feel is emptiness, it's getting asked why you don't smile in pictures when you don't have any reason to smile. Thinking about your dreams and wondering why someone as worthless as you should even bother trying to achieve them. When you do achieve a dream, there's no sudden mood shift, you still feel useless and horrible and empty. People asking you what's wrong all the time. Driving past a bridge and wondering what they fall would feel like. 

All in all it's horrible,empty, and lonely. "
Sad
"Quite depressing, to be honest "
"Dully excruciating.

It's like having a parasite that eats away at every little, tiny piece of you. It starts off small, a bit of apathy here and there, maybe ""feeling out of rhythm"".

But it grows, it consumes every part of you until breathing becomes a hopeless, neverending chore. It turns your blood to lead and your limbs to stone, there's things you want to do but you *can't seem to force yourself to*.

It drains all the color from the world, until everything is one, pitiful shade of grey. It gnaws away at you at the few, sparing moments where you feel something other than numb. And it doesn't stop until nothing is left and everything blurs into one, exhausting chore.

It is debilitating beyond words and poisons you slowly, purposefully. I wouldn't wish it on anyone."
"For me the worst of my symptoms was the feeling of absolute helplessness and hopelessness. Imagine you have a task, it needs to be done in 3 days, its a simple task. You have no idea how to start. You have no idea what to do. You are so emotionally exhausted that you cant even start to think of what you can do for this and nothing feels doable at all"
"First and foremost it's important to realize that it can look and feel very different for different people.  Some people get really sad, others apathetic, still others angry.  This definitely doesn't cover every emotion and many people experience a confusing mixture of these emotions.  

My depression tends to manifest as apathy towards the work I need to do.  This means that during my worst depressive episodes, I often look like I'm having a great time playing video games for 6-8 hours of a day.  This is often followed by or mixed with flashes of anger at myself for not doing anything I need to."

"Think of it like a physical weight literally holding you down, sucking out every bit of energy, and turning every positive thought and action into something that has a hundred downsides. In the worst of it you feel an actual pain, like a mild burn all over your body.

Every bit of advice you're given is useless. Every hand offered to help shouldn't bother. Every love is just a heartbreak waiting to happen. Every joke ends with you being the punchline. Every promotion/raise is just something that happens right before you get fired. Every light an illusion. Every hope a delusion.

That's one day."
"Everything you have to do that you do without a second thought requires you to consciously think and convince yourself, ""I am going to do this now"". Even eating breakfast, putting on clothes, opening your eyes in the morning, showering, brushing your teeth. It's like you can't be bothered to do anything, because you have lost the ability to bother. And when you do eventually manage to force yourself to do anything for any length of time it makes your brain feel like it's frying up inside. "
"Imagine feeling completely and totally apathetic about everything. Well, almost everything.

Imagine constant thoughts of suicide and having the desire to end it all be the only passion you feel capable of.

Then imagine the crippling guilt for even thinking of putting your loved ones through losing you.

Then imagine feeling all of that at once, barely sleeping, overeating and gaining weight because food is only of the only things that brings you temporary pleasure and then hating your reflection because of it.

In this moment as I type this, I want nothing more than to kill myself, but I could never hurt my loved ones like that, and honestly I’m a little scared. The cowardice and guilt is the only thing keeping me here."
"Woo boy it’s my time to shine. 

Most of the time I just feel empty. I don’t want to leave my bed to go to work, shower, eat, or anything. Those anti-depressant commercials are semi true. It always feels there’s a rain cloud over me casting darkness that I see no end to that isn’t an end to myself overall. 

I think about all the dumb shit I’ve done from my early and late teens (I’m only 20) and regret everything. I play it over and over in my head until it’s most likely feels 20000% worse than it actually is.  Or any time I’ve overreacted (even if I’ve apologized and there’s no harsh feelings from the other person). I think about how awful I am because of those things. 

It makes working hard. I am a hard worker by nature but whenever I’m experiencing a low I have a hard time focusing on work at all. I just want to go back to bed and lay down. 

It makes my relationships hard. I want to reach out for help but usually go about it the wrong way and end up retreating back into myself after some seriously uncomfortable conversations. 

I put on a pretty strong front that only a few people have seen past, and that’s usually very rare. I hate asking for help, I feel like I’m a huge burden. 

It also makes it hard to enjoy anything from my hobbies, to relationships (I’m always constantly anxious people are gonna leave me). It sucks. 

It’s always there and it always has been. I’ve been writing suicide letters since I was 15, and have had pretty reckless behavior in the past. While I still think about dying daily, I don’t think I would ever be able to do it myself.

"Its like your mind and body are separate. Everything your mind tries to do, it has to drag the body behind it. Doing even the most simple of things feels like a chore. It makes things not feel real, like this is a terrible dream, yet you are always aware that its reality. There is no incentive to do anything because to you there is no point, nothing brings real satisfaction. Plus your mind feels bare, like its no longer encased and protected by the body, so emotions are effected by things 10x worse. In the times that you feel happy or excited, your body is still there weighing you down, like a rain cloud but right now its only a drizzle. 

Its also different for people who were born this way compared to those who are just going through a depression . Normal people who go through depression, they know what causes it. Relationship ending, getting fired, someone close to them passing, etc. So they know what it feels like to be happy, they always have that as an anchor for recovery. 

However people like me, who were born with their brains not wired correctly, don’t have that anchor. You never get used to it despite your life being this way. You’re always reminded that other people live happy, you don’t understand why you are different and it makes things worse. People don’t understand you, they try to use their own experiences to understand, but its different. They can’t comprehend that there is no reason, no event, nothing that can be talked through. Its your default setting, everything else is temporary. 

I’m not saying people going through a depression don’t have it rough, depression is depression, but hopefully they can see that it can be worse and they can make their way out. For me, the only solution is medication, and personally i found that working out with weights helps a lot."
"Imagine the feeling when you're kept up all night, and try to function the next day. Except that's every day, forever. You're too exhausted to eat, to bathe, to do anything. 

And everyone tells you to suck it up because they're happy why can't you be?"
"Depression is like walking through a labyrinth - most of the time you just keep putting one foot in front of the other with no idea where you are going and when it will end.  Sometimes you come across a window and can bask in the sunlight, but then the sun goes down and you continue trudging along.  Sometimes you run into a dead-end and you just sit down against the wall and think about staying there forever, giving up on looking for an exit."
"You know doing something will help. You know cleaning the appartment, Doing the Laundry, Studying, Making friends, Reading, Working out will help. You know that the only one stopping yourself from being happy and successful is you... yet.. you can't. you sleep in past noon, the dishes pile up, you put off working out another month. You don't make friends or even put yourself in situations to have the potential too. I know these things will help me but why can't I just find the will to do them? Why am I always trapped in a pit of self pity and apathy? Why must I cause myself to be miserable?"
"Exhaustion, disinterest in pretty much everything, forever something causing you to have a pit in your stomach, unable to discern why you don't want to do the things you found enjoyable"
"In addition to credit card, say you use currency/notes. At the end of the day, you bring home change/coins as well as receipts. You throw those coins and receipts on the table and rest for the day. At the end of the week, a normal person tidies up the house and everything gets organized (coins) or thrown away (receipts).   
A person with depression, however, finds it hard to do simple chores around the house for upkeep. What happens? Coins pile up everywhere around the house. Receipts are under the bed, in front of the computer screen, in the bathroom, kitchen, etc.  
Little by little, it adds up. Since the house is already a mess with coins and receipts, the depressed person finds no use to be tidy up anymore. Bottles, cans, sodas line up around the house. The bathroom sink and toilet are orange. The bathtub is clogged. The kitchen is filled to the brim with plastic grocery bags. The floors are sticky and dirty cause they haven't been mopped in months.  
It's a vicious cycle.  
Someone who is severely depressed feels nothing. Sadness comes in from time to time like a tsunami rushing in but most days of the month, there's nothing. No happiness, joy, sadness, anger, etc. It is harder to get up in the morning. It is harder to go to sleep on time. One gets 4-5 hours of sleep per day because of poor self control. Health deteriorates.  
Some people have vices to occupy themselves. Some turn to alcohol. Some to drugs. Some to non stop online gaming well into the night. They will do anything to not think about current/ future plans.  
They drown in their vices until 2 or 3 a.m in the morning. Then, they wake up at 7 to go to work all tired. They come home from work and go for a nap. They wake up and stay til 3 a.m again. Repeat cycle.  
They miss weekday dinners. They miss lunch on weekends.  
Everything is like a long tired dream. That's how depression feels.  "
Obviously I can only speak from my own personal experiences. To me depression feels like I'm tired all the time no matter if I get my 8-9 hours like I'm supposed to. I feel sad all the time and get so low that I can't feel anything except sadness. I feel like I'm riding a wave except there are more pits than crests. I repeat what people have said back to me in my head and the comment that they said becomes judgemental and hurtful. I feel like I annoy everybody even by being in their presence so I try to avoid human interaction as much as possible. When I get stressed I get depressed so often I won't eat and I lose weight and my hair starts falling out. I just feel numb and can never focus on even my favourite things because so much of them lose their purpose to me. I just feel completly disinterested in everything then constantly tired and sad. 
"Suffocating, like you're in a dark room that you can't escape"
Feel?
Feel you're doing the easiest  task wrong. That glass of water you wanted to drink (should've you?) was drank wrong.
"The best way I can describe how I'm currently feeling is just empty.  My mind is a storm but emotionally I am withdrawn. I can only think about what's bothering me, can't relax, can't sleep for more than an hour at a time, haven't eaten a meal yet this week. It's interesting how hard it is to describe something that is so much of who I am right now. I guess when you know, you know. "
Sad
For me I'm at the point where I just want it to all end. On top of depression I have had Crohns disease most of my life which leads to me being isolated and lonely to the point where I want to blow my brains out. I've tried therapy nothing has helped. I just want to not be lonely.
"other users have covered pretty much all the bases, to which i will only add that depression takes away your ability to sit silently in peace, because then the thoughts start coming, and they get louder and louder until your next distraction.  "
Depressing.
And remember all those things you used to do that made you happy?  They don't make you happy anymore. 
"And is not just middle aged people or teenagers that get depressed. It can be anyone.  The school kids on the way to school, the elderly lady, the body builder, the comedian with the eternal smile, the popular musician, your next door neighbour, the policeman etc etc."
[Theres a great lecture by Robert Sapolsky about depression that really helped me understand how it must feel] (https://youtu.be/NOAgplgTxfc)
Depressing
"Imagine the thing you love most in the world. The thing that gives you joy. The thing you live for. Now imagine feeling nothing for it. But you know you should feel something so you try to keep doing it but you just can't feel anything no matter how hard you try. It's like that, for me.

 Having said that, mental illness is different for everyone. And your flavor may vary. "
"i'm just bored, and apathetic most of the time. even when it comes to things i like, i really don't have any enthusiasm for them. i am genuinely confused about how and why people are ever excited for things or disappointed by them, because those emotions are outside of my range. "
"Terrible, but it can't be exaggerated enough. You're just locked inside yourself as the world goes on as normal and all of your emotions are locked up with you. That's been my experience in a nutshell. "
"I suppose if you can get yourself in this mindset that you have no future, youd be better off dead and so would people around you, youre a burden to them, youre just a leech, nobody really loves you, your life doesnt matter and while everyone else around you are making progress and doing something productive and useful, youre simply incapable of doing that, because youre too stupid to know how to be useful, you have failed at some of the most important things in your life even though you gave it your best shot and those failures wont ever leave your mind and you will fail in the future, you will never get the rest you desire no matter how much you sleep, youre a disappointment to everyone around you, to your self and an insult to your family, youre tired, so tired, you dont care about anything anymore; if you get to that kind of mindset (don't) you know what depression for some people would be like.

Im kind of off and on on things, thats why i dont think what i have could be called depression. There are times im really excited like a dog whose owner just came home, those are not too common, there are times i feel neutral, sometimes completely empty and dead inside and sometimes contemplating suicide or fantazicing about my death."
"It's complete detachment from what makes us human. Emotions, traits, humanity etc. It strips you from all that.

Imagine your mind as a bookshelf, each colourful, little book is a part of your personality. They are your feelings, thoughts, ideas. Everything that makes you you. Now, all those books are replaced with copies of one that is bland brown in colour, and all are about negative thoughts. Your diverse collection is gone and everything is replaced by this book. Everytime you visit your little library, you find that you only have this brown book, filled with negative views and ideas to read. For every situation, you can only consult this one little book of despair. Anytime someone tries to peek in, all you can offer is this horrible book.

The book is vile. It is filled with disgusting negativity, self doubt,self hatred. It fragments your imagination, demolishes your emotions, fragments you. Slowly, as time passes, you start to panic. You cry "" I can't keep up with this any longer, I can't be reading the same book all the time, I don't want to only confront things with negativity. I need help getting my old library back."". Sometimes you get help, and you recover. When you don't, odd things start to happen.

You find it hard to imagine a time where your mind was filled with bustling ideas and thoughts. You find it hard to imagine experience any emotion other than what your brown book offers you. You try and reach so hard for all that. You try and reach for new books to add to your library but whatever you do, all you have is that same damn brown book. Then fear strikes, not being able to recover. That fear and frustration turns to anger. Anger against what you used to like. Pure hatred against people you used to be with, emotions you used to feel. You can't get them back, so you start despising the same colourful books that used to be you.

There's a war raging inside you then. Pieces of you wanting your old self back, pieces of you that despises all that, pieces that just want it all to end. You're left in pieces, not being able to form decisions, not being able to live due to conflicting views. In the end, the brown book has won. It has fragmented you. It has defined you.

Here is the lowest point. The suicidal thoughts intrude at this point. They grow stronger and stronger. The urge to end your life and silence your mind. The urge to be free of this war and then, you might act on them. The book has killed you.

The book is Depression. This is the best I could describe having this disease."
I don't want to go see my psychiatrist next because I hate myself and I want to see the worst for myself. So that's something.
"imagine being a world famous chef. you use all these different techniques, spices, meats, etc, then all of the sudden you lose your job and everything tastes like bland mashed potatoes. you slowly use less and less techniques, spices, etc. cause why bother. no matter what you do to it it's still going to taste like bland mashed potatoes. "
"To be honest, I've had it for about 4 years now and I still can't really explain how it feels to me.

I will say it makes me extremely de-motivated and just lack all energy and emotion. You feel like nothing matters and nothing in life will ever matter."
hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2011/10/adventures-in-depression.html
like the electric hum of a light. i read that in a poem before and it’s my favorite way to describe it
"A coworker who had depression described it to me as ""Nothing mattered, you could win the lottery tomorrow and it would feel pointless to you""."
I know that I need to go to cooks. I know that I should be doing my homework. I know that sitting around all day is bad for my health. But somehow none of that will change until I get through depression even though I know what I should be doing. 
"I would describe it as just a numbness, you feel like this completely apathy towards everything. 

You don’t really want to die, it’s just that dying seems easier than living. If you live you have to do things that will bore you and keep adding to that emptiness but if you’re dead you don’t have to do anything anymore and the emptiness is gone.

Anytime you mess up something, even something tiny, there’s gonna be a voice in your head telling you “you’re worthless”, “why even bother when you just fuck everything up?” and if you have friends it’ll tell you that they’re just making themselves feel better socially for being seen with someone that is just a broken mess.

The worst of all though is if you start hoping, if you make plans with someone you see as a good friend and you’re looking forward to it and hoping that maybe you’ll have a good time, but then it all falls through. It’s crushing,  you just die inside and you feel thing overwhelming torrent of misery before going back to the numbness and void."
"It sucks. Sometimes I feel sad with a heavy weight on my chest. Most of the time, I just don't want to do anything. Everything that I have to do is a chore, an extremely hard chore. You sometimes don't even realize you are depressed, because you are still living your life. "
Like shit
It doesn't feel good.
"Some days I think about killing myself, other days I fantasize killing other people, and other days I imagine what it's like to blow up planet earth. All in all, these are just negative intrusive thoughts and don't reflect on reality. Still, I'm quite a misanthrope. "
"Wrote this up for another conversation but it fits perfectly here:

To me depression feels like you are stranded in the middle of an ocean in a storm. You have to keep swimming to stay above the water, but the waves keep coming over your head and you're gasping for air. You're getting tired, exhausted. You're having trouble staying afloat. It's been days and all you want to do is sleep. You start thinking that it's time to give up. If you let yourself sink and hit the ocean floor you will be at rest forever.

I've had low energy/apathetic/confused depression and I have had high energy/sad/impulsive/almost violent depression and both were very different, but they had this feeling in common."
"This probably won't get seen, but I wonder about Anxiety and Depression a lot since I have both. Do you think caveman experienced these types of feelings? Do we feel this way because our society has driven us to feel this way?

 Basically, it seems like a lot of people are affected by mental health. Just makes me wonder if humans always felt this way or is this something fairly new."
"You aren't sad. It's not like a sadness you need to get off your chest but more like you're desperately sick. Think of it like the low mood you get from the worst hangover you've ever had and take away the physical symptoms. Everything inside you feels so desperately wrong and every little thing you have to do is too much for you to possibly deal with. It's not like you don't need to do things like eating and drinking but rather you feel too much like you don't possess the capability to do so. Even worse, you don't care enough about yourself to get up and do it. It's like you blame yourself for causing this grief upon your conscious mind. The empty void in the middle of your chest; just to the right of your heart and inbetween your lungs. This void feels like a hole in your chest but you can feel the blood being painfully drawn from the areas around it, sucking away any possible sense of self preservation. You find yourself questioning why the hell were you born? Maybe you feel like you need to die; your subconscious mind attempting to justify it to your conscious. Maybe you wish you'd never been born at all. It doesn't matter. You're still just as afraid of death as the young woman sitting next to you on the bus or the kid playing in the fountains at the local park. Alas, it draws you in to a feeling of necessity. A necessity to fill the hole. Some fill that hole with various substances, some with food, some with slothful behaviour. You can't do that to yourself. You need to get up out of bed. You need to make yourself breakfast; not shitty junk food but something that will keep you going. You need to go out and get that job, meet up with that friend, go on that date. Against the struggle you've made for yourself; you need to live. Fill that hole the right way."
"Mine was coupled with anxiety so it's a bit of a mixture of the two. 

First is the apathy thing. You stop caring about anything, and it's a near constant experience. You're just numb. 

The second thing which for me was the worst is the self doubt and hatred. I had no self-esteem what so ever. I dreaded every human encounter as I was convinced I would fuck it up. I hated the way I looked without being able to place a finger on why. I became convinced that I was just wrong. This eventually escalated to a point where I could just hear this voice constantly telling me how worthless I am. At first I tried to fight back. Imagine having seemingly two voices in your head at once, one telling you you're worthless and the other crying and screaming at it to shut up. Eventually the latter just stopped and I accepted what the first was saying. Luckily a good friend persuaded me to get help and I'm now recovering. "
"Like the mental exhaustion part of having the flu for way too fucking long, and then it doesn't go away."
"Fucking awful. You feel trapped and you genuinely believe that nothing is gonna be alright ever again and that even if you do manage to be happy again, what's the point because I'll just end up depressed again. You feel hopeless and it can be the smallest thing that sets you off. I've been so depressed before, I couldn't even get myself to move, let alone speak so I spent like an hour, lying in bed crying quietly to myself. I've been in the same room as my best friend and boyfriend, all laughing and have been hit with an over whelming feeling of loneliness and thoughts of ""maybe they don't really like me, they must just be pitying me, who would honestly want to be around me?"".  "
"Like you are stuck underwater and everyone else is breathing & happy and moving and you can see then but they cannot see you or contact you 
"
"It feels like everything is nothing, all the time. Every object, person and place you see just doesn't register. It all looks like meaningless junk cluttering a desk.

You become a pair of eyes and a stomach that needs feeding and a mouth that says whatever canned response will make the person talking to you smile and go away. The inherent meaning that things used to possess disappears and everything starts to look like a boring postcard. Your mind grows numb and your thoughts get dumber and soon you don't even really think of yourself as a person.

It's bad, man, but it can and does get better. Anyone who's struggling, please get help, even if it means talking to a friend."
"Remember when you wanted to play outside as a kid?    
Nice sunny day?   
Then the rain ruined it and you were sad?      
Imagine that everyday and 10x worse."
I can't read this thread cause it'll just make me more depressed smh lmao
"This will probably get buried, but after considering writing a thoughtful response... I don't feel like it. Maybe that is what depression is? I can't say exactly why, it's hard for me to describe. My life is empty no matter what I do, I have to work the majority of the time. I haven't been on time in over a month now, maybe longer, I'm not even sure. I have trouble remembering when things happen, just one of my quirks I guess. 

The stuff that I do at home is easy. I eat frozen dinners for every meal, and watch television or play games until I can fall asleep. When I go to sleep is seemingly random, it is just whatever time I can mentally justify. It's just whether I care about watching the next episode or not getting fired. I'm lucky for the fact my employer is seemingly uncaring about my tardiness at least for the time being, I suppose it helps that we don't have much work right now. 

I feel as if I'm addicted to my free time, but when I have it, I squander it away on doing as little as possible. I have goals, I even have ongoing projects. It's just that everything seems out of reach. Why does it matter if I accomplish anything, if my life will be the same after? For me it is a struggle between pushing myself to try and create the change I believe I need and to just give up entirely. I don't want to kill myself, but thinking ""if only I were hit by a bus"" happens almost daily.

I don't think this answers much, maybe it will help provide a glimpse at depression for those who are curious though. It is certainly more than I intended to write."
"Every little thing feels like you have to climb a mountain to get there, even getting out of bed. And I desperately want to talk to someone, but it feels so hard to get myself to do that sometimes. If it gets really bad (which thankfully hasn't been this way in 5+ years) it feels like I'm just watching myself go about my day without really being connected to my body. At the time I had no idea that was linked to depression, but I learned that more recently. I also have horrible anxiety, but when I'm depressed it's like I can't even care enough to get anxious about my worst fears. It's been a long road but I'm thankful I have the support I do and that I got help. It took me a long time to actually get help, so if you are suffering, please reach out to someone, even feel free to send me a message."
"For its something like this: take your TV outside in the cold. Then turn down the colors to about half. Put enough hats that you can just barely hear the sound. Then play a video about your life at 1.5x speed, all the while wishing you were inside with everyone. Nobody want to be outside. You're the only one outside. Nobody realizes you're outside looking in to your own life"
"It feels like being stuck underwater with weights strapped to all my limbs and chest. Some days the water is calm and I can just float through, some days are more stormy and the horrible chest aching feeling from depression hits in waves. 

Either way it's like being stuck behind a glass barrier and everybody else is on the other side. It's suffocating."
"there's just... a void, you know? where there should be something, there's nothing.

a lack of feeling, you know?  i'll sit for hours in an uncomfortable position, and it doesn't quite register that something's wrong. my flat is a tip and i know i should do something about it but i just... don't.

each hour feels like an eternity, yet a week can pass before you know it."
">How does it feel to have depression?

That's just it. You don't feel *anything*. "
"Imagine you are watching a movie. There are happy parts and sad parts. Maybe it makes you cry. This is normal.

As you're watching though, the picture quality starts to degrade. Things lose color. The audio starts to sound weird. It gets harder and harder to process what is happening in the movie anymore, much less relate to the story. Eventually all that's left is a low, buzzing, moaning static."
It feels like everything is terrible and nothing is going to get better. Even when things do get better - even when things are downright *good* - it still feels like everything is terrible and nothing is going to get better.
"If you are super depressed do you think you would ""snap out of it"" during a significant event?  Kid about to be ran over by semi truck, alien encounter, terrorist attack, Hawaiin missle alert?  "
"It is like you are treading water with 3 layers of clothes on and everyone you know is on a boat around you. They can't see you that you are drowning they just think you are swimming and occasionally they will call out to check on you. You don't ever get enough air to tell them you need help. When you do get enough air you don't want to bother them with it. They are all having so much fun on the boat. You think they wouldn't notice if you just stopped treading, maybe they would be happier that way anyways."
"I've suffered with depression and it's just awful. You just.. can't see the positive side of anything. I was depressed in school because of constant bullying for 5 continuous years, and I thought more about how I could kill myself easily than what work I should be doing at school. 

I didn't think about anything positive, because I couldn't find anything positive. I couldn't even laugh at how pathetic I thought I was, I couldn't even find one tiny upside to a horrible downside and make one, tiny, sarcastic joke. 

You think ""why am I even here?"" and you go through in your head everything that you've ever fucked up, ever done wrong, ever..considered even attempting. Introversion is the best thing in your mind, other people don't want or need to see this, because I know what they think - they think i'm pathetic. 

One of the worst parts of having real depression as a teenager is your awful, neglectful parents just think you're being angsty. I hated them so much because they did so little and I couldn't even summon the strength to tell them how I felt. "
That's really gd.
bad
"Do you know what the most boring, miserable day is like?  You know that feeling you get as the seconds tick away slowly, your soul itself turning gray on account of how miserably non-descript everything is?

Okay.  That feeling is how you felt when *you were happiest you've ever been in your life.*

Also, it feels like a thunderstorm is happening inside your head, with lightning striking inside your brain several times a second.  You're exhausted and can't sleep.  You have a dull ache all over, the kind of ache you get when you slept on something wrong, but it's your whole body.

You are perpetually alone.  It doesn't matter how much company you physically have.  You are *alone*.  Forever.  You're in a dark pit that nobody else can even enter.

You don't want to do anything.  You just want to lie in bed, not sleeping, maybe mindlessly surfing the Internet, maybe just staring at the ceiling.  It's all you can do.

The most complex thought you can form is ""Fuck shit,"" because it contains the only two words you *can* think.  Any other words are beyond you.  

And it will be this way forever.  There is no hope.  There is no light at the end of the tunnel.

That's what depression is like."
Depressing 
"I find it a lot harder to describe how it feels now that I’m not struggling, but this journal entry from when I was extremely depressed shows how it feels pretty damn well in my opinion. 
“Right now I just feel so broken, like a completely shattered shell of a human being. All I am anymore is sad. I am not emcheese22. I barely even remember that lively, selfless girl. She shows up every once in a while, but I don’t even recognize her when she does. Depression has taken away every ounce of who I was. It left a mess who can’t find a reason to get an assignment done or eat dinner or get out of bed. All it wants to do is cease to exist because living is so exhausting. Every single breath I take is a struggle and with each exhale, I feel as if I rid myself of another reason to continue. I just want to be done feeling so broken, so isolated, so empty. But even if I were to survive long enough to rid myself of this, I don’t even know who I am without this crippling sadness”"
"It feels like nothing in the world matters to you, It feels like you are wothless, And an appetite loss"
Depressing 
"I want to sleep...

I hate sleeping. I hate wasting time. I hate doing nothing.

Depression makes me want to do all of those things, because what reason do I have to do anything else?"
"I think depression is rarely alone an only the one who suffers it know what it means, thou language is pale to describe its shades. 
There's always other underlying issues.
 And apathy, lack of interests in instrascendent motivations, and social stablished normalily, might be a complete different subject.
I'm 50 and I'm depressive (now I know) since I can remember. My most used sentence when I learned to speak was ""I'm sad"".
Also now the Asperger syndrome is a big gray area, with some relative importance only in children, the rest of us are left to oblivion."
put a serious tag on this ASAP. I really don't want to see jokes in this thread 
Shitty. Really shitty. 
"It's the epitome of self loathing. You hate yourself for not adapting to the world but you hate the world for not understanding. When you reach out to explain or ask for help you're made to feel like you're the enemy. Like you're wrong for simply feeling. So you don't want to feel anymore. Everything you feel is wrong, or painful. Everyone you love or want close seems to slip away as you try not to bring them down with you or they get angry and you push them away. Sometimes you'll get a glimpse of happiness or a distraction from your hatred of what you've become. But it's fleeting. As soon as you feel happy you realize that you've been down for a few days, or a week, or longer.. when was the last time you felt that simple feeling of a smile not forced? Has this episode really been a whole week? Now that time is gone and you try to move forward, pick up all your baggage and hope you don't need help carrying it, or you'll slip right back into that pit of hate you keep buried inside yourself.. most people with depression hide it. We don't you to know how miserable we are. We don't want to burden you. We just wish we knew what was wrong with ourselves..."
"It's like you exist but it wouldn't really bother you if you didn't. You wouldn't go out of your way to end it cuz that's just too much effort. And you really can't put in any effort. Like wearing this really warm jacket under the hot sun and sweating your ass off but not having the energy to take it off so you can be comfortable and just breathe. And all the while you wonder how people can't see how that jacket is killing you. You try to tell people about it and they ask if you hate it so much, why don't you just take the jacket off? So you try to explain but it doesn't make sense, even to you. So you stop saying anything and hope the jacket will just consume you whole at some point so you don't have to do the things you need to do everyday ."
"It’s like wearing a big, heavy, damp, blanket like a cloak, everything is harder to do and you always feel uncomfortable and ugly. You get so tired that things that used to be fun is a hastle and exausting. Nothing feels worth doing. Its boring, hard to get well from and fucking sucks."
"I don't know about other people, but my depression was mostly manifested after I made any sort of mistake. Screwing up something put me into this endless loop of ""worthless"", ""kill yourself"", etc. This lasted until I went to sleep, completely writing off a whole day."
"Wife and stay at home mom. I'm terribly in love with my husband, adore my children. But when I go through a case of depression I can't feel those things. Pretty much my reason for existing and what my entire life revolves around and I can't feel it. Those good feels you get for random reasons?Yummy food, good beat on a song, warm sunshine on your face. The little things that can make you smile, right? Don't feel it. All day every day is just waiting to go back to sleep. I KNOW I'm missing out on it. I KNOW what happiness is but can't seem to reach it. Like missing out on something really important and being utterly distraught by it but you just gotta deal with it. "
"Feeling like it wouldn't be so bad if the world suddenly ended, or some disaster suddenly happened. Apathy towards life in general. Forgetting how to be active and happy. Sleeping for 15 hours and still feeling dead tired. Lying in bed staring vacantly at the ceiling and vaguely wanting to not exist."
"There's a lot of shitty, fucked up things in the world. Mainly, we survive by ignoring it all. Depression feels like that filter got flipped around."
"Wanting to be gone, to not exist, to be dead or disappeared or whatever that isn't your current point of physical existence."
"like you constantly have a heavy wet blanket on you, and your insides feel just as heavy, and things never get better and your brain permanently sees the pessimistic side of things. A prisoner of your own mind. You miss a LOT of possible opportunities as well. It fucking sucks. "
"It's a little different for everyone. I've talked with other people about depression and some of their symptoms match mine and some of them don't. I don't actually know if i have depression because I've never gotten a full diagnosis and seeing that i'm unemployed without insurance, it's likely that i'll never get that diagnosis.

But everything is a chore. Walking to the bathroom is a chore. Walking to the kitchen is a chore. Making food is a chore. Running errands is a chore. Waking up in the morning is a chore. Everything you have to do requires energy that you just don't have. It's not always sadness, it's mostly just constant never ending lethargy. Even after getting out of bed and starting my day, it takes me hours to wake up, sometimes i don't even feel awake until after everyone's gone to bed. You start to avoid doing things, even things you love to do, because you just don't have the dedication to complete it. So you start to feel like a disappointment, which demotivates you even more and makes you feel like a bigger dissapointment. You can't get comfortable, ever. Sitting down, standing up, lying down, you never comfortable, ever. Everything aches at all times. And to top that all of, almost everyone thinks it's your fault. ""If you just did this"", ""if you'd just stop being lazy"", ""if you actually tried"", ""if you would just get over it"", all of which just sends you in deeper because now your disappointment in yourself is validated by your peers.  It's a never ending self feeding loop of self loathing, lethargy and demotivation. "
"Hopeless, dark, scarey, sick, painful, apathetic, physically painful, sleeping too much or too little, no interest in anything, lost, alone.
But believe or not there are cures and you can get better."
Very depressing
"The other day I was sad. All day I was sad, like my dog had just died sad. My mom, dad, and my sister kept asking me what's wrong and I always said idk. The truth was, I really didn't. I was just so sad and so down all day and I had no idea why. It was the worst feeling because I was sad and down and I had no way of fixing it because I didn't know what was causing it. "
Tired and heavy all the time.
you feel like nothing you do is good enough
It doesnt
It doesnt
"Wow, so many of you really need to consider doing poetry."
"- You have a lack of energy.

- You seldom smile. You're usually apathetic, sad, or angry.

- You get disappointed easily.

- People don't want to be around you, because you're a sad sack.

- You have few to no friends. It's hard to maintain relationships.

- You don't feel good about yourself like you're worth much of anything.

- You think about suicide as a way out.
"
Quite depressing
"Okay, ready?

Imagine you're on a bus. People get on and off again without looking at you, or making eye contact. They are happily chatting with each other, but you're basically invisible to them. If you try to join their conversation, they give you a dirty look and move away. Outside the bus, everything passes by in a blur. It's raining and gloomy outside, and you don't want to get off the bus because it's cold and wet out there. You're indecisive because while the weather is awful, you also don't feel welcome amongst the other passengers. The problem is you can't remember where you're supposed to get off, so you just don't, but you continue to feel terrible for being there at all because you're taking up space another passenger could be occupying. Your emotions fluctuate between mild sadness, fear, and annoyance, or a mixture of the three. Mostly, you just feel emptiness and nothing else. You're stuck there and you can't make a decision. Now imagine this goes on forever. That's depression.

Your entire life is basically the same shitty day that never ends. You feel isolated and burdensome to the people around you. Nothing brings you any joy and you're never truly happy. The best days are the ones where you feel slightly less like a useless sack of fat, but they are few and far between. Everything is a monumental effort; making decisions, being productive, etc. Sometimes, there are days when getting off the couch to pee is so exhausting you spend an hour trying to summon the energy to walk to the bathroom, and you need a nap afterward. You feel listless and bored but you can't find anything that helps you feel better. Nothing inspires you. Nothing even registers. Your house could suddenly burst into flame and you'd just sigh and go back to staring at the wall, waiting to burn.

This is not an exaggeration in the slightest. You're on that bus until the ride finally ends, and you're so alone there's no real way to even begin to describe it with words. You wish you could die just by thinking about it hard enough, but then again, if that was even possible, you probably couldn't be bothered to try. It is literally a complete and total flatline without enthusiasm, excitement, or even disappointment, and it's forever because you can't afford the appointments and medications that could help, and there's too much expensive trial-and-error to go through to get to the other side.

On top of all of this, when you hit rock bottom, and you feel the absolute worst you ever feel, time seems to slow down, so you're trapped in that place inside your head for what seems like centuries, and there is no escape."
"The best metaphor I heard was ""Imagine literally everything you ate tasted like mashed potatoes"". No matter what's put in front of you, how it looks or what's in it, in your mouth it has the taste and texture of unsalted, unbuttered mashed potatoes. 

Every single day that's all you can eat. Maybe you can tough it out for a little while, or force yourself on a lot of days to get up and feed yourself regardless. But bit by bit it just keeps wearing you down and never gets any better. 

How excited are you going to be for any given meal? 

[Also, this sequence seemed pretty relevant too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P4_E3GhUv8)"
"Physically, it feels like looking as high as you can and forcibly closing your mouth.

The soreness in your neck is probably just manifested stress."
"Add in anxiety about an event that hasn't happened yet. Logically you KNOW that it's silly to over think on something. But, then you end up being flooded with a shit ton of ""What if's!"" and they're never the good kind either. "
bad.
"You wake up feel nothing, empty. You go back to sleep. You wake up you eat, wishing you would choke to death on whatever your eating. You go back to sleep, accidentally choke on your vomit. Wake up in a panic, decide death by choking is not the way to go. You dream about being useful, turns into a nightmare about how much of a worthless fuck up you are. Weeks go by, family and friends avoid you because well, your not fun to be around.  You sleep. You wallow in how lonely you are and how no one really gives a fuck about you. Months go by, you think about suicide but the suicide hotline told you to wait 24 hours before doing anything. You sleep. You never get out of depression because your always putting off suicide.  Your overweight and in poor hygiene, you feel shitty about your worthless self image. You sleep. Finally you say fuck it, quit drinking, smoking weed, popping pills, and smoking cigs. You sleep. You go through withdrawals that make depression look like child’s play. You sleep, you cry, you eat. A month goes by and you feel better, still a bit numb to everything but you haven’t felt any emotion, but now you feel hope. You change more, your diet, your routine. You sleep less. You go outside. You talk to people. A year goes by, you reflect on it, and realize life ain’t so bad. But in the back of your mind, your greatest fear is feeling depressed again. You sleep, normally...

That’s how it was for me anyways."
"Nothing is exciting. You'll say phrases a person would say without any feeling behind it. Even if you end up doing what makes you happy, you'll come to find that there was no point to it. Every second of life is a black void you'll never see and end too. Then when you're about to end ot all... Something will stop you and then you'll feel worse because you can't even go through with that. Then after that hopefully you come to your senses and seek some help."
"everything is just so slow. you want to be around people but dont want to talk about anything. you want to be alone but feel lonely. you dont want to do anything, and you arent even thinking about procrastinating, you just dont want to move. one time i stayed in bed for 30+ hours, didnt get up for water or food or use the bathroom, just stayed in bed awake."
"Everything is foggy, everything takes a great effort. Trapped in your own thoughts. Try to forget them only to have them come back with a vengeance. Don't really feel like eating even when you are hungry. Always tired. Always sleepy. Not being able to sleep. It fucking sucks. "
"“Whenever I was asked what I wanted my first impulse was to answer ""Nothing.""
The thought went through my mind that it didn't make any difference, that nothing was going to make me happy.” 
― Osamu Dazai (No Longer Human)

In my experience, it’s like having a hole that can never be filled.
I feel dreadfully lonely even if I’m surrounded by people, I hate everything about myself more than anyone/anything else, I’m absolutely exhausted even though all I’ve done that day is lay in bed.
It feels like the weight of the world is on my shoulders anytime I have to get out of bed just to use the bathroom.
My eyes are sore because I’m just so tired, and I want to go back to sleep, even though I just woke up.
It’s feeling like I want to cry, constantly, but I’m just too numb to.
It’s having to keep a bottle of water and a bag of chips near my bed at all times, just so I don’t waste away.

It’s having things that make you happy, but not having the motivation to do them. Even if it’s just watching a tv show, it feels like the hardest thing to do just to pay attention. It’s knowing that laying in bed all day staring at a wall is a waste of my time, but just not being able to bring myself to care.

It’s not necessarily being suicidal, I don’t truly want to die, but it’s just not wanting to feel like this anymore. So heavy and dreadful and so full of just...emptiness. An emptiness you know will never go away.
It’s something I wouldn’t wish upon anyone."
"I have a slightly different take on this. I have depressive episodes as a part of being bi-polar. This means that my symptoms are 90% physical. Lethargy, loss appetite, trouble remembering things, low sex-drive, etc. For me being depressed feels like having been up for 48 hours, no matter how many hours you spend in bed. "
I’ve had depression since I was about 12 or 13 right when I started puberty it kinda kicked into gear. I’ve been on the bring of ending things many times. For me it’s the feeling of missing a piece of me. Like there’s an empty part of me that is gone. That cannot come back. A loneliness that radiates an impending doom. It’s the feeling when you see a depressing photograph. But instead of just having that feeling for one instance it’s all the time. I fight with it all the time. And I know I’m on the losing end of it. 
"Like a weight on your chest constantly pushing your breath out. This is weirdly specific but y’know when you go to the dentist and they have you close around the suction thing and you feel all your air just kind of get sucked out?

That’s what it feels like. All the time.

When it’s bad, I feel like I want to scream and literally tear my chest open but it just doesn’t help. You feel literally trapped. "
"Pretty much as a result of my problems, I am unable to feel better. So I keep telling myself each day how I want to kill myself, despite how I would very likely never actually attempt suicide."
feel sad every time
"It's when you answer ""no"" to the questions about having depression and suicide in the doctors office because you don't want to inconvenience anybody "
"Like drowning, like becoming more and more desperate for air and becoming frustrated and then panicked when you can’t just take a deep breathe. Like being trapped below the surface watching everything, everyone pass by. And wondering why you just can’t get it together and just break through. Meanwhile you have no interest in eating, showering, interacting. It’s just too exhaustive. And finally you get a tiny taste of that sweet oxygen only to slip back further. Sometimes your able to surpress the depression, push the darkness into the box, lock it up and move on. Sometimes, it creeps out, engulfing you. Slowly suffocating you again. "
https://i.imgur.com/jtW2VGH.jpg
"When I was dealing with it I lost all interest in things I used to love. I got no enjoyment from books, games, movies, anything really. I couldn't focus at work and I just had a sense of hopeless despair. Each day I looked forward to just going to sleep so time would pass by more quickly and I wouldn't have to be conscious for it. It was honestly the most terrible time of my life."
"Depression is like being lost.

Imagine you're hiking deep in the forest, everything is going pretty well and it's beautiful out. You've seen lots of cool stuff and took some amazing pictures to show your family when you get back. This trip is going pretty well. 

Then all of a sudden you realize you have no idea where you are, and your map is gone _""Where am I?""_ you might wonder, _""How did I lose my map, it was in my backpack!?""_ but it's no use. You're lost, you don't know where you are anymore and it's getting cold out. The sun is going down, you're feeling helpless and scared. You're alone and miles away from home and you don't even know the direction.

You pull out your phone _""Maybe there's some signal and I can get help""_ you think, nope. Not only is there no signal, your phones completely dead. So you set up camp, you don't have much food left but maybe it's enough to survive...if you're lucky

_""Maybe someone will send help?...No of course they won't, they don't know where I am...I may as well just give up. I can't even remember what home feels like anymore...""_ you think, feeling more and more defeated by the minute. 

You're alone, lost, scared, helpless, and out of energy. You don't know where the trial is and even if you did at this point you're too physically and mentally exhausted to walk back to it. This is surely where you'll die. 

That's what depression feels like.



>Hopefully I'm not too late to this thread to contribute"
"It feels like carrying a big weight on your chest. You stop enjoying and doing all the things you used to. Your steps feel heavy and everything is a chose. You feel indifferent about life and death, and just hope to fade away. Everything you ever did wrong replays in your head over and over again. Nights are difficult because of an overwhelming feeling of guilt. You feel completely worthless, like you are simply taking up space in this world. You could be loved by many, praised by your co-workers, and still feel the same. Anxiety sometimes follows depression, which is a fear that there are more bad things coming your way because you are damned to suffer in life."
There is a really good BoJack Horseman episode about this and when I go through depression (mine comes and goes in phases) it's exactly how I feel. [Here is the episode and specific scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGalix-sVXs)
"For me, I don't understand what it's like to not have depression.

Every little mistake I do is amplified tenfold easily. I constantly feel like I'm either terrible at doing things or just a terrible person and I have to constantly remind myself that things are not as bad as I'm viewing them. That alone gives me near 0 energy to deal with anything else. Clean the house? Forget it, I'm too tired. Get up to go to work? Wait until last minute because I'm too comfy and/or tired. Eat food? What can I mindlessly toss into the oven and set a timer for so its minimal effort, even then, thats too much some days."
"When literally everything goes wrong, even if it's supposed to be simple. This can last from days to months"
"Like you weigh a million pounds and to even lift an arm is incredibly difficult, let alone make yourself get up in the morning, have a social life, have the will to live"
"Trying to think about the future feels like trying to look through a brick wall.
It’s like waiting for the credits to show up on a boring movie, but the movie just keeps going on and on. 
For me this feels like I would truly prefer non-existence, but I don’t want to suicide because of the pain it would leave my friends and family. It’s like if there was a button I could press that would change reality so that I was never born, I’d press it without hesitation (most days). 

Then you’ll get a week or so of feeling better and you think you might be able to get yourself out of this rut.

Then it comes back and the cycle continues.

Source: struggling with depression and anxiety for around 7 years. Been to therapy and have tried meds, but for me the best way to feel better is by increasing my neurogenesis by either using a supplement or doing cardio exercise (hard to motivate to do exercise when you’re depressed).

Edit: also days and weeks start to blend into each other.  It’s hard to remember if I showered this morning, yesterday, or the day before. "
Bad
"Imagine riding a bicycle uphill. It's tough, and your muscles burn a bit but the sun is shining and the sky is blue. The place you're going is good, and you're looking forward to it. It may be an uphill ride, but you like your bicycle and you know you'll be glad to get off and lock it to the bike rack. 

I don't get that. The weather sucks, the bike is broken and I hate it, and the place I'm going is nothing more than an obligation. And it's uphill all the way. That's depression. "
"When it gets really intense It's like having a 24 Mega Ton Nuclear attack missile helicopter gunship with with the most horrific and disgusting weapons on board that you cannot even begin to imagine their power and ability to crush your mind under their weight. Its like staring death in the face for every moment of every waking hour and having to choose between death and life in every one of those moments. To stare death in the face for even one of those moments is a, no THE most revolting experience I can tell you. "
Despair. Hopelessness. Pain. Guilt. Fear. Dread. Isolation. Punishment. 
Having no motivation for anything. It feels like things never get better.
"For me i dont really notice it, it becomes the status quo and feels ‘normal’ for my wife she says i am lethargic and irritable, and stop doing even slacking off activities, like playing video games or watching tv seems like too much work and is no longer entertaining or fun"
"Imagine your at your most tiredness. 
Thats all day long, not interested in tv, your loved ones, eating, work, all you want to do is sleep"
Just empty your skull of anything remotely positive for months at a time. Realise that all of your efforts are entirely futile and everything you or anyone else cares about does not matter. Hell I just want to kms right now trying to describe this to you. Anyone else just see themselves and everyone else as filthy self-serving disgusting monkeys most of the time?
"It's like trying to swim in liquid concrete. Breathing is hard. Thinking is hard. Everything is grey, useless, worthless, boring. Food tastes like nothing. All you can do is sleep. Sometimes even getting up is too much. It's not a great sadness, it's more of a great ""meh""."
It feels like Bojack Horseman
"I wake up and feel like nothing. I don’t have the ambition each day that I used to. I wasn’t always like this. I have a family to live for, but I have to remind myself of that daily. Definitely something I want to get past, and I feel for others dealing with this."
ive always described it as my emotions suffocating themselves 
"I'm late, but I'll answer this the best I can.

It fucking sucks. It feels like you have zero hope left in the world, as if everything is numb. If you can manage to get out of bed in the morning, you move about your life as if nothing is wrong, but you'll rarely feel a thing. 

Thoughts? Good luck. Most of what runs through your head is caused by the wonderful co-captain of depression is anxious thoughts. Makes you wonder why you did a certain thing that way, making your depression even worse. Sometimes you'll end up thinking about the future and how much of a failure you believe you are. 

You mostly just want to sleep. It's hard to eat, drink, or do anything to keep yourself going; and it's near impossible for someone to get you out of it, for a momentary lapse of feeling ""normal"". 

You'll be constantly chasing this idea of being normal, whether it's substance abuse (drugs and alcohol. I would occasionally smoke a bowl to get myself to feel something other than **numb**), therapy, or trying your damnest to hide the feelings on the inside as well as the outside to not let it show that something is wrong.

It's a lot of fucking work and it is ***harder than hell*** to deal with on a daily basis. And it's made even harder when our society continues to look down on you for being depressed and the media portrays it as ""have you tried being happy?"" which does nothing for the most part but piss you off. 

It's lack of understand and compassion from those around you, even family members. People will claim they know what your going through, and try to help you, but do nothing but make the entire situation worse. They think you're just upset because you think nobody cares about you. While that is part of the fun of being depressed, that's not the only thing going on, and someone showing fake compassion won't work. 

Recovery is a mountain climb larger than that of Kilimanjaro, one slip, one false step and you lose a lot of progress very, very quickly. It's not an overnight change. It's weeks, months, or in most cases years of therapy, medication, and mental gymnastics to get yourself better. It's a job that only you can do and you boss is the monster you are facing every day.

The way it was described to me by my therapist that started making my recovery easier was ""It's like a game of tug-of-war with a monster that is a million times larger than you. And what happens when you try to fight it? You'll lose every time. You cannot beat it if you are actively trying to beat it. The only way you will beat it is if you stop fighting it and accept that it is a part of who **you** are. It is your daily struggle. You don't want it to win, and you don't want that monster knowing what your are going to do next. You drop the rope and just walk away from it."" That was after six months of ACT Behavioral Therapy (not for everyone, if your psychologist is a good doctor, they will be able to find something that'll work for you). 

My best advice if you or someone you know is suffering from depression is this - no one is going to make you get better, not even your therapist. Your therapist is only your guide on this journey. The only person that will make you get better is **YOU**. You are the master of your fate, and the captain of your soul. You have to be the change you want to see in yourself."
"Everything you used to like and enjoy becomes feels pointless and like a waste of time. You don't really feel any strong emotions. Well, a better way to put it is that emotions you have feel very muted. You also get tired a lot.

More severe forms you'll sometimes feel body aches, intense sadness, etc. I had this type in my teen years. It was awful. Now I'm more of the above."
"You feel no enjoyment from your favourite activities. You hate feeling alone but being alone is all you want, because you don't want to inflict your mood on anyone. Sleep makes it easier but you feel bad for not being productive. You feel numb, you wish when you fall asleep you won't wake up, but when you do wake up you go through it all again. "
"My depression isnt really that bad, so i dont really ever have those moments of ""I want to die"", i have moments where i think that, but i never actually consider it as a valid option.

But anyways, its kind of like you are constantly tired emotionally, every day when depressed it feels like every task takes more effort, and is always a struggle to even get started."
"Physically, you know that residual feeling you have after a good cry? It feels like that. Often I've sat around feeling like I've just cried really hard, but I actually haven't. I wonder what's wrong with me, and the answer is simple: that's depression. 

"
"This is depression for me.

You wake up and you are tired, you have things you want to do but they are just out of reach, you are never happy just have moments of happiness, life is a dull gray the majority of the time. AND when you finally get to a point were everything is actually okay, you cant enjoy it because you are stuck in your head wondering when its going to go back downhill again.

It effects my motivation, my interaction, and overall life. Not to mention the chronic pain I'm in that just contributes to it."
"Feeling hopeless, worthless, and wanting to die. "
"You're not doing anything, but you're exhausted.  You spend all day in bed and literally can barely get motivated to drink water.  Little things like showering, brushing your teeth, etc. sound impossible, but you also hate yourself for not being able to do something so fucking simple.

Then other people say ""just do it, you'll feel better, it's not like you're running a marathon"" and call you lazy and it makes everything worse. "
Crippling 
"Fuck. I thought my depression was bad but it's pretty light conpared to some of the people on here. 

PS- I'm not trying to act like I'm better. Just being thankful that I'm not at the point of considering suicide"
"Terribly late to this thread but I have a super relevant link! I don't have depression but a friend of mine does, one time when I asked him what it was like he told me to read this. It's kinda long but definitely worth it, made it make a lot more sense to me. http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.ca/2011/10/adventures-in-depression.html?m=1
I think there might be a second part, not totally sure if it's included in this link but shouldn't be hard to find."
"Like everything around you is moving, but you're not. Everyone is improving, but you're stuck in the same rut you've always been in. If time could freeze, it'd be the most wonderful gift in the world."
"Like there's nothing left for me anymore.  I feel like a total failure, incappable of holding a relationship.

But hey. No one shit in my cereal today. "
Pretty rad
"In my case, it feels difficult to breathe in the way that it's bothersome that I have to and each breath I take leaves me in regret somehow. Existing is a bother."
"I wouldn't categorize my feelings in the same boat as some posters here, as my feelings are motivated from a recent seperation.. but: truly feeling empty. Looking right through everything around you, and the entire world feels like its operating in black and white. Trying to fill the massive void with people, things, or feelings and halfway through just thinking about trying to get back the only thing you actually want."
People ask you what's wrong and there's no real answer it's just a state of mind. It comes in waves. Unable to see any positives especially in the future.
It's horrible. Being able to take care of yourself (showering for example) is very tough.
"What type of depression?  A short term bout of depression sucks but it passes.  Dysthymia or long term depression is devastating.  If you have never suffered from it, I'll have a rough time sharing my experience with you. 

Depression kills you a thousand times every day you live with it.  The high emotional affect is horrible.  You start feeling parallels in every thing that is miserable in the world with your situation...your fucked up brain will gladly use external misery to add it to your internal one.  

The anhedonia is the real killer.  A lack of pleasure.  Depression fucks with your brain's reward system so the things you like won't make you feel as good as before. The very things that you could count on to help you endure, no longer click as much as before.  Food, drink, sex and I imagine (never used them) drugs, no longer produce a good pleasurable response.  

The ennui or apathy also fucks you over.  Not only are you miserable, you also don't give a damn.  This kills you in subtle ways.  You won't think you are worth it, so why bother in education, you'll always be mediocre or a failure.  Your wings will never carry you as high as they could.  Ugly, disgusting, repulsive, sad sack, why even bother with a romantic partner. Nobody will give you the time of day. So just live in your cave, masturbating, that's all you deserve anyway.  

You'll suffer cognitive degeneration.  The thoughts you have will be stupider or less worthwhile.  Navel-gazing all the time, you'll barely form valuable insights.  

Then comes the suicidal ideation.  If you have a little self-awareness, you will realize that having to live with that enormous pile of shit is not mandatory.  You'll start looking at high places, highway crossings, bottles of antifreeze differently.  Fantasizing, building elaborate scenarios where your loved ones will find your body.  If you are like me and do not want your loved ones to grieve, you will plan to minute detail where, when and how.  This will never leave you.  It is at this point when you are in the most danger.  

If you get therapy, expect to spend months taking SSRIs, anxiolytics, relaxants (so you can sleep) with so many side-effects that depression will feel as a nice alternative. Expect to lose appetite, libido, the ability to sleep more than 2 or 3 hours a day during this phase.  Also the bills.  

As a last insult, many people don't consider mental disease a real thing so they will offer moronic and patronizing advice.  You will come to hate some of them.  Maybe even wish they had the permanent mental broken leg you have to give them a little perspective.  

Depression sucks and I wouldn't wish it to my worst enemy.  It has given me plenty of perspective, I tell you what."
Oh shit I just realized that I'm in depression (I'm not kidding) I thought that was maturity or some shit like that 
"Nothing really seems worth doing. You rarely smile or laugh unless you're intoxicated. Everyday you're just going thru the motions trying to make it until bedtime without breaking down/falling apart. You replay every mistake you've made and criticize yourself for them, regardless of how you handled the mistake at the the time. No matter how much effort you put in to bring yourself out of it, you just can't seem to move forward, which is very discouraging, until you finally give up and accept that your life sucks and there's really nothing you can do about it. You stop caring about stuff because its just too much and you're often overwhelmed by day to day life. There's a constant sense of foreboding that you can't identify or escape. Eventually you start longing for death, just to get some relief from this shit existence. Therapy is only available if you can pay for it."
"Time didn't have meaning, you realized this and its scary. Neither do the people you know, have meaning, because you realize they hand their own lives apart from you, which eventually ends in death, so what the point in living? Just to die in the end. . . Except your too afraid to die so you eat something, a little something but that just causes more work and the possibility of human interaction-people talking at you, pointless conversation.
 What does it matter how my day is? Or the weather, you'll be dead in 50 years so what's the point?"
It feels like a living death. There is no joy. 
"Sleeping is the only thing to look forward to. It's the only activity you can partially enjoy. Even then, it's not enjoyment - it's just more misery, lying there with your painful thoughts. But at least nothing else is asked of you. Your bed is like your little miserable nest.

There is no such thing as feeling happy or excited about something. At best, you feel a cessation of misery - blankness. It's like you took your TV screen and turned down all the sound and all the colour settings until the picture just became a dreary, droning annoyance in the background."
It doesn't.
"How does it feel?

It doesn't. And thats what I have the hardest time trying to describe to people."
"You know that feeling when you just want to go home? It's like that but you're already home, so you can't go home to feel better. So you just feel like you don't belong anywhere and can't go anywhere to feel better."
Feels bad man
Depressing
"Empty. You don't want to fo anything, you don't enjoy anything you enjoyed before or in general at all. The first thought after waking up - why didn't i die while sleeping. You blame yourself for everything and the only thing preventing you from taking your kife is knowledge of what it will do with the ones who loved you. Panic, it comes out of nowhere and makes you KNOW you're going to die NOW. Someone chuckled - what's wrong with my appearance? Or something else? You try to talk with someone aaaand there you are apologizing for everything. The worst part is people not understanding that it's really a very serious problem. Also you are very good at acting normal, so no one is going to help simply because they don't know you need help."
"My doc describes it as ""being angry, but without enthusiasm"". It's like having every negative emotion at once, but without any energy behind it. "
"You feel empty inside. You don't even have the motivation to get up and end your fucking misery.

And sometimes you get bursts of energy that, when mixed with the constant shitty feeling and lingering sadness, can leave you looking up ways to kill yourself and thinking about if you should or not.

You'll be overthinking everything, too, because you need to prove that you're worthless. You think that everything you do is a mistake, or that you fucked it up, and you're sorry, you're so sorry, please don't yell or get mad, it was a mistake.

You won't want people to care about you. It makes you feel bad when they do, because why do they care about someone who isn't worth the effort and the time?"
"It feels like you're constantly being crushed, and all the weight of the world is on your shoulders. You really don't feel like doing anything, even the things you used to love. "
At 15 it is the worst feeling of your life. Everyday no matter what you do there is always that little voice in your head that tells you that you are worthless. Ever get a bad grade and not care too much? With depression it hits you so hard that you just bottle up for the rest of the day.
I would suggest visiting r/depression. Plenty of insight. 
Hmm best way I can put it is like being 5 steps behind everything. I'm speaking physical for now but basicly your body feels like it's constantly weighed down. The mental feelings vary from person to person for me it's a sense of being lost or out of place no matter where I am.
"For me, it truly feels like I just don’t care anymore. Nothing makes me feel anything. I don’t look forward to anything or try because what does it all matter, I’m going to die eventually. Telling myself I’m a loser because I’m not acting like everyone else. Just curling up into my own bubble and wallowing.

It can vary in presentation in each person, though.

shite

"i dont feel anything at those times. Not happiness, sadness, anger.. nothing. Its just empty. I dont feel like doing anything, and would rather starve than go to the store. Im not suicidal, but were always thinking ""if I die now it would be ok."" I knew the world wasnt better without me, and that I had things to live for.. I just didnt feel it. "
Really glad this thread exists
"     Answering this feels really vulnerable since I suffer from depression. 
     However, I will say that it’s the most suffocating, controlling, abusive mistress you could ever imagine. She makes you feel numb for long periods of time, and then out of nowhere you feel every single emotional blow that has led you to this moment. You don’t wish to eat, sleep, breathe... but you have to for those you love. Suicide isn’t the answer because you know that it’s “just depression” that is making you this way. There must be something that will fix this. So you try medication to no avail. You go to counseling, and it takes many years to find one that Vibes with you, and makes you feel safe talking to them. You feel like everything negative in your relationship is your fault if you’re lucky enough to have a partner. (I do.) You fear you will one day be left by them once they’ve had enough of your numbness & severe pain that ebbs & flows like the ocean at high tide. Every breath you take is like climbing a mountain, equally as difficult & terrifying to some. It doesn’t end, until it does. You find the right counselor, the right medication, the right partner... Then and only then does it become easier & possible to heal. You can’t do it alone. 
    If you are dealing with this, stranger, I hope that you come out the other side surrounded by love. I hope you realize that love has been there the whole time, and it brings tears to your eyes when you finally feel better. Because there is hope. You can’t ever give up no matter how hard it is. Keep fighting. You are worth fighting for."
"It's like being stuck in a dark hole, you keep wanting to climb out and get away from that miserable dark hole but you can't, the walls are too high and are made of slippery mud.

So most of the time you sit there, alone, sad, wishing you could get out, wishing someone would notice and throw down a rope or a ladder. Sometimes you struggle, maybe if you try really hard you can climb out, nope... you slide back down and you sit there alone. It's the last place you want to be bit it's where you are."
"To me, everything feels like your watching the same movie over and over again. When you finish a movie, whats the last thing you want to do? Watch that movie again. You feel that same feeling everytime you do anything. Basicly, your brain stops chemically rewarding you for things."
"You can't try something new, as you are most likely to fuck up, and as a consequence, you become trapped in this ""zone"" where you want to do something, be something, or change your life, but you tell yourself ""no, I'm going to fail, why bother, I'll never be as good as other people"". This has happened to me, as I'm constantly trying to pursue hobbies, and study in order to get a good life, but I just can't. In my mind, everything I do is pointless. ""If you're going to die, why bother. Keep your procrastinating, anxious, useless lifestyle"". Why do something, when it's harder than doing nothing?

I've never had any talents. I failed music class on middle school, I was good at sports, but since my decay on exercise, I was too scared of looking odd. A face standing out in the crowd. I tried drawing. I wasn't happy with how I drew. I wasn't happy with my life. I still have enough years of my life to give a 180º turn to my life. But, I can't do it. I just can't. My mind knows I won't be able to do it. Even though I have a girlfriend, and wonderful friends, I just can't seem to get the motivation in order to get my life right. I'm not happy with my current lifestyle, but I also don't want to change it. It is the worst feeling I've ever had in a long, long time. 

Source: I have depression "
"The best description I have from my experience with it is ""you're sad, but have no reason for being sad, which makes you sad."""
"I’ve always considered myself a happy person, Love life and never had issues, but reading these, I do all of these things myself. Kinda made me think"
depressing 
"I've been depressed before and it's basically being numb and indifferent to everything. It's when you can't get through little tasks. There have been days where I showered and didn't even realize it because I was going through the motions without realizing it. Absolute auto-pilot/survival mode. 

There's this idea that depression = sadness. In a way, yes it can be. If I feel strongly negative emotions, I can be depressed. But to me, true depression is when you stop caring about everything. You lose all hope, all will to try anything, and feel worthless. So, sadness is almost less worrying... when you stop *feeling* is when it's the absolute scariest. 

My worst periods of depression were when I wanted to die because I felt no connection to anything nor anyone anymore. It's crazy to think about, because I am usually a very passionate person... so depression is always very evident in me and others notice it. "
Like being stuck in a time loop.
"For me it's the lack of emotion. I don't care about good or bad. I'm literally trying to get through the day so I can sleep. And sleep anytime in between. No desire to better myself. No fight in me. Like I could walk in on my spouse cheating on me and lay down and sleep beside them. It's despair and lack of hope. No wants, no needs, no anything. "
Imagine working at tech support for Comcast and actually having empathy for customers issues. But because of everyone’s profound hate for your company everyone treats you like crap even when your doing your best to help them. And when they fill out your survey at the end of the call someone try’s to give you a 10 but it gives you a 1 cause the system is screwed up and you have to explain that to your boss. 
"Everything has a somewhat dreamlike quality. Like I feel happy sometimes, but it's a very shallow feeling that seems disconnected from my actually conscious."
"I have had a few low moments the past 2 weeks as I am recovering from surgery. I have cried allot. I didn't want to get out of bed. Nothing brought me joy. I was just waiting to go to sleep as dreams could sometimes be interesting. The days dragged. I ate loads some days and other days I didn't want to eat a thing. I wondered why I was here. I hated myself. I tried to find something fun to watch, I couldn't be bothered with my favourite films. I have mostly snapped out of it now though."
Suffocation
"This is a longshot, and I'm so late that this is likely to get buried. But I'm wondering if any other depressed people have felt the same way.

One thing that haunts me is the fact that I've had a really good life. And nothing truly traumatizing has ever happened to me that I know of. I'm 31 and I still have all my grandparents. Never had any close family die or any friends. I've always felt like I've been too ""lucky"" so far and something bad has to be down the road. I know we all have our struggles, but I look at other people and I just feel incredibly lucky. Then I wonder if depression is the something bad I've always been worried about."
"You feel isolated, after a while it’s hard to go into public without the constant feeling of not belonging. Over time you will feel that same thing with family. You end up feeling so lonely and during this part, it is almost impossible to vent your feelings with someone else because you feel like a burden. "
"Depends on the person and it doesn't have to be things like sadness or low-self-esteem or whatever.

It can also be stuff like having no energy, so you're tired all the time and have a hard time mustering up the motivation to do something.

It can be feeling apathy towards a lot of things or having a hard time appreciating things.

Maybe you have trouble relaxing since your mind constantly wanders at high speeds which makes it hard to get into a moment even if it requires your full attention. Like maybe you've been in an accident and injured or others are injured and need your help and even though you're doing everything you can to help you're wondering what you'll eat for dinner today... or maybe you finally managed to get close to your big crush and are about to share an intimate moment, but you can't stop thinking about how you still have to drop by a gas station later on, need to pick up stuff at the grocery store and hope your favorite youtuber uploads a new video today.

Basically you have a hard time being ""in the moment.""

Emotions can feel kind of weak and distant or simply aren't there the same way they might use to be, which relates to the apathy.

Depersonalitaion or derrealization (did I spell these right?) can also follow, the feeling of reality seeming like a dream, or forgetting you exist... like you're in a group of people and others are talking so you delegate yourself to a silent observer and kind of forget that you're there, it's like watching a video."
"No matter how much you sleep, you're still desperately tired. You don't feel like you have enough energy for anything. Literally. Not even to brush or wash your hair. Literally standing up feels like an impossible task. Add anxiety to it and it's a whole new kind of torture. "
For me it's my conscious constantly telling me how useless I am or what I'll never do and just pack of motivation and hope 
"I basically spiral at night thinking that I'm worthless and will probably end up broke, miserable and alone. In the daytime, I have a clearer head, but still assume that people don't like me or that I'm being used for some reason not clear to me yet. I think my anxiety feeds into my depression at night and vice versa in the morning."
"You know those toddler toys that run on batteries, the ones that you can press buttons and they speak?

A few hours before they run down completely, they start making the toy run weird. It will slow down or speed up, start responding when you aren’t pressing buttons or not responding when you are pressing buttons. 

That’s like depression. Your body and mind won’t respond to normal situations properly."
"God it sucks. Like, I just physically wouldn't have the energy to do anything. Acting like it isn't happening is draining, the only way I can fall asleep when it gets bad is to just pass out since I couldn't do it on my own. My food intake drops to maybe a poptart once a day, while I normally can demolish three loaded plates at a buffet. Hygiene goes out the window. Bathing once every 3-4 days was the norm. Like, genetically I got a pretty raw deal from my parents, but the depression is just the worst."
"I've gotten much better this year.

I went to the gym today. 

Walking home felt like so much effort that I literally thought I'd rather die on the spot."
It feels like its just a fancy word for feeling bummed out.
Everything sucks and it is hard to be happy. You lack motivation to do stuff.
"Absolutely horrific. 

Depression for me was no energy, no motivations, and no self worth. 

I couldn't see why people would like me, so I stopped hanging out with them and then they wouldn't want to hang out with me. 

I spent years just sleeping all the time.

But at my lowest point, I was trying to make an effort. I tried sewing, I tried working out, I tried cooking. I hated all of them. But now, nearly 2 years on I love sewing, working out, cooking, reading, hanging out with friends etc. 

Depression feels like the darkest hole ever, but it really can get better."
I don't want to talk about it...
I like to explain it as everything seems like it takes the effort of climbing a mountain. Even something as mundane as getting out of bed.
"You lose motivation for everything, and nothing matters. You just want to disconnect from the world and rest in peace. You feel hopeless because you realize your mentality yet cannot find any strength."
It's awful. It like a half life. You wake up and you want to do things and you objectively understand the mechanics but you just can't. Sometimes it's like I'm just watching helplessly as my life just passes me by. 
When you don't even have the motivation to get treated because it feels like too much trouble.
Feeling trapped. 
"Hell on Earth. I'd rather be physically tortured and know that some time  I'm gonna be fine again, then to have pain in my heart all the time because of existential thoughts and not seeing any hope for the far future."
"Imagine you are in a box with a cage on the top. Its filling with water, and you cant fit your head through the bars, your friends and family are standing on top of the cage telling you to drink the water to keep it from filling up. But you cant.  Every once in a while something will happen that drops the water level by a foot, but it always creeps back up until its just barely above your head. Just enough to suck air through the bars through your nose, while you drink the water, hoping for it to go down."
Crippling.
Depressing
You can explain the concept of feeling no physical pain by feeling numb.  You can't really explain the concept of feeling no emotions. Depression is undescribable for someone who doesn't have it.
This thread helped me realize I am nowhere near depressed. 
"Like you’re being enveloped by a quicksand of apathy which will drag you down until you can see no joy in the world and can take no pleasure from things you’d normally enjoy. 

You feel as though you’re stuck and that there is no way out, nowhere left to turn.

Thankfully, speaking from experience, things always get better and there’s always support out there through friends, family, co-workers, pets or professionals. Don’t be ashamed of your route to feeling more like yourself."
Depressing
It's something that is easier to fall into instead of confront. It becomes your shadow and somehow will always find its way into your everyday thought. You grow so used to it that it becomes your default.
"Anxiety and depression seem to be different sides of the same coin. 

But depression is existing and not living; moving but not motivated. It's a lack of hope. Living in the present is difficult, but the future is bleak too. It seems in part from repressed anger, but I have yet to explore this avenue. "
"I wish every single person read this thread, people seem to not realize how hard it is and how impossible simple things become. NO, its not easy and medications or filling your time with random stuff doesnt work, it can work for a certain amount of time but that doesnt magically cure your depression. I just wish everyone would understand me and I wouldnt have to live this fake like every single day. I hate people, hate my life and hate myself, thinking about depression is horrible and pleasuring at the same time... No, I dont want to be this way forever, would love to love everything and everyone, specially myself but its not easy in the slightest. People dont undersand that and never will..."
"You feel like you're not in control of yourself. There's no one behind the wheel. Being miserable turns you into an asshole, just like the bullying victim becomes the bully. You hate yourself, but you just can't seem to change the things you hate about yourself."
Depressing
"The feeling of absolute despair, apathy, and dread all at once, coming from nowhere, and ending at nowhere."
"If it goes unchecked it can ruin your life.  I don't want to sound like I'm blaming all my problems on depression instead of my own judgement and decision making, but they kind of go hand in hand.

I've been fired 3 times in the past 6 months.  I hate working so much that I  can't even put forth the effort to not be late several times a week.  My room and my car ar an absolute wreck, full of food wrappers and cigarette butts.  I'm not disabled, I know how to clean, I just don't care.  It feels like some kind of MC Escher painting where I keep going down and down and down but somehow stay on the same level. 

I don't even enjoy my interests anymore.  I used to escape in games and music but it's all just white noise now.  Shit, even drinking doesn't help like it used to.  My personality is eroding away, I'm basically just a person shaped hole in the universe that just sits stagnant and hates everything.

My life is a complete and utter mess and I have no one but myself to blame.  I used to think that self awareness was the hard part to improving, but I'm well aware of how useless I am and take literally zero measures to do anything about it."
"Mine feels like a fog falls over me. So thick I can't see anything in front of me, just this fog. Try to function while it's there but any little thing will set me off into a fit of worthlessness. The worst part: the only way out is through. I have to just survive it and hope to have a break between now and next time."
"You know when you're at a restaurant and you put lemon in your water? And then you get a refill, and you can't taste the lemon any more? It's like that. "
"For me, it's a constant battle of knowing that nothing matters and not wanting to fuck up the prison I've created in my mind I see as reality. "
It doesn’t. 
"- Get naked, go outside, lie on the pavement, and let me drag you for eternity without stopping.

Pretty shitty.
Sad
"Yesterday I got promoted at work to a different department (from customer helpdesk to internal IT systems support). I interviewed for the position a month ago, then did some shadowing on the department yesterday. Got called into the manager's office at the end of it and offered the job. I'm clearly capable of doing the job, absolutely aced the interview and got on very well with the others on the department while I was there.

I'm currently anxious as all shit because I haven't had a letter of confirmation, despite the fact that I know the IT manager has already had a meeting with my current manager to try and negotiate my notice period down as short as possible, and I literally was only offered the job yesterday. I feel like I've somehow lied my way into this and they're going to find out what a worthless piece of shit I am and keep me stuck in call centre hell where I belong. The fact that I feel like this makes me think that this is what I get for putting effort into something, it's all going to fuck up anyway, I should have just kept my head down and done the bare minimum, at least my rent gets paid right?

And that's why I'm still awake in the middle of the early hours reading Reddit on my phone instead of sleeping like people. Well this time at least."
Like you're slowly dying of sadness.
When you're tired of living and you're done with it. The past 25 years were great but I've had enough of life. There is no future. So tired.
"Well for me I haven't left my house in months. I don't enjoy doing anything and nothing makes me happy. I am completely unmotivated. I basically spend my days on my bed watching YouTube and crying. It's hell. I often think about suicide but I have a beautiful wife and two sweet children who I just couldn't do it to. So I'm stuck in a life that I don't like and get nothing out of. I'm just wasting my days away being idle, being useless. I'm a failure to my wife my children and myself."
This is simultaneously the most comforting and depressing thread I've seen in years.
"This spoken word poem has always been accurate of my experience.

"Almost exactly like the Dementors from the Harry Potter series. 

JK Rowling got the inspiration from depression itself: they feed on vitality, draw strength from your body, they are neither dead or alive, dark and veiled*, they turn the surrounding environment cold and unfamiliar, anyone can be their target especially those closest to you--in fact you can feel both like their victims and sometimes like the Dementor itself. 

*During depression if feels like your not looking at the world with clarity but rather foggy and blurred as though looking through a veil on front of your face. "
Depression can feel like a cloud. 
"You're playing a video game. A dialogue choice comes up. Of the three choices, one would obviously benefit you, one wouldn't change much, and one would cause a disadvantage for you.

Right before you hit the button to select the beneficial choice, all of them swap places, making you pick one of the others.

You don't really ever feel in control of yourself."
Like putting my car in for a wash and detail and getting it back with a broken windscreen
It's like a dark cloud in your mind. It makes it so you can't enjoy anything. 
"This is Depression: 
I am tempted not to write tonight. I am tempted to break my vow to write every day. My vow to just sculpt and sculpt, to lose track of perfection, to let go of precision, just to touch the clay and hold it and mold it and stroke it and bend it and pat it into a shape that may not be compelling, and which would certainly dissolve in the rain outside that is leaking and dripping and shaping everything into soggy mush. If I stood outside, I would dissolve into mush too. I am not much here. I am but a thin ceramic shell, millennia old, carrying odd remnants of the faintest strands of haunting tunes, murmured words too soft to take shape. My back is bowed with boulders, branches, and bracken, arcing into a down-bending curve, creaking, popping, as my dim eyes traverse the wet mossy ground just a breath from my face, my back bowed and breaking. The moss reaches up to me with its small waving tendrils of green earthy green, drowning in raindrops, awash in raindrops, drunk with raindrops, delirious with rain while I cry and cry and feel the rain melt me, pelt me, and my fragile shell dissolves into the moss that cries with joyful welcome. The boulders and branches and bracken push down my shoulders as I crack and shatter onto the soggy ground, and my mind splinters into gleaming fragments of floating memory that softly rise on the breeze and sail to lands unknown and times un-clocked. And I am one with the earth and my roots are deep and I sleep, and I sleep, I deeply sleep. "

"I felt like it was nothing. The lack of feeling, feeling nothing, a complete void. When I was depressed nothing could bring joy, or sadness, or anger. I felt nothing at all. "
"Jobs or activities that healthy people would find easy or acceptable to complete each day become more tiring, so they're harder to complete.

Take your job, eating routine or exercise routine, and imagine it's 30% more tiring. That means 30% more draining in your energy, 30% more strain on your muscles, 30% more energy needed to focus. That's close to what it feels like to do the same thing while depressed.

This is difficult for others to understand because they're unable to empathise, and depressed people themselves are very aware that they should be able to do this job like others but can't, so it perpetuates a cycle of self-doubt."
"There are some fantastic descriptions on here so I just wanted to add a small bit. When I was going through this my friend gave me a link to a comic and it nailed everything on the head for me. It was great to find something that I could relate to. Here it is here:

"first its hard.
you usally stop taking care of yourself depending on how depressed you are
wich means youre gonna stop taking showers
stpp eating, stop wanting to go outside or with friends. you are mostly just gonna want to stay in bed all day and not do anything about it even whem you know yoi are slowly ruining your life
depressed isnt just sad. you can be sad you can have a lacl of emotions too. sometime you can end up being suicidal. its really bad. and at some point with living with depression you realize its not that you are always sad. its that you are sick in your head. you are living with slmething in your head tha brings you doen everyday everytime. its painful and sometime its so painful you think ending your life is the best option to stop fealing the pain. and youll realize that you will affect people around you. wich is gonna make you feel way worst.

thats my point of view of me living with my depression."
It sucks because one day I care about something and the next I just don’t have the energy to care
"So using a throwaway as this could actually come back to haunt me.  Anyhow, here you go.

Before I get started I do want to say I haven't been formally diagnosed save for my GP saying I should probably be on some SSRIs or some such,  but I feel given my state it's applicable.

For me depression is effectively the inability to do.  As in the lack of any sort of motivation to perform the activities I used to, and still do though to a lesser degree, enjoy or the activities I have a responsibility to finish.  

At the moment I lack the drive one would normally find to go out and do the things they love, it's just not there, that first step is just too onerous.  If I manage to get past that I still enjoy the things I used to at least to some degree, games, reading, wargaming, etc, but the vast majority of the time I can't get past that initial lack of motivation.

Furthermore I find that it's getting harder and harder to actively perform the responsibilities I have largely due to the same reason.  I'm finding procrastination to be all encompassing at this point, and it's honestly becoming a huge hindrance as there are some things I really need to do, and I know I could with ease, I just cannot bring myself to take the first step.

For me it's effectively no longer being able to find the energy that one would through their day to pursue self improvement, to act as they should, to have fun with friends or alone.  It's a crushing weight that just pins me down and is day by day getting to the point where I'm not entirely sure there won't come a day when I simply won't be able to get myself up to go to work, or I'll miss a deadline because I can't be fucked to care.

And it's horrible, because I can watch it happening and fully process the consequences of it but I can't DO anything about it.  For me it's the situation I find myself in, not necessarily a chemical imbalance though that may also be the case at this point.  Isolation, loneliness, watching my support network not give the slightest of fucks the one time I turn to them for honest help regardless of the help I've given in the past.  It's the perfect storm of context to drive me into a hole that may pass in about 7 months or may get much, much deeper.

Anyhow.  I hope I've helped illuminate the topic for you a little, though as I said I don't know if I perfectly qualify to answer given that lack of a formal diagnoses.  "
I got so depressed I actually felt removed from my body. Like I would lay in bed and then I would drift up and see myself there
"Like fighting a constant war against yourself. When you do try to correct your own shitty thoughts about yourself, there’s always that loud voice in your head telling you that you’re a terrible person, that everything is horrible and there’s nothing you can do about it. It’s thinking people are crazy and that they must be wrong whenever someone sees the good in you. It’s blaming yourself for the smallest things, even those that are out of your control or are actually someone else’s fault, and feeling the need to apologize all the time. 

And most of the time, you’ve been that way for so long that your perspective is blurred and you don’t know how to convince yourself that it’s the depression talking, not reality. I’ve been struggling with it for years and am trying like hell to fight it. "
It doesn't feel.
How does it feel? It doesn't.
There's no proper way of explaining it.
"Nothing. You feel empty. Everything, even breathing, even just laying in bed, is too much, too much effort. It doesn’t feel like anything. You can’t feel anything. If you’re crying, you don’t know why. All things seem pointless. Any laughter is fleeting. It’s just empty empty empty."
"Like nothing and everything, all at once. "
"I'm gonna go honest here, and do a stream of conscious response. And, I promise you, there is no reason to be worried about me. But, if there is a reason to be worried about you, it's more than alright to let someone know, anyone know, because sadly enough, it's kind of normal and necessary to have someone worry about you. 

For me, I don't know. It doesn't feel like anything. Nothing feels like anything. I pop on Youtube clips, usually something familiar like a stand up bit I love, or maybe something on Netflix or Hulu, something I've seen a thousand times before, and I let it play. And play. And play. Or I switch. And let it play. And kind of take it apart as it's playing, looking for the spark of the thing that made me cry, or laugh, or swoon. I play my guitar. And it sounds like a bunch of chords, one after the other, that I remember being a song I like. And I play the chords a bunch of times, waiting for that part to connect, and remembering that it had before, or hoping that I wasn't faking it so well the last time that I even fooled myself. And then there is a glimmer of a feeling that comes from that line of thinking, but it's mostly second-hand fear, standing next to me, telling me I've probably been faking it the whole time, and probably won't be able to anymore. So I get in my car, and I drive around, and find menial tasks like grocery shopping, or time consumers like an afternoon movie, and it all comes across like an adult in a Charlie Brown cartoon. 

And then it's night time, so I drink. And I get another lightening bug of an emotion, and it's fear standing next to me again, letting me know it's probably too much drinking, and my diet, and lack of exercise, and lack of ambition is a choice, because, Doritos and the couch, and XBox. I used to double down on the drinking, but now, that doesn't do much. Doesn't really hide anything. And it's not as fun as it used to be. There isn't anyone around that I know.

And at some point it is time to go to bed. And, for me, that question of suicide, but not a suicidal thought, instead, just actual thoughts about suicide. Like how can someone do that? How do they have the energy? How do they care that much? And I get a tinge of the fear, not that I want to kill myself, but that maybe people don't mean to, and maybe autopilot is like a first step towards it. So I shake that off by flipping through Youtube videos, but at this point it's something I hate, like cringe compilations, or Gavin Mciness rants. 

And sooner or later it's Tuesday, or Sunday, or Wednesday, and this fucking sandwich tastes really great, and that episode blew my mind, and kissing my girlfriend makes me want to rip her clothes off, and I think I know the next note I want to add, and... "
Deadlly 
"- Lying awake in bed with your eyes burning from exhaustion, but you're not comfortable enough to relax and fall asleep.

- Swimming in open water, but the land you see never gets closer.

- Every task is a chore met with dread.

- Even the most perfect and beautiful spring day feels the same. The same dark, abysmal emptiness of your soul.

- Snapping at your partner because something they said upset you. But instead of resolving the issue, you retreat within yourself and sit alone in another room. Thinking that maybe if you died, your partner would be better off.

- Thinking that if you died, everyone would be better off. And those thoughts don't feel wrong to you.

- ""I am worthless. I am nothing. I won't ever be anything. I won't ever succeed. Why bother?"""
"Think of something you hate doing. Now imagine doing that thing for the entire rest of your life with no breaks other than sleep if you can even manage that. Now imagine having to try to go through life and do every day things like going to a job you hate every day, getting up super early in the the morning, having no one to talk to, and imagine doing all of that while also dealing with something you hate every second of the day and knowing for a fact that the only way you can make this life of depression (or the thing you hate) and hell go away is to end your life. Now imagine hating yourself so much that you feel like killing yourself would make people around you feel better because you're that much of a burden. And every second you're in constant agony and having to deal with this hell of sadness and thing you hate every second making life impossible even without all the excess stress going on. Now imagine staying in bed for days on end only leaving a few times a week for food and bathroom because you're already dealing with so much that any excess stressers could push you over the edge. That's the best I can describe my life (I mean depression)

Tldr: it feels bad. Very bad. "
"On a good day everything is muted.  Colors are dull. Food doesn't really have a taste.  The only reason you do anything at all is because you have to.  I get out of bed because I have to work.  I eat because I know I'm supposed to.  I talk to people only because I have to.  There is no joy in anything.  Even an orgasm is dull.  

Then there are bad days.  There are two types of bad days for me.  One is serious depression the other is mania.  The depression days are like a lot of folks here, sad, empty, worthless thoughts.  Thinking about everything you've ever done, everything you wanted to do, and realizing that it just doesn't work.  No dreams are realized, no love is had.  That's when I think it'd be easier to just had never existed.  Or... A more frequent thought is that it would be nice to be back in the Navy or some other regimented place.  Where I didn't have to plan out the day, I could just be told what to do and then go do that thing until it was done.  I could eat at the prescribed time.  Eat the food that was served instead of trying to figure out what I might want to eat.  Sleep at the prescribed time.  Get up at the prescribed time.  Just let someone else drive for a while.

The other bad days are manic.  Thinking about every permutation of every possibility of every conversation that had either happened or likely will happen.  Obsessing over things.  Having an odd desire to do things that are risky.  The only porn that works is some kind of fantasy about something that is wrong or taboo.  If you're not careful that can turn into leaving the computer to do things that you normally wouldn't.  Even then, sex doesn't work.  If you can orgasm it doesn't scratch the itch.  You NEED that taboo thing and then after you get it you have a brain orgasm that's not necessarily correlated with a a regular orgasm.  That's probably hard to imagine, but if you've been there, then you know.  There's a constant tightness in the middle of your abdomen.  You can't stop fidgeting, tapping your toe, or your knee.  And the hair trigger on your anger is the absolute worst.  Everything is a threat to you and your life.  My wife once bought the wrong brand of hot dogs... She obviously hated me and wanted to harm me.  But that's not the worst part, the worst part is when you figure out that this isn't normal and you lose trust in your brain.  You can't trust your own mind!  

I started out with just the mania and then got prescribed SSRIs.  That's when the depression came on.  I spent two years with no emotions and you need emotions to make memories.  I don't remember much from those two years.  I finally decided that was fucked and went cold turkey.  Then one day the mania came back in full force, luckily a friend had a MMJ card.  I got some good pot with plenty CBDs and almost instantly got rid of the mania.  I still use the MMJ but it only helps with the mania, I still struggle with the depression.  Anti-psychotics worked for my dad, maybe I'll give them a try next.  If I can find a doctor that I might like.  I don't trust most of them."
"Late to this but: 
For me it starts with guilt. When I get bad I constantly feel guilty for something, real or imagined, so much so that the pang of guilt feeling you get in your gut feels constant and to me feels like what an apple looks like when it goes rotten, all cobwebby and shrunk in on itself. I don't know why I have that visual but that's how it feels to me that that is literally inside me on a bad day. 

Other comments have said how leaving bed and making food seems so difficult and sometimes impossible, but I just want to add that when that happens I'm screaming at myself, most of the time in my head, but sometimes out loud, to do something

And then at the end of the day it's a shitty contradictory thing of I really want to sleep to have a break from these feelings and screaming at myself, and maybe be better tomorrow, but I also really don't want to sleep because then I have to wake up and have to face it all again. Sleep is a release but when you wake up the world is still there, and it's a horrible horrible thing to think but there it is "

"I've had diagnosed clinical depression for a very long time but find I have a more low-key sort of depression than what some people seem to experience.

I've found that when untreated I feel just completely disinterested in everything. My work, my hobbies, my social interactions all become uninteresting and I just simply don't care about anything.

And unfortunately it's not the dismissive, do-anything ""American Beauty"" sort of not caring, but rather everything seems pointless.

I go to work because I need to pay bills, but I don't provide input or feedback, I don't stand up for myself when my boss (of my day job) does his typical steamrolling of everyone. Because why bother?

Models will be available and ready to shoot but I won't have any inspiration or drive to create anything. Because why bother?

Even things like crossing the street or the like become a matter of ""why look both ways? what does it matter?""

To me when I'm untreated I don't care at all about anything. Whether I live or die, whether I succeed or fail, whether people enjoy their time with me or not."

"I have anxiety for sure-diagnosed and all, but throughout the years I've gained depression from it. I just feel stuck-stuck in the same old boring, mundane routine and nothing is stimulating my mind enough to make me feel happy and/or smile.

Even if it hurts, it's a different note. "

"The best anology I ever saw was on Reddit somewhere, but I can't recall where so I'll just recreate it the best I can. 

Imagine you're very slowly losing your sense of taste. You don't notice at first, more of a, huh nothing I ate today was very good, or, this restaurant used to taste a lot better, and so on and so forth. Eventually, you realize that no matter what you eat, it tastes like mashed potatoes (and not good buttery mashed potatoes, just nothingness microwaved mashed potatoes). So slowly, you start to give up hope. You still eat, because you have to, but you get no joy from it, because everything tastes like mashed potatoes. So you slowly stop putting effort into making good tasting food, and you stop eating foods you used to like because it doesn't matter. After a while people start to notice something's wrong, or maybe you reach out for help, and you get things like 'Have you tried eating foods you used to like?' and 'Maybe if you just put more effort into your food you wouldn't feel like this' or 'My uncle's cousin's neighbor had this problem, here's this obscure homeopathy shit that'll totally fix it!' and 'Maybe try different foods!' and this advice really isn't helpful, because *everything tastes like mashed potatoes*. 

That's what it feels like to be chronically depressed, but your sense of taste is your ability to feel happiness, and your willingness to eat tasty foods and put effort into your food is your motivation to do things you used to enjoy (your favorite sport, hobby, sometimes even watching your favorite tv show takes to much effort), and your willingness to put effort into your food is how much motivation you have for life. You keep going because there's no other choice, but it just feels like shit. And sometimes it gets to the point where you can't keep going. 

This is how I've felt since I was about 10 or 11 (I'm 15 now for context) however, I've recently learned something new. How it feels to get out of depression. Long story short March 11th 2016 I tried to kill myself, and ended up in the hospital. I'd been in therapy and on meds for a while but they'd never really helped, so I'd just given up. But while I was in the hospital (about 2 weeks) they were constantly checking my vitals and talking to me and stuff, so they were able to up my meds more than 100% without worry of side effects. and that's when I noticed things started to change. I felt more comfortable participating in therapy groups, I found myself smiling and laughing more often. In a similar vein to how I said it feels to become depressed, I assumed it was a fluke, like, oh today was weirdly good, but I'm sure I'll feel like shit tomorrow, because that was my normal. And maybe I did feel like shit the next day, but the day after I felt good again. It wasn't just the meds, the therapy was good too, I learned alot of coping mechanisms in there, but it was my medication and therapy working together that really changed my life. Two weeks later, I went back to school. At first I was just anxious as hell to be back, but a few weeks later I noticed that it wasn't quite as hard to make myself do schoolwork, whereas a few months ago, it was near impossible to even get out of bed. I managed to pass all my classes that year, much to my own surprise. But the real change came this school year. (I don't particularly like summer for mostly unrelated reasons, but over the summer I began to rediscover passions I had as a child, such as going outside and nature and reading and art). Anyways, this year has been different than any year I can remember since elementry school. I enjoy being at school, I don't have a problem getting my homework done, sure I have some missing assignments, but then I finish them. I ask for help when I need it. I started my first college class this semester, because I was *ahead*. I kept waiting for everything to fall apart again, but it didn't. I'm currently in my 3rd week of my college class, and I'm still doing well in both that and my highschool classes. I still have some bad days, but they aren't every day. Maybe like 3/7 days a week are bad days, and even then, they aren't as bad as they used to be. Some things I can't change yet, I can't get out from under my emotionally abusive mother's reach, but I can deal with her without wanting to die. I can't get out of highschool yet, but I can succeed in it. It's astonishing really. It was hard, I essentially rediscovered my own personality over summer break, because I've been depressed for as long as I can remember (and yes I do mean I can't remember much from the ages of 8 and below lmao), but i've done it, I've formed close relationships and I've learned how to feel the empathy I once had so much of. I still see my therapist once every other week (I wish it was still once a week but my mom doesn't want to pay for it but that's another rant, this comment is long enough) and I see my Psychiatrist once every few months to make sure my meds are going well (also just cuz I like her, she shows me pics of her cats) and it's still hard sometimes, but I actually have hope for the future. Basically what I'm trying to do is talk to all the people that (like me) came to this thread because they knew the answer. I know you always hear this and roll your eyes (trust me I did too) but it can get better. I can't garuntee that it *will*, because to be honest you have to be willing to try and to cooperate (like with therapy and stuff, which I know is hard as hell (I'm stubborn it pisses my therapist off sometimes)) but it can happen. I didn't believe it for the longest time, but it did. It just occured to me that the majority of my comment isn't actually answering the question, but I think it's relevent enough, not to mention important. If you read this far, thank you for doing so, [Here](https://imgur.com/I09iEnv) is a picture of my dog as a show of gratitude lol. 

TL;DR Depression is like losing your sense of taste, and ik you've heard it a million times before, but it can get better. "
"Depression is very different for everyone. It can be one symptom, or a dozen.

Everything you used to love and enjoy slowly fades from wonderful to agonizing, as if your fav show dropped off every good writer and only hired people who agreed to twist every character into an asshole or bore.

What used to make you laugh now makes you shrug, and then makes you furious.

What used to get you out of bed everyday now makes you want to stay in bed forever.

Guilty and embarrassing memories from your earliest years will play incessantly any time you want to motivate yourself to try to pull yourself out of the hole.

Your mind refuses to be silent when you need to sleep, reminding you of anything and everything that bubbles up- and it will bubble like freshly opened seltzer.

But when you need inspiration, that seltzer has gone flat. When you need to concentrate, it comes up empty.

Now and then, when you get just a tiny bit frustrated, you will cry. Over things you don't need to cry about. And that will be a memory dredged up for weeks of shame.

When you desperately need to cry, you can't bring up even a mist in one eye. That too, you will remember.

You'll take drastic measures to feel anything at all: anger, sadness, happiness, pain... Pain is the only consistent companion, and seeking it out will leave scars, whether you can see them or not.

And should you mention being depressed, every goddamn person wants to know how you're fixing it- as if you needed to dig a well, but all you have is a spoon, and the only question anyone asks is, ""When are you going to get a shovel?"" IF I HAD A SHOVEL, I WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE USING IT, AND IF WE COULD FIX OUR DEPRESSION, HAVING DEPRESSION WOULD BE A SPORT FOR THE WEALTHY.

And you have to always be ready, because depression rarely leaves your life- it only steps out of the room."
"Some days, it just feels like normal. You go through the routine, you’re able to laugh at something you find funny, you’re able to exist as other people exist.

Then it hits. Mostly apathy. Mostly not seeing the point in getting out of bed. It doesn’t really seem like it’s possible to make it through the day. Everything is just bleak."
Exhausting.  
"It feels like your life is over before it begun and you have no one to blame but yourself. And it haunts you. And then you have a good day, and something triggers it, and then it crushes down on you."
"No motivation, trouble sleeping, thoughts of not being good enough or never achieving anything, no matter where you go or what you do there’s always that voice in the back of your head bringing you down, but you still have to act happy to assure other people everything is okay. Please if anyone is struggling with depression or suicidal thoughts and is reading this, reach out and get help, things do get better I promise you that."
"Feeling like everyone you know and have just met hate you even though you rationally can kind of see that you're fairly normal and okay. Having a headache almost everyday from constant anxiety and not sleeping well. Not being able to get out of bed because you're just so heavy and tired. Feeling like your heart is going to explode from panic when you sit in a room with lots of people, like going to class - even though you know there's no danger and everything is fine. Immediately sink into intense self hate whenever something goes wrong, like if someone honked at you on the road. Thinking about killing yourself every day multiple times a day. Crying for hours occasionally out of nowhere because your chest just hurts and it feels like you're full of just weight and rocks and a black hole. Almost bursting into tears regularly while eating lunch.

The worst part is probably the fact that you still appear to be functioning so well that nobody knows you're fantasizing about killing yourself all the time. Your friends love you, your family loves you, but you hide it so well they don't know. You go to work, go to class, have an adult life but you go home from a good day and want to kill yourself. And you don't know why. You can't find a reason. And that makes you think you're just so selfish how can you be so selfish to want death when you have it so good. Then you cry some more about that and hate yourself more. It's exhausting."
"My depression is secondary to anxiety. But this is how it is for me. I worry about everything. I go over anything and everything, i find something that could go wrong. Then i obsess about that. That makes me stressed and short tempered. Then i feel like everything is just going wrong.

In the end it really feels like my life is just an endless struggle. It gets to the point where i just dont have any fight left. When im medicated i dont obsess as much and it breaks the cycle.

I logically understand my life is pretty great. I know how stupid it is to worry like that but that doesn't stop me."
"Firstly, depression is supposedly a mental mechanism to cope with overbearing negative emotions. It drops down emotional sensitivity a LOT. Good and bad. You can't really be truly upset or sad, but you can't be happy either.

Let's use some imagery in a metaphor-story.  

You're at your house. Your pain in the ass family is having a reunion. There's the nut job cousin, your mom's on her short temper after driving her home from the airport. Everyone's a tiny bit happy to see each other, but your older brother's being an asshole as usual to you, denouncing you and making insensitive but not really mean jokes, and the family's laughing along with them. 

It's too much and you just nope the fuck out of there, and lock yourself in a closet, on the verge of tears (let's just pretend a closet locks with a key, with a keyhole on the inside). It's dark and the sound of the chaos outside is muffled, but you can hear them talking still, sometimes laughing. You can't make out the words they're saying, it might be jokes about you, it might be the weather, or aunt Suzy being clumsy as she usually is, nearly knocking something over for the third time. You can see a small band of light projecting underneath the door against the wood floor and hitting the heap of garments you rest on, but it doesn't shine on you and you can't really reach it. 

Then you realize you can't feel the key in your pocket. Dumbass! how could you lose the fucking key? It's somewhere in there, maybe in the mountainlike mound of cloth you're sort of sitting/leaning on. It probably fell out of your pocket when you shifted five minutes ago. 

There's no lightbulb anywhere in there. You can't see the clothes or the little key somewhere in them. There's some hangars dangling over your head, you think. Certainly not enough for all of the clothes though. You can't put them anywhere else, can't look through them as you dig. You can only hope to dig with your hands for a literal needle in a haystack to get back out. Your hands worm around for what feels like an hour and you give up on finding the key. Why the hell would you want to be out there with them? It's their fault you're in there. You locked yourself in there because of how upset they made you. Maybe you could knock against the door and one of them will hear it? Sure, then you'd be a laughing stock. Better just stay in here. 

They all go out to eat dinner, (not missing you clearly). The house is dead silent. Your ass is still stuck in there. Hey though, the clothes are sort of comfy to lean on, and you got out of putting up with your family for a few hours, right? Decent enough? Why not just stay in there?

Your stomach growls. Well, shit. Guess it's fine though. You're not that hungry. You keep digging. You lie down on the clothes while nonchalantly shuffling the same few things back and forth. You stop for what feels like a minute. 

Your breathing is slower. You're actually pretty hungry now. It's probably like 3am. Freeze. 

How do you feel? You're angry at your family and at yourself for getting into this situation. Them for inciting it and you for doing it. You're upset because now you're just hungry and want food, maybe some water and to use the restroom. It isn't super urgent but it's decently uncomfortable as is. You hate yourself for locking yourself in there, and don't think anyone else really cares, since they were mean to you, and no one really noticed. They don't care about you, and that just makes you feel even worse about yourself. Still though, these feelings are all blunted. You're drowsy and sort of really hungry. It's boring in the closet. 

It's isolating and really numbing, you can still feel a bit good and bad, but mostly you feel self pity, self loathing, and not much else. You can't really communicate with anyone else, and maybe you want to, maybe not. You don't know how to get out and don't really think anyone else can help. 

That's about as close as I can get with it. I have anxiety issues, and the two are just really bad together. I feel like I've been coming out of depression, I've been happier recently than I have been for quite some time, but my mood has been getting a lot less stable too, and about once every 2-6 weeks since like October (ish?) I will spend a single day (or most of one) a *complete* wreck. Like Dec 29th I think, I just sulked around for a full day (after being sort of down the day before). I consumed a single slice of pizza and a fair bit of water over actually 38 hours or so. It felt like every part of my body (my head, arms, midsection, legs) each had a 20 pound (9kg for sane people) weight tied to it. I spent a sunday night/monday morning in november (think the weekend after thanksgiving) freaking out about everything. I was up till at least 2am, to get up between 6:30 and 7:00 for school. So... like 2 hours at least of being absolutely all over the place, freaking out. Yeah. It's fun. 

I guess that's all I have to say. For the record the story is entirely fiction. I have no brother or aunt suzy, and it has nothing to do with ""being in the closet."" A closet was just a tight dark place for me to use as a location. "
"It feels like nothing. Nothing you do feels like anything so you don't want to do a thing. Movie you loved? Boring. Activities you looked forward to? Boring. Going on dates? Boring. Calling your family? Boring. Attending class? Boring. Seeing other perfectly happy people talking with each other and knowing you can't be that happy because something inside of you decided so? *Boring.* Not painful. Boring. You stop really feeling the pain along with everything else. Everything becomes a monotonous drudge no matter what you're doing.

Coupling this with responsibilities and expectations leads to a self defeating cycle of 'why am I like this' where you do the wrong thing every time and then remember that moment in perfect clairity for *years.* It extends from social situations to studying. Your mind only really focuses on all the stuff you've done wrong, in fact it brings it up to you all the fucking time at random intervals, and that keeps you from moving forward.

So being depressed is a mental weight of literal emptiness."
"Ever had a roach on you, feel the disgust for it being there, but unable to work up the energy or true caring to brush it away?  I have.

Imagine that apathy to everything for 6 years.  I'm mostly better from that void, but it is just that.  A void.  I'm only 32, I can't remember most of my childhood, and I can't remember most of my twenties.  From what I've read, most people can't remember much of their depression.

Although I could easily tell you what I was doing.  If it was a work day I would sleep for about 12 hours or so, eat incredibly unhealthy shit that takes no effort to make or order delivery.  I would spend the rest of the time reading until it was time for work.

If it wasn't a work day I would sleep about 12 hours, eat unhealthy shit, and read until I could fall back to sleep.  Perhaps some video games.

Both of those days, I would think ""I want to die.""  Usually every 5 minutes at the far ends, more frequently if I could get myself to read/game."

"Lol it fuckin sucks. Most of these people got it right. You’re tired. You think too much. You can’t sleep. Everything feels like a chore. You don’t enjoy things anymore. You forget how to talk to old friends. But you don’t really try so you kind of separate. Always irritated. Don’t want to talk. 



I’ve been really good at hiding it. My friend/s make me happy but there’s some times I really want to reach out and even get to the point of “I’m gonna see them soon I’m strong enough to reach out and talk about it now” because let’s be real we never talk about our depression. We just try to brace the waves ourselves regardless if we know how to swim or not. So anyway you get to a point where you’re ready and then something major happens and I have to put myself on hold. I have to be there for someone else. I have to be a different me. I have to wait because it’s someone’s birthday. And I deal with it on my own and stay numb and sometimes am able to be okay for a bit until I have a break down because my mom was too tired to say thank you for me making dinner for the first time in 2 weeks. Or because my boyfriend is too busy practicing guitar and I just want him to talk to me. Or because I’m thinking about all the things I need to do or should have done. But normally I just stay numb. I don’t enjoy things that much even things I like to do because half way to a place I realize it’ll be over soon and I’ll feel lonely and dead inside so I might as well not fake enthusiasm and just ruin it for myself. 



My friends think I’m ditzy and the typical “goofy dumb blonde” I must seem like bubbles from power puff girls to them. But I’m full of anger and sadness when I’m alone. It’s weird when I’m around people who a similar to me I’m more optimistic. Like when I was younger. There are two versions of me and I like the happy one best but she’s hard to bring out unless I’m with the right people. She’s shy and gets exhausted from being so outgoing. And then there’s me when no ones looking.

You know you could talk to your friends, you know you could go visit them but it's a long, dark journey that could hurt you to get back to Earth."
It feels like nothing. Emptiness. A void. I can’t feel. It sucks. 
"I tell this to everyone,  but the song title for Pink Floyd’s “Comfortably Numb”. 
Just don’t bother me, leave me alone. I don’t care. I’m not sad or angry or upset. No I don’t wanna hang out. Just leave me be. "

"Depression is different for everyone’s sometimes. For me, it’s like I’m drowning, trying to reach the surface but an anchor is tied around my ankle, pulling me further down into the water. Some days, I’m fine, but most days I’m fighting the urge to just go back to sleep. I never get anything done because I see no point. I never want to do anything. I just want to curl up in a ball and sleep forever. It’s like slepe is my only escape. But it doesn’t last long."
"First of all for people with depression talk to loved ones about it and dobt be ashamed  its a hard step to take but its a life or death situation...

Everybody has different levels of depression but the symptoms are generally the same, you feel pissed off alot over tiny things, like dropping your pen or the battery dying on your drill will make you livid, you are constantly tired and want to sleep 24/7,no matter how much sleep you get it feels like you have been up all night, you wake up emotionally drained, your grasp on reality starts to change the worse it gets, i almost blew my brains out while i was out hunting one time because i thought nobody loved me, i was a neusance ( not sure how to spell it my bad if its wrong) you doubt yourself constantly, everything that happens you think its your fault, i started wondering why my friends i consider brothers were friends with me, i was a mess, my life was in the shitter and i was on rock bottom, there were days i was hoping to get a spedding ticket just so that i would finally have a good enough reason to blow my head off, isnt that some shit, then it evolved into driving down the highway and every time i passed a semi on the road my brain would think you should drive into it and end it all, you dont have control of your thoughts and emotions, its much easier to be dead or asleep all the time so you dont have to deal with that 20,000 lb monster thats slowly eating away at your soul and the person you used to be, you just have to find something that pushes you to keep living, for me it was family, deep down i knew these terrible thoughts werent truly mine and they werent even close to the truth, get help talk with loved ones and dont be ashamed, also sorry for my 4 page essay its just the tiniest portion of what its like"
"I feel like crap everyday.. I don't have any motivation to do anything and I am just exhausted.. I feel that I am waisiting my time , but I can't do anything about it, like life is slipping away. I am isolating myself from close friends and family and I don't want to hang out with anyone anymore.. Its so hard especially now when I am in school , I have to socialize with people and deal with dumb c*nts. I feel hopeless and lifeless and I am drowning in my own thoughts, not being able to share with anyone, cuz I am too scared what they'll think of me.. Its awfull and I hope that if you, who are reading this , if you are going through the same thing, please reach out for help and dont be like me.."
"Each time I blink, it seems a like little more color fades from the world.  I get up in stages, each taking more effort than I have to give. I lose time, someone will tap me and tell me I've been looking at the floor for an hour. I mumble an apology, and try to remember where I was going. I forget things. I mean to call friends and family, but it takes me an hour just to get off the couch. I look out the window and I'm surprised it's night, I thought it was noon. I think the food in the fridge is gone bad, maybe I'll go to the store tomorrow. "
"I got this off of the internet but it relates to me way too much.
Depression is like being in a 40 metre deep pit with a broken leg in the middle of a vast, empty desert. Nobody ever comes by and if they do, they don't bother to waste their time on a figurative corpse. You could always try to get out of the pit by climbing 40 metres. But what if you climb 39 and then slip thanks to your broken leg? All you need to get out is someone or something which will help you with all its got. But nobody bothers."
it's pretty depressing tbh
"It feels like you know for a fact the world would be a better place without you, but your to cowardly and selfish to end yourself "
"emotional equivalent of when your mum drags you out to buy sheets or towels or underwear at the mall when you're like 8 and she refuses to look at anything you enjoy PLUS when you know you failed an important test and you're just waiting to have physical graded confirmation of how much of a lazy piece of shit you are PLUS when you're in a big city crowded with people and you just get the horrible feeling that you could drop dead and no one would look twice

its like your brain turns into this awful ice desert, not even a regular desert because those are still teeming with life if you know where to look- just this horrible arid freezing tundra where nothing ever grows and its just white in every direction, the ground is white and the sky is white and there are no other people for thousands of miles."
"I was diagnosed with depression after about a year of misery. For me it wasn't apathy so much as stasis. My mind wouldn't show emotion, wouldn't change the default setting of detachment. Maybe that's apathy, but it's hard to explain how it wasn't that I didn't care, I just only moved emotionally in small increments. 

The bigger issue was the physical pain. For almost a year I felt like I had the flu. I ached all over. It was a nightmare. 

My GP, after trying all non-medication options to treat depression failed, she put me on the lowest dose of Zoloft. 

I remember the exact time my brain reset. It was about two weeks into taking it, my wife decided she wanted to get out of the house (it was a nice early spring day) and as she was driving around there was one second I felt like crap, and the next, it was like a physical shift in my head and I feel normal again. 

It was the strangest feeling in my head. I stayed on Zoloft for another two years, came off it and have been fine ever since. "
"I get only bouts of it (so it's not necessarily clinical depression), but the sensation of total apathy is no less tangible. You lose interest in virtually everything, even things outside your hobbies such as work or school. You long to feel something, *anything*, but nine times out of ten, you can't."
"Probably going to get downvoted into oblivion and called ignorant for having this opinion but here goes anyway:

I don't believe in the majority of people who claim to be the victim of depression or ""social anxiety"".
These words get thrown around way too much even though they were pretty much unheard of in everyday life 20 years ago.

I'm not here to tell anyone how they should feel but as someone born in 1993 I absolutely am disgusted by my peers and their weak minds. It bothers me to see someone that has lost everything try so hard to achieve things in life and then there are these kids who had a perfectly fine childhood whining about how hard life is and how depressed they are. No, you're not. You have no valid reason to be depressed. Do you need a reason to be depressed? Bunch of wannabe depressed people will say no but fuck yeah you do. You do need a reason to be depressed and a good one at that.

You know what... I can't even be bothered with explaining this anymore. I've grown up in a fucked up situation and yes I've felt horrible at times but NEVER would I sit back and call it depression. Sure there were times my blanket felt like a 1000kg and I didn't want to get out of bed; but it was at that moment that I went the extra mile and just powered through the day. Stop being so weak and downright lazy.

Of course I respect everyone who has a REAL reason to be depressed and is ACTIVELY FIGHTING to overcome their depression instead of being a whiny wannabe that just says ""oh my god please don't judge me but just listen to me and invite me to things"". Well maybe if you weren't such a pathetic loser you wouldn't get judged and invited to parties by default.

It's not cool to have a depression and you should all stop claiming you have one if you haven't seen some real fucked up shit. People with a depression will also not tell you they have one; they fight it on their own. And social anxiety? Jesus... get over yourself. Just because you're an introvert or nerd doesn't mean you have social anxiety. Show up for life. Ever asked a ""depressed"" person WHY they are depressed? They'll tell you ""I don't know... I just am... my fish died"" always these nonsense answers. Someone who actually has a reason to be depressed will tell you some real shit.

Sorry for the anger in this post but this has obviously been some built up frustration. I just despise these attention seeking losers that take away the attention from the REAL depressed people that need our love.

edit: Thanks for gilding the comment."
"Depression is an unaccepted death and a refusal of rebirth. It's hanging inbetween the two like you're struggling against what you know should die and the fear of taking a step into a new world or a new you. You become neurotic in the end and wallow and ruminate about whatever it is that you've done. Depression is a lack of courage, it's a fear which sedates your actions and through procrastination and neglect you finally end stuck inside a hole which you cannot climb out of, you're missing the train that keeps going past the station and by the train I mean every new day. Allow yourselves to die, allow yourselves to be reborn and practice compassion towards yourselves. Allow yourselves to gently lift up your will and bring your legs out of the bed, allow yourselves to take time by sitting at your desk and asking yourselves ''What do I really want ?'' Death should be quick, mourn what must be mourned and move on. Illustrate your lives and mythologize your actions as though you were the hero from some long forgotten story. Though I know we don't face literal monsters it is best to act as though you are facing monsters. Poets and artists know that through imagination there is a key that holds vitality, it is extremely important (especially in this day and age where technology has rendered us stale) that we may be able to live as though we are going through hell itself. It is extremely important that a sense of madness remains. Society holds you by the nose when it tells you that you are only a bunch of chemicals. It's time to break out of that, to grow up and finally pick up your swords and begin to slay what must be slayed. It's time to rise up. I suggest the Bhagavad Gita, chapter 2."
"It's different for everyone, so I'll write my own little paragraph, telling a story like most people seem to be doing. I'll be going through a typical day

You wake up. What day is it? Thursday. Shit. There's school today. You have to get out of bed. I mean, you *could* skip your classes today, but then you'd just feel worse about being lazy. So you, throw off the blanket and shut off your alarm. Time to have a shower.

""Why does everyone else get to be happy? This is bullshit. I want to be happy. Those fuckers don't know how good they have it. If I were them, I wouldn't be complaining all the time like them. They don't know what REAL suffering is"" This clouds your thoughts in between visions of some of the more traumatic things you've seen.  Once you step out of the shower, no matter how you look, no matter what shape your in, all you see can think is ""What a disgusting eye soar you are. You're fucking fat. Don't eat today. No matter what, don't eat today""

It's time to leave the house. You decide you look good enough, you may even like your outfit. You play a song you've heard a hundred times before. It's white noise, time to think about your life. So now your sufficiently depressed for the bus ride. If you don't have a book or homework, you're fucked. If you DO have one of those things, you're saved! You have something to focus on other than your own misery.

Once you make it to school, you get a bit of distraction from how you feel. Class will drag on, even if it's an interesting subject. Something has to be wrong... there always has to be something wrong. If there isn't something actually wrong, you'll make it up. Breaks in between classes, unless they're spent with friends, where you get to have temporary distraction from your depression, are spent thinking about your situation 

""Why am I like this? What did I do to deserve this? Is there a god? Maybe there is. Maybe I deserve this. I've done some shitty things. I'm kind of a piece of shit""

The trip home is a bit better, since you probably have homework or studying to do. You do that... while some thoughts swirl around your head

""I'm doing this wrong. I'm fucking this up. I'm gonna fail this test. I'm gonna fail this class. I'm gonna get kicked out. I'll end up working at *minimum wage job* forever... Fuck""

You finally make it home. Time to get ready for work. Once you're at work, if you work alone, you get PLENTY of time to think about your life

""I don't deserve this. I'm so unhappy. I want to just end it. I could. I could leave right now and get hit by a truck. No, I can't do that. I have to keep living. I can't do that to my family, or my friends. I just can't.""

You'll eventually make it home. You're tired, but like fuck if you're going to bed. You'll stay up all night, doing whatever you can to try and mitigate the pain. Most of it will be pointless. But you still try. Some of it may make you feel worse. But eventually, you'll be up enough to the point where you feel you can go to bed, without thoughts keeping you from at least a passably restful sleep.

Sorry that this isn't as good as other ones. I tried. "
The worst part is not you. Its the others. There is absolutely zero normies who can help you. Sooner or later they'll start treating you like a lazy piece of shit or lose interest cause you are not fun. Even therapists or other so called profesionnals are freaking useless. A roomba would help you more than what any other human can do. Oh and forget about meds.
[deleted]
I rarely respond to anything but this is exactly how I feel everyday for about a year now
I've never posted on here before but what you said really hit me deep man. It's scary reading that but I'm starting to feel like that's me nowadays. I can't remember then last time I've gone out and made a new friend outside of coworkers...
"Fuck man, I don't know how you make friends... All my hobbies I have are solitary. And the one hobby I wanted to get into, my anxiety went through the roof. I felt like the people just tolerated me to keep their club status at the University. So I stopped going made an excuse to not buying a HEMA sword and I'm in solitude."
Too close
"What’s worse is when those friends decide you aren’t enough anymore. I had a friend recently cut me off because our “friendship” wasn’t enough for them, I participated too little when in reality I cared too much and gave too much. Of course they didn’t see that, and now I’m stuck with being absolutely friendless when I go off to the uni and away from my family and bf. 
I no longer have the energy to go find another friend, this shit always happens I guess. Fuck people man smh "
I found that my socialization has taken a punch after battling my on-and-off again depression. I can make new friends but can't commit to hanging out outside of the initial meeting and the crowd I was friends with has faded out. 
"As a side note to this: sometimes I feel like dating or making new friends, so I put forth the effort. Then I lose the will/energy for it, and messaging back takes so much effort that I just can't.  Feels bad. I'm such an asshole."
"Is that what it is? Because I've been going through the same thing. 


I don't know how to reach out to old friends in fear that they would freak out or wonder what my purpose is. If they do bite, how do I even make small talk? How do you keep being friends?
"
"This is usually my worst battle with depression. Currently working on it with my therapist, but as much as I crave friendship and socialization, I selfishly hate the obligation. Friendship is exhausting to me. Thankfully the two friends that I have have dealt/deal with depression and/or anxiety, so they completely understand when we go weeks without talking and cancel plans repeatedly. But they also both live hours away, so even when I feel energetic enough for socializing, I don't get to."
"I didn't realize how it's affecting my friendships too, I thought my friendships had changed because of leaving the military and moving - but I don't bother to make new friends either, and don't care to."
Well shit. I know how to small talk with people I'll never see again but as soon as there's something at stake in interactions my brain turns to mush and I get afraid of people being able to hear/see my conversation as if it's abnormal
holy fuck.... I... I... 
There we go. Thread is answered.
"Wait so this is literally me, but I wouldn’t consider myself depressed per se.... I can honestly say I have no friends currently and I never get out and I guess have forgotten how to interact which just gives me anxiety. I’m content as is but I know I should reach out and make friends but I don’t even know how anymore. I get social anxiety around people though, especially when there’s groups of friends and I’m just alone "
Oh God this is me... I don't know how to make friends anymore without looking needy or like a weirdo. Fuck man... I feel so fucking alone.  And it's not like I don't have any hobbies or don't go out... It's just that I don't always like to hangout in the same spot with the same people. Shit gets boring real fucking quick.
"Shiiiit, this sounds awfully familiar... "
"This fits me, or I might just be an asshole. "
"True, how I feel except it wasn't slowly."
"I didnt know this was something that happened to a lot of people

I only have one person in my life left right now, its kind of conforting knowing its more common than I thought but also sad because I dont want others to feel this way."
"I saw this and found it helps going to bars.  Even if you don't drink, going there once a week makes you a regular.  Friends with the bartender, other regulars.  Conversations just happen, and conversations start comfort with people which leads to friends.  Some of the loneliest people are actually in heavy populated areas.  So even if your an introvert, there might be a bar near you that might fit your vibe.  Being alone at a restaurant is awkward and also depressing, but being alone at a bar.... you'll find your not alone at being alone.   "
"Wow. this explains me so much. All my friends moved away for college and I'm the only one who stayed home and went to community. I work a lot and on weekends so I miss a lot. ive had a hard time making new friends of my own. so all i do is binge watch tv shows and movies. this weekend all my friends went up to an awesome cabin in upstate New York, I wasn't invited. my best friend couldn't tell me until I confronted her. She even admitted it was a shitty thing to do. I don't know what to do anymore. "
"I need to get out of this thread befor- Too late.

Your summary is one of the best I've seen in this thread. I thought not eating was just something I did..."
"Alternatively its a gaping hole that you try to fill by shoving your face with whatever your hand lays on. It doesn't matter WHAT you eat as long as it can make you feel complete, but nothing ever feels like enough."
"And it doesn't help when you know you've already let people down, and so you avoid doing anything for them to avoid letting them down, but that in itself is disappointing to them and it just gets worse and worse as you fuck up more and more things and feel like it's just better if you don't try even though you know you have to, and every day just turns into ""did you do that thing I asked you to?"" 

""...no...""

""Why not?""

And I know exactly why I didn't but I don't want to tell them because they'll tell someone else and they'll make me get help and I don't want help even though I know I need it and that's part of my problem and it all just leads back into ""god it'd be better for everyone if I was dead"""
"> ""If I get something to eat, then I'd have to get out the food, and cut it, and cook it, and eat it, and wash the dishes. That's a lot of work. I guess I won't eat.""

Oh my fucking god, yes."
"Keeping decent impulse food on hand is key.  

Protein bars, almonds, raisins, lattes or meal replacement shakes, veggie appetizer tray, cheese sticks...

Sometimes you’re just too tired to cook or wash up, especially before having a bite to eat.  "
"This is so accurate. Not much else to say. I regularly can’t be bothered to eat and am still in bed because I can’t be bothered to get up, shower, put clothes on, make breakfast...I’d often rather be hungry than have to go through the effort of feeding myself."
[deleted]
"For those of you who haven't seen it, I highly recommend Andrew Solomon's Ted talk on depression. It's enlightening if you don't have depression but know people who do."
"Adding to that... there is a misconception that feeling depressed is being ""blue"" or sad or mopey. One of my relatives says ""whenever i get depression I just get busy and it fixes everything!"" 

That isn't depression. You're bored. 

My wife suffers from chronic depression and is now in therapy and on medication but the way she describes it... it is a detachment from life. You're not sad, you just don't care. You *can't* care even about things that you desperately want to care about. Husband, kids... job... *meh* it's too much work to care. Get out of bed today and shower... what's the point. You look out the window at a beautiful sunrise and instead of elation you feel... nothing. Just a blank numbness. "
Oh my god you just described me. 
">  ""If I get something to eat, then I'd have to get out the food, and cut it, and cook it, and eat it, and wash the dishes. That's a lot of work. I guess I won't eat.""

I never associated that with depression, you always hear about eating when depressed. 

This is me, I just cba cooking I would rather just go to bed hungry."
"I gained a lot of weight while depressed (40kg or so) because a lot of the food I had was stupidly easy to eat. I don't want to clean anything or cook anything? pie. use the same plate like 6 times in the microwave. oh look a tub of icecream. dont need to clean a tub. Need a drink? I dont want to wash a glass, ill have an energy drink or an iced coffee and toss the can/carton. Simple shit like that isn't available? Guess im not eating for the next 3-5 days. I knew I was fully capable of making a meal, money wasn't normally an issue, but why spend that much time, that much effort, on me? Why bother, it's just me? What's the point? The 20 minutes to make a basic meal is far too much time to spend on me. It always felt as if anything that required any effort that was only for me just wasn't worth it."
You described how I feel about food and eating very well. I have food in my freezer I could eat but it’s too much work. I can eat if it’s put me in front of me but I have too much apathy to do any prep.
"Damn, i did the no-eating, or sometimes i just go outside, but then i'd think about it's a waste to buy food outside when i have food at home, a damn cycle."
It's soooo much easier to do literally nothing than anything. And I don't want my depression to get the mood down from other people so I'll just keep to myself because I deserve this.
"> It becomes easier to seclude yourself from others because you don't want to disappoint them, or because if you hang out with them then you'll fuck things up again, or maybe because it's just easier to do nothing than to do something.

Plus, it's not like they really want to see/talk to you anyways. Why would they? If you call them up then you're just bothering them. They're only initiating contact because they feel bad for you/some other ulterior motive. You don't contribute to their lives at all and aren't worth it so you may as well do them all a favor and not even bother. Plus, if you hang out then that would mean a lot of work and you're exhausted just thinking about it."
"Dear God that hits home, the breaking down of every single thing into the steps it would take to achieve it, and then simply taking the path of least resistance in the end? 

Instead of eating healthily, finding the easiest possible thing to eat.

Instead of working, living at my parents house and getting more depressed as I know they expect more of me and I know I'm a huge disappointment.

Instead of learning, telling yourself that doing the things you enjoy is learning aswell, when it's really just escapism."
"This one hits me spot on. It's like doing work all day with no reward other than getting to wake up tomorrow and do it all again. Fuck, man."
OMG. I could've wrote every word. makes me sad and happy (not alone) knowing this happens to others.
"Yeah, I avoid all of my friends because I don't want them to see my new unimproved 80 lbs heavier in two years self and think, ""well he got fat.""

Sad thing is, I think that about other people all the time. Oof."
"> ""If I get something to eat, then I'd have to get out the food, and cut it, and cook it, and eat it, and wash the dishes. That's a lot of work. I guess I won't eat.""

That's how my depressed mind works about anything *healthy*. But I can totally work up the energy to order pizza, or stop for fast food on my way home, or eat an entire family sized bag of chips because eating distracts me from feeling sad."
"> You look in the kitchen, and think: ""If I get something to eat, then I'd have to get out the food, and cut it, and cook it, and eat it, and wash the dishes. That's a lot of work. I guess I won't eat.""

too real"
"I feel this way too hard. There are too many steps. Getting dressed? Well you have to make sure the clothes are vlesn. They can't be wrinkled or have holes, you need matching socks and where are my shoes and your hair looks like shit and I can't find a bra 

In the end I throw on what I wore yesterday and hope it doesn't reek and my coworkers don't notice. "
This feeling must be amplified when you're arguing with people on online and they start pointing out your spelling errors. 
"This is spot on.  When I went through it, this is pretty much how I felt.  I secluded myself and just existed.  Nothing appealed to me.  If you had asked me at the time: ""If you could do *anything* right now, what would it be?"", I wouldn't have had an answer.  

I wasn't particularly sad or upset about anything specific, it was just that living my life was a chore.  I had no drive or desire to do anything other than exist."
This comment hit me way too close to home. 
"> You think about every little mistake you've ever made, things normal people brush off like nothing, but instead you think ""Fuck, I'm worthless. Why do I even bother when I fuck things up like that. I'm worthless""

"TIL I might need to talk to a professional about depression.

Apathy towards everything is not normal..."
"This is my girlfriend through and through. She's said these exact things to me before.. 

She says she will never feel happiness because it's not possible for her. It's been hard but I sort of understand how she can feel that because I have gone through small parts of life depressed but not to the extent as I've learned others deal with it all their life.. 

From someone else who deals with this.. is there anything I can do besides be there for her?

Recently one of two things have been happening either she's starting to feel better (long shot) or she is learning to not say certain things around me because she doesn't want to make me feel bad for her.. "
"Yup, to the point that I sleep for 12 hours and play games for the other 12"
This is something I definitely feel. No I don't know if I'm depressed or just really lazy.
This is my life
"Yeah, I lost 10kg in two months because of the can't-be-arsed-to-eat thing. It was easier to light another cigarette, so I did"
This is too real. Bleh
 This is far too accurate. 
"Yep. I remember all of the bad and dumb things I've done in my life and beat myself up over them. Everything feels like a chore, even things I really love to do. I feel like no one understands. Everything feels raw and empty. I'm willing to do almost anything to avoid feeling this kind of empty again. "
"I ate too much simply to be able to feel something. Anything, really... Then I hated myself for wasting resources on a worthless life that's already fulfilled its biological purpose by reproducing, and is now simply a drain on the ""system"".

Damn, depression is awful."
The worst part is how hard it is to break this shit. Like I've been called lazy so much in my life that I believe I am. I just can't seem to force myself to do anything. You know it's bad when emptying the fucking dishwasher makes you feel accomplished.
"I love Andrew Solomon. I highly recommend his TED talk on Depression, and I have his book on my Kindle. He's able to put into words what's so difficult to, and you can tell that he's been to that point of exhaustion. "

Ugh the meal thing. I made a casserole over the weekend intending to eat it all week and I haven't even reheated one piece because it's too hard.
"100% what I experienced for a couple years, recently started medication and finally getting to a point where I feel interest in things. Raising the dosage a bit so hopefully will keep improving."
I didn't come out tonight to get personally attacked like this.
"Andrew Solomon’s ted talk -

[Depression, the secret we share ](https://youtu.be/-eBUcBfkVCo) 

“You don’t think in depression that you’ve put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood. You think that the veil has been taken away, the veil of happiness, and that now you’re seeing truly.”"
Spot on.
That's a really good summary. I couldn't describe it better myself!
That TED Talk hit way too close to home. I cried like a baby.
"Yup. Something I try to keep ever present is routine and preparation. This helps so much when you're going through a depressive spell (also when you're not). If your house is clean, groceries are bought, laundry is done, etc. that removes a lot of the stress from when you're depressed. Because when you're feeling depressed, every little task seems overwhelming. But if you don't have so many little tasks, it helps. "

"There's no way this doesn't get buried and forgotten in the comments, but damn. I consider myself a generally decently happy person but these are all a lot of things I do kind of regularly actually and think nothing of. That's a little bit of a scary thought..."

"Andrew Solomon's TedTalk really helped me through my depression and better yet, when friends or family want to educate themselves about it because they or someone they know has depression--I always start by linking them the video. It's 30 mins but educates so well. "
Ok I think I might have depression....the feeling worthless part becAuse of mistakes hit hard
Fuck.  Pretty sure I've suffered from depression for years.
"While I'm sure many other comments colorfully describe their experience with depression I think your summary is the most on point and understandable way to describe the practical experience and consequences of depression to someone who has never experienced it themselves. 

""I just don't feel like doing it, it being the dishes, showering, eating, texting my friend back, getting out of bed, watching TV. It all takes too much energy and it's just not worth the effort."""
"This is me. And the biggest thing that has helped me in treating it is actually recognizing that it is a part of who I am that I’ll always have to work on, recognize, manage, whatever. Doesn’t go away and it is not just a fucking phase."
"I have the first thing, but not the second. My lack of self-loathing and incrimination makes me think I *don't* have depression, but I have all the other stuff. 

I don't seek help because I tell myself it's not that bad, but most of the time I just want to cry when I have to get up in the morning."
Yes. 
"I have described depression as ""feeling like a sack of bricks""."
"I'm not depressed, but that pretty much sums me up"
I loved that talk. However it's all too relatable right now. 
"This is more my experience than the top comment.  In fact, that's how I know when I'm having a depressive episode, when *everything* just seems like more effort than it's worth.  "
Didn’t really know that this was depression. Realizing that I have depression is depressing
This except I'm atypical so instead of just not eating ill  order in 2 dinners and eat them both.
"I actually do get this ""ugh, don't wanna prepare food, I won't eat"" thing, but it only lasts about 15 minutes, then I'm like ""OKAY, I'M TOO HUNGRY, NOT HAPPENIN"""
"I'm depressive, but what you're describing sounds more like laziness...."
"I can already see the comments that criticize me for saying this, but isn’t that just called laziness? I don’t mean to be insensitive, but people with depression lose all levels of empathy and sympathy and most of the time they think the world revolves around them, which results in their depression. "
"same, in a way. I'm not suicidal, and I'm sometimes happy, but most of the time I just kinda wish I could stop existing for a bit and take a breather"
[deleted]
"Not wanting to do anything hit me the worst.  All the games I used to play everything I used to love doing all have no point.  As soon as my friends aren't around me I have no real desire to see them no matter how close we are.  If they move to another city I never see or talk to them again.  I wish every day that I had the courage to call them or go see them but no matter how much I try my body just lays there in bed.  I feel my future slipping away and know that every day I keep doing nothing it gets worse but all those thoughts do is drive me further under the covers.

At least that's how it was about a year ago.  Doing better now.  Hope it stays that way."
Correct. You literally just want to sleep and never wake up again. 
">  I don't necessarily want to die

...but if I would need to take meds to avoid dying in the next 20 years I probably wouldn't take them.

That's how i felt."
"I couldn't have said it better myself.

I don't want to live, but I think that actually committing suicide is a chore. I would probably just cause a lot of problems for people around me with it, and having buried my father recently I know its a big cost for the family too, so I might as well just exist.

Its a ""I don't want to live, but I wouldn't really mind if I got hit by a car tommorrow"""
"I relate wayyyyy too much to this. I came clean to my mother about my mental illnesses, depression and anxiety/social anxiety, last week and one of the questions she asked me was ""Are you suicidal?""

I had trouble trying to figure out what to tell her and she realised I was hesitating to answer but in the end I said ""I'm not suicidal per se, not actively, but if an asteroid would annhiliate the earth tomorrow I'd be relieved."""
For me it's more like i want to disappear from everyone i know.
"I really don'tt want to be anything and obliterate into non-existance,"
Thank you... thought I was the only person who hit that realisation for a while.
This is the simplest answer. It's almost exactly how I've felt since I was about 12. 
This is exactly how I feel right now. I just want to sleep to stop being aware.
"This.  We share this feeling.  I pray to God, if there is one, every night asking to die and just never exist"
Oof this is me in a nutshell. 
"yup.

the thought of just not waking up was appealing. "
"This was exactly what led to me seeking out treatment and being diagnosed. I would frequently tell my best friend that I was going through my 'man period' where I literally didn't wanna do anything. Video games, sex, reading, etc. Literally was so apathetic about life that I wish I could just skip that week. He told me that it wasn't normal to feel that way and I should see a doctor."
I don't want to die I just don't care about being alive and nothing could feel worse than that. 
"Yep, pretty much.
I never did shit in MS and HS and dropped out at 17.    
Depression started at 13.    
Lucky for me, anxiety,paranoia and likely BPD came later to make depression feel like a good day.
"
"For me, it's nothing suicidal. Just thoughts of what lies ahead. If anything. Thinking wether it's worth taking the time to find out or just let it eat you away day by day. My curiosity might get the best of me one of these days. "
I read this somewhere and it’s really stuck with me: I don’t want to die. I just don’t know how to live.
"I thought I was alone in regards to this feeling. I never knew other people felt the same way as me. I’ve only ever told my husband that sometimes I wish I didn’t exist, and I feel like I can’t tell anyone else because they would probably think I’m insane and/or wouldn’t really care. "
"Damn, that hit close to home :("
"For me it's the opposite. Days, weeks go by without realizing that 2 weeks has passed and I'm still in that space of time."
"Days go too slow, but years go too fast."
The only thing you really want to do is sleep. Even the things you used to love seem like a chore. Yep. That hits home.
5 minutes feel like half an hour when I'm alone
"For me I play video games, not because I’m addicted. It just because I don’t want to think about real life"
Pretty much this. Though you might be able to find some temporary happiness in vices or other small hobbies like video games. But the moment you step away it all comes crashing back down. 
"The chore thing - seriously I will go to do a super basic chore like vaccuum the living room rug (6' x 6') and I think about doing it and just mentally collapse and am like ""I can't"".  Also I'm always waaaaaay behind on laundry. It's a feedback loop because you feel shitty because you're not taking care of basic stuff which makes you less able to take care of basic stuff.
"
"Yup, this. This is the perfect description. "
"If there was one message that I could broadcast to everyone in the world it would be this, nobody seems to understand why it's so hard for me to just get out of bed in the morning, it's always ""C'mon, getting out of bed is easy, you sleep all day, shouldn't you be full of energy?"" or ""Depression is an excuse, you're just lazy"" I wish people would just understand that one thing, when I don't want to leave my room for days at a time, it's not because I'm lazy, it's not because I don't want to see you, it's not because I don't like you, it's because sleeping away my days is the only thing I'm capable of doing with myself."
I hate sleeping when I'm depressed. Means I have to start another day everytime I go to sleep. So i slowly become more and more sleep deprived.
"No time for love, acting too meek, it's friendship you seek, but you can't speak, you wait for the peak but you're in too deep"
i thought this was normal state for anyone with a working brain. guess im just fucked
"Wait, this is depression!?! Oh shit..."
[deleted]
"For the anxiety bit, I liken it to that moment when you are caught rifling through someone's draw - that feeling as you are caught doing something you shouldn't be doing. Your heart is pounding almost outside your chest. Except the feeling doesn't peak and fade, it just stays there, as strong as ever. No matter what you do, it won't go away. No matter how desperate you become, you can't ignore it. There is no reset button. There is no relief. This feeling is you. And you are this feeling."
Oh god. Too accurate.
Don't forget the part where your family is on your case about being miserable all the time
"I've just saved this comment. Too accurate my dude, too accurate."
Accurate.
Don't forget self loathing!
I feel like this all the time but not as severe 
Can confirm. I receive medical compensation pay from the VA at a rate of 100% for Major Depressive Disorder (and Major Anxiety Disorder). This description is so accurate... so so painfully accurate.
Jesus Christ.Hits too close.
So... I have depression.
"I've been thinking about seeing someone for quite some time now, but I've been quite afraid of the possibility they'd say ""you're just tired and not motivated"" and send me away. But this description is basically how I've been feeling for the last 5 months. Gonna make the call now"
"Add to this the feeling that every conversation and interaction with other people is like a Voight-Kampff test straight out of Blade Runner where you constantly have to wear a mask to hide the dark truth and to keep up appearances of happiness and normalcy.

When you actually tell the truth to people close to you it feels like you're bringing them down and making them feel powerless and worried, which only adds to the already uncontrollably large pile of self-grievances you carry on your back everywhere you go.

Often times the only respite from walking on eggshells and playing pretend like this is isolation, but then the thoughts you distracted yourself from resurface from far back in your head (they never really left) to take center stage.

Every time you manage to break away from that dark cloud of lethargy and stagnation and aimlessness you feel like this might be the time things change significantly, but before you know it it has caught up with you to remind you that you've been through the cycle countless times regardless of the circumstances and the cat and mouse game can't stop but only periodically slows down.

Fuck depression and its invisible claws"
"if there was ever something as accurate as this - i haven’t seen it. this is so accurate, so so accurate:("
And this is what you feel for no reason whatsoever. And like an ice pick thru your foot. You can't just stop not feeling it or laugh it off. That's not how pain works.
Damn I've never heard someone say it like that but it is so true 
And it ends up making you feel worse when people tell you to just toss it aside......
"Sometimes you wake up and feel all fine and dandy, but then all of it starts coming back and you'll just wonder ""Why? Why? I didn't do anything."""
"“Have you tried not being depressed?” I swear to god, people ask that like it’s insightful, or maybe I just hadn’t *thought* of it. "
to add to this: the feeling of soaking wet clothes weighing heavy on all of your body
"That, plus exhaustion and pain, everywhere, for no reason. Everything is work, even eating, and all you want to do is sleep. Like the last time you had a cold or flu, but all the time. Now try and figure out when you do get sick if you're actually sick or just depressed again, since it's an early symptom (at least for me). 

This is how my hypothyroidism hid for so long. It feels like that."
"This speaks to me in a different way. 

I'm going through finals right now and my boyfriend was trying to help me study for math. I flipped out. Had a major depressive episode - huge crying jag, all I could say or think was how hopeless and worthless I am and how I'll never be able to do anything, hold down a real job, my world will just continue to be bullshit and I'll never amount to anything.

I've had depression recently, but haven't had a breakdown like that in a long, long time. Having to study for hours about worthless, dry, terrible information that I know I won't retain, doesn't interest me, and will more than likely fail. I have no interest in the subjects at hand. I have no interest in having interest in them. I can't focus because I just don't give a shit about what I'm ""learning."" 

Then I'll take the tests and my test anxiety will absolutely crush me. Again, likely failure. 

And now, here I am, at almost 6 in the morning, lying awake, because I just don't care to sleep. I haven't felt this depressed in months. I feel useless and worthless. All because I'm freaking out over tests and projects I have more than enough time to adequately prep for. I just want to sleep, but at the same time, I don't. 

So the feelings you describe? Sums it up perfectly, both figuratively and literally. It's a weird place to be in right now."
Forgot the one or two days a year you feel human enough to understand how much better you COULD be feeling the rest of the time and how bad that is
"This was all too accurate for me... Along with that there's, not wanting to get out of bed because the thought of even being awake or moving gives you anxiety. And constantly drowning in self doubt. Feeling heavy and unmotivated to do even the simplest of tasks, like showering, brushing your teeth, or even eating... Everything just becomes insanely hard to do. Until you just don't DO anything at all..."
"The blanket, dude. I once used the analogy of a heavy blanket made of steel wool. It itches like crazy and it weighs you down but you can't take it off, you just wear it everywhere like a cape and pretend you're fine. "
"all while people telling you that sometimes they are sad, too"
"Wow, I wish I could upvote your comment more than once."
If I was rich I would have glided you

"sweet, fam. gonna save this one."
"Pretty accurate for me. I am incredibly fortunate because I have a very supportive partner and I have found a balance of medication that works for me most of the time (it was a long road to get there though). I am in no way saying medication is the answer, it is diffident for everyone and I am a proponent of people doing whatever works for them. 

Thank you though, for so clearly articulating the amalgam of emotions, sensations and pressure that we face in varying degrees every day. "
"That hit right in the feels, spot on! "
"Spot on. Unbelievable writing, you have a way with words!"
"Also from personal experience, throw in the anger of a thousand wrongs being committed  and the frustration that could only come from the entire world being against you for no valid reason and that's the brew I'm experiencing"
True.
That's horribly accurate.
so i'm not depressed?
"Also, the extra layer of depression added by the knowledge that you have no way out. Unless you live a full life, a lot of people you really care about is going to hurt really bad... "
"Dude, you should be a freakin' poet!"
Holy shit... This is the most accurate description i've ever read. This coming from someone who's been depressed for years
"As much as it hurts to read this and know exactly what you mean, I apreciate a good description. Its so hard for people to understand, and its the only thing that ever acually helps, if even just for that tiny moment."
"I really feel the apathy thing. It's like I've failed, and given up, but won't stop chiding myself for it. I just feel so unfulfilled and so unable to put the effort in to seek it. At the same time I feel frustrated at my situation and inaction. I have the feeling my situation is mild in comparison to many, so I have no idea how others deal with it. "
Well this brought back some painful memories... so very accurate.
My sister has depression and she's been taking pills or some medication for it. Do you know how this effects the depression? 
"I've never seen such an accurate description. Seriously, accurately describing depression and all of its negatives is really hard. You've managed to make it concise really well! Thank you so much for submitting this."
"Fuck, that's way too accurate."
"Perfectly articulates what I came here to write, thank you"
Well fuck. Reddit has diagnosed me with depression
I get that feeling so intensely for brief periods of time- a few hours maybe but can last up to a few days.  Then like a light switch I feel incredibly good and unstoppable and I'm in like hyper-drive and nothing affects me and I get so much accomplished.  I'm starting to think something is going on and I have for years but I never talk to anyone about it.  Feels like a constant roller coaster in my emotions and outlooks independent of my circumstances. 
"That's one end of the scale. That's one end of the scale sometimes actually.
Depression isn't necessarily constantly ""on"". If it's that bad it's probably ""on"" most of the time and it sucks.
My depression, which is very mind consists largely of periods of melancholy that can last hour to days. These periods can feel like I've just received bad news to very miserable. The strange part is that you know it isn't so bad but your brain wants to be in a depressed state. It's frustrating.
Also Im lucky enough to not feel anxious. Almost ever. Even when I should.
And theres a million different people who experience it a different way each. "
Words can describe it I guess. 
The accuracy.. I'm getting chills just reading this
Sounds about right to me.  Add in the fact that you'll be ruminating over these feelings and regrets nearly constantly as a background level of stress...living in the feeling without realizing it or knowing why
"Congratulations, you summed it up better than I ever could've "
You just explained it better than I ever could of when I was going through it. And mine was relatively mild. Jesus. I love you.
"And then imagine that you always have 2-3 people who are too lazy/incompetent to offer actual support or help, so when they realize you're struggling, their first response is ""Are you taking your medicine?"".  
  
Because, you know, medication is a bunch of magical pills that instantly cure you for x hours with a 100% success rate! /s"
Amazing how much I can relate to this. 
Yikes. You talk words good. 
It's a bit comforting to know at least someone understands. Thanks OP <3
"Too accurate. This is real, and it's awful. "
Jesus that's way too accurate.
"If I had money for gold I would give you another. This is just the description I need, as my boyfriend knows that I am clinically depressed and knows it’s a really bad thing. He has seen me break down many times and would comfort me but didn’t understand why or how I could possibly feel such a way. He doesn’t understand what goes on in my head and what I feel.

This could help him help me, and I’m showing it to his as soon as we get up later."
"I would add to that this scenario:

Think something you truly enjoy doing, something that you are passionate about - like a favorite current popular television show. You love this television show. It's literally part of your identity - people who know you know you love it. You have a bunch of merchandise on display from the show. Family is always buying you presents related to it. 

Now imagine you just can't get into watching the show. It just happens one day; Everything seemed rather normal but when it came time to check out the new episode, you just couldn't bring yourself to care enough. And you feel bad about not caring. You look at the merchandise you've accumulated and wonder why it has no appeal anymore.

New episodes of the show are airing and the community you're a part of is discussing those new episodes, but you can't be bothered to watch them. You'll lurk the websites and subreddit, even engage with people who are talking about it, but the truth is you haven't felt like watching it in quite a long time... and you feel terrible about that.

A piece of your identity has shattered off, and you can't explain why. You feel absolutely terrible about that. What's worse is that you have all those little reminders around you - the merchandise, the online community, the family who supports your enthusiasm for the show by getting you more stuff... which all just compounds how terrible you feel about not being into it anymore."
"I think that phase where you hate yourself and have all those damaging thoughts is still somewhat better than that horrible dull feeling of full blown depression. For me my worst phase was just lying in bed with that grey dullness in my head and no thoughts at all, not even hate. Just dull greyness. Even going to the bathroom was exhausting as hell"
 often the only escape is sleep.  That's only if you can...
"Interesting. I wouldnt say I didn't wonder if I was depressed, but more if I needed help. Reading this description I think I would say that this certainly didn't apply to me. I think this is why people have a hard time with someone saying they are fighting depression. Everyone has ""shades"" of these feelings, but dont really experience them as you've described in such a crippling fashion. Cheering up, feeling better, and tossing them aside are what people who dont have depression would do. They classify it as depression when they are instead depressed momentarily and will get over it. 

For me I get into these minor depressive states and just dont feel like doing anything. I lose interest in things I am interested in. I start doing them out of habit but just feel no emotion about that thing. For example I love hockey and I've got season tickets to my local team. Sometimes I'm super hyped to go. Sometimes I just could care less. Its the care less times when I've got other things that are giving me anxiety and making me feel the pressures of life that make my interest wane. Your description makes it more akin to the constant oppressive state where almost everything is colored by these emotions. 

TLDR - Being depressed =/= I have depression."
"That and how people comment on how often you smile or not.  Also how 'you aren't really trying.' and they don't understand why you feel depressed.

It's like one awful sing stuck on an infinite loop.

Couple that with anxiety and my lonikoness and I get closer to going to a shooting range to end it day by day.

Only reason I don't yet is I think it might kill my parents."
I cried a little just now.
woah that was accurate. I feel my anxiety rising just by reading this
"For me, it was total apathy. Apathy towards my job, myself, my friends and family, the stuff I enjoy. I worked my grandmother, a person who loved me very much, go from normal, to complete dementia and on her death bed within a weak. I held her hand as she babbled and cried about random nothingness and watched my own grandmother deteriorate into nothing but catatonic and I felt absolutely nothing. When my uncle committed suicide, I felt nothing. When my dad was strung out on drugs and needed a place to stay, I felt nothing. Its just nothing inside. The only thing I cared about remotely was myself. Complete deadness inside. People didn't like me very much once they knew me for more than a week. "
"Fuck me dude. Your last few sentences describes how I feel pretty much perfectly. I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for more than half my life. You just put into words how I have felt for so many years. I want you to know that it helped.

Thank you"
Damn. Spot on
"I know I’m late to respond here but god damn, you hit the nail on the head"
Christ... too real.
"Now let's add the assumption that everyone hates you.  Maybe a few ppl stick around because they feel like they have to, or they pity you.

You isolate yourself because you don't feel they should have to carry the burden that is you."
"Close, but now add every single mistake and thing that went wrong for you and convince yourself every bad thing that has ever happened is because of you."
That gave me anxiety just reading it
"I've been dealing with this shit my entire life, and I couldn't have worded it any better than this. Spot on description."
"I don’t believe anxiety is a part of depression, isn’t that a separate thing? "
"well, I was definitely depressed  a month ago. Funny how we can feel miserable but still not know if our feelings are ""real depression"" "
"wow, thank you. this is good"
"My anxiety usually melts away with the apathy and empty headedness. Instead I have bone crushing exhaustion. After sleeping for 3 hours or 24, if I try to get up it’s like there is a weight on me that I can’t lift. I struggle with it. I’ll go so far as to throw a hand out and scrabble at air. Try to do a push up off the mattress. But it’s almost like the sheets are strangling me, and my body is too heavy. Arms won’t rise. Legs won’t move. And the mattress is magnetic. And sleep is dreamless. Instead, waking moments between sleep and wakefulness stretch out forever, and are full of lights too bright for my eyes, and sharp sounds that emanate from inside my head worse than nails on a chalk board. I remember trying to yell and call out to family members, who say they didn’t hear anything from my room. Thought I was having seizures for the longest time. 

Then add all of that to your cup of unpleasantness :)"
"Holy shit....
Are you okay?"
Just reading this gave me anxiety like crazy. 
"Yes, and the guilt.  The guilt for not being happier, the guilt for not accomplishing the things you need to.  The guilt of not ""snapping out of it."" Guilt is like the weirdest of all the emotions and I think makes you do the most un-like-yourself things."
The safest way to only temporarily relieve yourself is to cry uncontrollably.  
/r/bestofreddit
"That’s it, we’re done here... you win the thread. :|"
"I especially agree with the first part. In fact, my doctor thinks I seek out depression because I'm so bored and apathetic that any human emotion (in this case sadness) stimulates me."
The worst part is that you are so lost in it that you don't even realize you have the issue. Takes time to understand what's going on 
" That's not depression, that's everyday life. "

"The worst thing about it is the sheer lack of ability for other flavors to pierce through the aftertaste of your drink, to extend the metaphor."
"This is an incredibly insightful and vivid description. I don’t have depression myself and don’t think I ever have, but I’ve been trying to understand it better so I can be educated about what it’s like if I ever did encounter depression in one or more of its many forms in my life. This description was incredibly helpful, it really lets you feel the weight and dread that those with depression have to deal with all of the time.

Thank you."
This is so accurate. It is an exhausting thing to deal with and it's a terrible cycle of wanting to be better and feeling guilty for cancelling plans and ignoring your responsibilities so then you feel worse about yourself and you just keep spiralling downward. 
"Christ, as someone with depression this is probably the most accurate thing i've ever read, and the worst part is there are days you feel happy, but your mind isn't, so you are still in depression purgatory. Some days especially rainy or snowy days, i'm fucking useless against my best efforts  :/"
"Thank you for putting into black and white such a difficult disorder to describe to someone, that's never had to deal with it.

I've tried multiple times to explain it to my wife but I always come up short, and end up describing a feeling that seems easy to push aside or get past. 

I think part of the problem is that once you really start exploring your emotions and try to describe them to someone else, you get weighed down with the depressing feelings of guilt and shame before you can fully explain them...

Or at least that's been the case for me."
Comment save for later
"I've been trying to find the words to describe it for the past 9 years.

Thank you."
"Thank you so much, I could never put this into words."
That is literally amazing how well you described it..
"I want to thank everyone for all their additions to the scenario I painted above - I know I barely scratched the surface of the complexity! The outpouring of real experiences, I hope, will help both those suffering and those who want to help us. As I said to another poster,

We're all wandering through this long dark tunnel. The least we can do is hold hands.

To all those currently in the midst of depression, mild or severe, or any other mental illness - you're not alone! You have worth and are worthy of love and mental peace. Thanks again, everyone!"
"This is the most accurate thing I've ever read to describe depression.
Add in physical pain, severe anxiety, and insomnia, and you have my life for the last 11 years.
PTSD sucks"
i was just going to say it feels depressing. 
"Exactly and it feels like everything that enters your brain is negative towards you, even good things turn to bad things and bad things became way worse to you than they should be. It sucks  "
Oh my god.  I just realized I'm depressed.
That is just too damn spot on. Now I'm depressed about the symptoms of depression.. The cycle never ends. lol 
Describes it so much better than I ever could. 
"This.. is actually extremely accurate. For me, personally, I would also say there's that weird, kind of out of it, foggy feeling you get whenever you have the flu. That sort of disconnect with time? That coupled with everything you've described is how I felt when I was depressed. "
"I don't know much about depression but I always hear that these are the type of thoughts creeping in

Memes aside, I always wondered why one cant just opt not to think about that time they were apathetic to something / hurt someone / nervous. And if those thoughts just come, how hard is it to stray away from that line of thinking and instead remember more fond memories of spending time with loved ones / that present you got once from a SO / anything happy in general?

I sympathize with friends who have a hard time battling depression by trying to get them to go out, basically trying to help them think about anything else by keeping them busy with board games or sports. In a way I would like to think of it as unloading what they're trying to cope with and instead have them carry a lighter bag of ""no pyro, you're definitely evil, dont let him on this quest. He's gonna fail it!""

But I do fear of times when a person who is battling depression is left alone to their thoughts.. What can they do to get away from them?"
Also your clothes are all wet and you only have cardboard to eat. 
Huh. TIL I probably have depression. Let’s just add that to the list of shit I need to take care of. 
Carry it around like a huge weighted blanket sewn to your skin. That hit home
"Couple depression with insomnia and it's hell. You don't even get a break, it's just being numb and being numb and exhausted. "
This is very accurate
"I’ve heard it said that everyone else thinks you’re in a hole up to your ankles, while to you it seems like you’re in a hole up to your neck. "
"Makes sense why it's called depression, cause it's like your in a depression in the ground"
"So like being a weak fighter, that can't cut it against good opponents?"

Also keep in mind so many people feel like this inside and expend all their energy every day making sure no one else can tell.
This one resonates with me the most. There are different kinds of depression or the way it expresses itself. Your reply hit home.
"""How does it feel to have depression?""
""It doesn't."""
"That void created by the lack of emotion can easily be filled by negative emotion, too. Especially anger, and hopelessness."
My exact thought process. EXACT! 
"If you're like me, eventually crying stops.   
I rarely cry and it's usually silently and feeling empty.   
"
That was equal parts beautiful / awful.
"It seems like a really insidious condition as it feeds on itself, and the fact that you're experiencing depression makes you even more depressed as you explained it.

I've never been depressed myself, or at least not severely, or never for a long period of time. I have felt some of the thing you've described, but never reached that ""nightmare mode"".

I think setting objectives for yourself would be the first goal. It seems impossible because of that overwhelming feeling of exhaustion you described, but it could be as simple as ""get out of bed today"", or ""eat something"", or ""take a shower"". Then you can feel some satisfaction that you reached your daily goal. And you build up from there.

It's difficult, because you have to switch to a positive mindset. We all know that dwelling on past mistakes does nothing to help us. Our appearance is what it is, and even if we don't like what we see in the mirror, swearing at ourselves doesn't change anything.

Taking action is the most important thing to snap out of depression, it would seem. But to take action, the cycle has to be broken. To break the cycle, you have to stop feeding the depression. I think accepting the fact that depression is a serious condition, and you're not ""a wimp"" for feeling like that is a first step. That's already that much weight off your shoulders.

I never feel unhappy when I have a goal. I work towards reaching that goal. Otherwise, life is meaningless. We could just sit there and wait to die, because we'll die anyway. Or we can take action, live the life we want to live, and be happy. Inaction is the worst thing that could happen to a human. That's why they even have activities in prison, and that solitary confinement is the worst kind of punishment after actual torture and death sentence.

I'm sorry, I'm just kind of laying it out, and emptying my mind, maybe give some pointers to people. But I could never help. I have never suffered from deep depression, and it's an internal process anyway. Everyone's depression stems from something different, and they have to find the source of it, to try and address the problem."
You have a way with words. Very well said.
"Also feeling nothing inside leads to learning how to mimic emotions to near perfection while simultaneously feeling nothing, the more you turn off your emotions the harder it gets to turn them back on, it truly is terrifying but you dont have time to think about that while going through it, all you focus on is how shitty you are as a human bieng and nothing you ever do will be good enough to redeem yourself of past actions no matter how hard you try"
"Sometimes I think about how easy it would be to just die. I wouldn't have to deal with anything anymore, I'd just be finally peaceful, I wouldn't hate myself anymore, I wouldn't hurt so much. I don't want to kill myself but sometimes I just think about it."

"Wow, your analogy with the lottery in the third paragraph really struck a chord. Its nice to hear that bundle of thoughts and emotions in a concise understandable way. Thank you that's really cool. 

Cheers🤙"
"Man, my mom shared with me last night that her friend committed suicide on Monday night. She was a 50 year old woman with two kids in their twenties, had been married to her husband for nearly 30 years, had a great career in a very high position...thinking of people like her or people like Robin Williams really makes me think ""If **you** ended it all, what the hell kind of chance do I have in overcoming the black dog?"""
"Everyone is commenting on the suicide party as resonating, and I agree. However, the last part is what really kills me: feeling like a shell of my former self"

Damn the suicide thing hits the nail on the head

And yet you feel obligated to still pretend to be that person... and it sucks even more energy out of you..."
That suicide / lottery thing is spot on. It's not like it's going to happen but it just feels like a release to imagine. Hope you feel better dude 
You just described me.
"Fuck me...every word of this rings true. That is exactly how people describe me. And because of that, it makes it even harder to muster up the energy to hang out with people, because I know I can't be that guy anymore and that people who think they like me will realize they don't anymore. "

"This is a pretty good description. I've always thought that depressive episodes feel like suddenly breaking your leg (metaphorically) and this also explains why people who are depressed like to hide it, and are really good at hiding it. It feels like no one can help you, and most of the time if you tell them, it just results in a negative interaction, so why so serious? put a smile on that _FACE_."
"> You know why everything hurts, but that doesn't make it stop hurting.

that's something i've tried to explain to my friends.

"Same, I need a therapist, too. I'm arguably in the perfect job I need to advance to the career I've strived for for ten years, but I suddenly have no ambition. These assistant jobs have eroded me to nothing, and i think that it's because I stopped seeing a therapist when the gigs got more complicated. And even though my body has been advancing my career, my brain has been distancing itself more and more, and it's starting to take my body with it.

Gaaaah. I really need a therapist, too. "
"Do it.  I went to my first therapist 6 months ago and have changed drastically in those 6 months.  Don’t feel married to your first therapist, find one who makes you feel as comfortable as possible.

Therapy is a relationship between two people.  Don’t rely on him/her to fix your life, only you can do that.  What you can do, is push yourself to be a little bit better every single day, and know they’re there to keep you motivated and help defeat the negative energy depression brings by confronting those feelings instead of burying them.

Since I started therapy, I’ve lost 40 pounds, my social execution has improved drastically, and while I’m not happy go lucky every day, it’s a vast improvement from where I was.

If you need advice or want to talk, PM me.  Everyone should get this kind of help, it quite literally is life-changing.  But, be very careful not to pin all of your hopes on it like some antidote. "
"You should, im in the process of going to one, and it scares the shit out of me. But I know its the right thing to do"

I'm here at the minute. Everything I do or don't. It just doesn't matter.  "
"I started seeing one recently and I second that idea. If you have insurance, call them and see who you can talk to that they'll cover.

Sometimes employers will have mental health programs too."
"Do you ever get distractions? I only get to see my SO on weekends, and not each one at that, but sometimes it allows me to forget, just for a little bit how much nothing matters."
...oh
"This is how mine manifests. XH didn't believe me when I said that I thought I was depressed because I didn't cry all the time. He didn't understand that, to cry, you have to have emotions in the first place. 
Then, when we were going through our divorce, and I told him I was getting back on antidepressants, he didn't believe I was depressed because I was crying. Nope. The crying came from being sad, which is separate from being depressed. Fortunately, I found a therapist, got on meds, and am on the other side of the divorce. 

I no longer wish to fade out of existence, but would be willing to help xh on his journey to non-existence!"
Also... nothing matters. You cook ramen for the tenth straight night because everything tastes like sawdust anyway. Nothing has flavor. You push it down the throat only because you know your body needs calories.

"This actually highlighted a part of depression I didn't grasp before. Not wanting to improve. Not wanting to better yourself. Not having this fire to achieve things. I thought having objectives was necessary,but I guess when you're depressed you just think ""what's the point of having objectives?"".

It looks like it's about finding that fire, and ignite it again."
Shit..
Or you don't hate yourself because the depression started before you were able to remember what normal human emotions feel like. 
"Yeah, read the title and was like ""Dang, I sure wish I was normal so I could be at a point where I wonder what depression is like."""
[deleted]
"I was normal once.  I used to care.  I don't know who this is anymore.  Was I always so unmotivated?  Is this me forever now?  What broke inside of me?  I think the worst part is knowing something is wrong, not caring, and feeling like no one else cares either.  I'm just another number.  I don't want to go see another counselor and talk about my feelings just to hear ""oh that must be terrible"" when there are no real answers for my problems."
"I care. I care about my future and I have aspirations. Sure, there are days where I feel like complete shit, but those days are usually few and far between. I try to fix flaws in myself and my life that cause me problems. I guess I feel like I have a purpose, or a need to become better, which motivates me to keep on fighting.

I understand that life may not be easy or fair, but I still try to work towards my goals in the hopes that this will someday bring me an easier life. "
"I think i just got over my depression recently because ive gained a fear of death. The thought of just not existing, never experiencing anything at all, forever, just scares the hell out of me now. Before I would want to not exist, but now im afraid of it. I think, at least for me, thats what being normal is like. Being afraid of not existing."
Asking the real questions here
"I'd like to know too. Heck, I'd probably give a lot for someone to give me the secret to being normal again. I want to feel, dammit..."
This. I've been depressed for 20+ years. I remember not being depressed when I was a teenager but that was a long time ago...
Yes. And when you have good days (which happens with depression too) you don't believe in it. You are suspicious of your own smile or laugh and you're secretly waiting to feel like you're stuck under a massive wave of nothingness and apathy and sadness again.
"This is a good description.  Whenever I get back on ssri's it reminds me of what it's like to be 'normal' and happy, and makes me realize I literally never feel like that while not on them."
Your use of the ocean reminded me of [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUGhQyqJSFc) and I realized it is totally a metaphor for depression as well. 
"Yes! This is how I describe depression. It's like I am treading water in the middle of the ocean. My arms and legs and whole body are so so tired of swimming. I am struggling to keep my head above water. I want to stop so bad but if I do I'll drown. I've recently come out of a 5 year struggle with depression. So these days it feels like I just got washed up on the beach, gasping for air. But I am constantly afraid that a wave is going to swoop down onto me and take me back out to sea. "
I just want to be the innocent kid again who was happy about everything and anything. I just want to go back in time and enjoy it once again or even tell myself to somehow prevent falling in this hole. 
2:50 but otherwise correct. 
I am here if you want to talk!
Same. And once you get out your emotionally broken.

"> a loss of appetite 

Or eating a lot"
A lot of those symptoms are extremes.
Some of these signs are clinical depression as oppose to depression. There can be something wrong with the person at the biochemical level which causes depression like symptoms. I've been there and the suicidal thoughts are the worst. They never stop and keep getting more and more louder until you want it to stop. Also you can fake being social as well. You say enough that people think you're involved in the conversation. 
I feel attacked
"Irritability was my biggest sign I was having another episode recently. I just hated everything and everyone and my self talk was pretty much ""everything and everyone sucks ad infinitum forever"".  I had my meds change and I feel a bit better now.
"
"Because you've tried things that should be fun, but they just don't do it for you. You just feel even worse because what should be fun still just leaves you feeling absolutely nothing. So there's no real point in trying to do something fun really. Just keep rewatching that same show so you don't really have to focus on what's happening, just let your mind go blank and try to drown out the bad thoughts with the tv, once every 2 shows telling Netflix that, yes, you're still watching."
"Well, this is exactly what I'm going through right now. Time to look for some more help I guess."
"Same here.  The chronic instant anger is the worst, you learn that you can't trust your emotions.  At the time, the anger feels perfectly righteous.  But a few hours later when whatever chemical gets back into the normal range you realize that it wasn't righteous and your response was way out of proportion.  So... When you get into that instant anger kinda mode, you just shutdown.  Keep silent and white knuckle through the worst of it."
"I used to do a lot of sports and exercising as a pre-teen.  I could jog 10km twice a week, I would always be a high performer in gym classes, and waking up at 6:30am for school was never an issue.  But over time, depression has chewed away at what I was and has left me as a dark, hollow sack of skin with a fake smile carved on my face.  I can barely get out of bed no matter how much I slept that night.  I prefer to be alone.  My touch with reality is slipping; seemingly regular things don't make sense.  Studying is extremely difficult and takes me twice as long to do as others, but I still get by.  I guess the best way to describe it is that I just scrape by and barely ""appear"" to be a normal person.  99.9% of the people I talk to don't know I have depression because it doesn't look like I have it.  That's until I reveal to a very select few what little I have left inside.  As a child, I never saw this coming.  I thought I would be just like everyone else: jolly and succeeding in life.  But that took a quick turn for the worse.  I don't want to die, I just want this to stop.  "
are you me :\
"Yes, I'm so happy at bedtime because I can sleep."
Thats a great linkin park song
Comfortably numb?
"Im so happy for you! Hold on to those beautiful little moments. I remember what it used to be like to wake up smiling without a care in the world, Im working my way back to that feeling. Hopefully be there soon"
I'm starting anti depressants. I really hope I can get to this point someday 
How does one do this?
Yes please
"Can I have a hug too?

Ive been numb so long and have just started getting my feelings back. They all seem odd to me, I really need a hug. "
"Wish I could help every single person that suffers depression even if I have no idea how. I understand you and you understand me, for me thats more help than going to any therapist"
"I want you to hug me, I'm just terrified of intimacy."
That's actually super nice to hear.  Thank you!
"""Grey"" is always the one thing that comes to mind when I think about it. Thinking about past times where I've had depression, the only way I can describe it is being a grey blur."
"This is pretty good
 I always get an image from that movie, the mist, im just out there alone compleatly cut off, Nobody cares im stuck in there, i cant find a way out, and nobody can find me to get me out either"
"I can second this. I currently manage to wash my hair about once a week. At times even turning over in bed to grab my water glass to take a drink has seemed an insurmountable task. It’s the most awful feeling in the world, mixed with the constant dread that it’s going to get worse somehow. "
I care friendo!
I care too! I hope you're having a better day today :)
"Regarding your last bit, there's hope for you as well. Even profound depression can be treated. Please reach out to someone."
"I think one of the things that prevented me from taking a final step is that I couldn't do that to my family. I remember casually joking with my mother once and mentioning if I was gone it would be so much easier to pay for my brother's education and she just whirls around and says, ""Don't you ever say that to me again"" in the most serious voice. 

And there's no way I could take myself out without hurting someone.  There's a hell of a lot out there about how finding someone who's died by suicide affects the people who find you or paramedics or officers and I wouldn't want to wish that on anyone."
You're very lucky you have parents that will miss you. Some of us don't even have that to hold on to. I think I honestly haven't tried to off myself because I like being drunk too much and I have some tv shows that I need to finish. 
Apathy sucks ass
"> t really made me realize that depression can make your tiny thoughts and problems into big ones that can drag you even more,

And this is honestly the worst part.

I still think back to episodes from several years ago, shudder, and feel like I want to just die, really. Not kill myself, just die.

Said something stupid last week? Gonna think about it many many months ahead.

"You sound like an empath. I avoid the news or any current events because if I think of it too long, I can't deal. I have a bleeding heart, giving money to the homeless I can, wanting to fix the world's problems.  My heart physically hurts if I let myself think about it. "
"Hey, I don't think you should just die, if that helps at all."
"I have felt this way for a long time. Pretending to myself that everything is okay. I suffered most of it alone. Every moment within my own head. It was really scary. Today I had the best day of my life because I finally feel that I have finally beat it. I walked around on my own enjoying the act of moving. The walk to the train station, the train to the city, the bus to the beach. I really needed it - but not just to do it in hope it will make me feel better at the end - but a peace within myself that we are here to live - and experience - and not to be caught up in our own minds cause that is not physical reality and not really being present. The thought of a present moment can seem like you are being present - but in actual fact you are relaying a previous thought from the past in comparison to the one you are in. I found that by watching my self as if i am part of a big crowd of people and looking from afar, I can see that I am judging myself as if I am watching a movie of myself. It would be a shame that this was my story (ie: in my own head all day and not paying attention to the world around me) - I almost feel a responsibility to enjoy my life. We are merely spirits within a body that we want to hold on to for as long as possible so that we can experience what human bodies can feel - and most importantly...MOST IMPORTANTLY ... is the ability to speak the truth and connect with other people on a level that looks past all the social constructs and delves deeper into their desires and curiosities. Thank you for sharing this detailed picture of depression and i hope you no longer feel these things. "
"How did you stop? I've been depressed for years and I don't know how to get out of this funk.

"Great post. Congrats man, sounds like you have a great perspective :)"
"The SO thing hit me a bit hard. I've found the only thing that makes me happy is being with her, and I know she loves me, but I still feel like I'm failing her. Like she's lying when she says it's okay, and that she cares about me enough to want to help. It's a paralyzing loop of ""I don't deserve your love"" but if they stopped loving you that'd make things worse because they're the only one who makes you feel happy at all"
"This kills me, and i totally agree, people see you dufferently when they know, it feels better to admit to drugs than to depression"
"Part II


Humanizing your demons doesn’t work. You try and figure out what you are fighting but it is inside of you. You are fighting yourself and losing. They aren’t real, they aren’t something you can battle or defeat they are who you are. People say you will beat this but what are you beating? It’s like a cancer, festering inside of you. You start to accept it, tell yourself that there is nothing you can do about it that the only thing that will make it go away is time. You cannot change how you feel or change the fact that life no longer brings you joy. You cannot remove your insecurities or feelings of rejections. But all this does is make you helpless, like you don’t have control. It feels like giving up but as soon as you let yourself think that you cannot control it you stop doing the things that may make it better. But those things don’t work anymore anyways. You try and keep moving, one step in front of the other but what happens when you don’t have the energy to pick up your feet? It becomes overwhelming, all consuming. It gets to the point that you just don’t care anymore. You aren’t getting better, you cannot do the things you use to do, you can barely even function. You go through the motions with no passion, no intensity, no reason besides the fact that someone has told you to. You realize that it maybe it doesn’t matter and there isn’t anything you can do about your situation. You realize that it has won and you cannot fight it anymore. You hate being vulnerable you hate that you can’t seem to take care of yourself or manage on your own. You have swallowed what little pride you had left and relinquished control. You have admitted that you need help and you cannot do this on your own. You have reached out, you keep taking your medication and dragging yourself out of bed. You go to therapy and allow yourself to cry and admit you are struggling but maybe that isn’t enough. You realize that giving up is admitting you aren’t strong enough to do this. You don’t know what that means though, you have already admitted that you are broken and cannot do this alone, what more does it want to take. It wants everything, it wants you to admit that you truly cannot cope anymore, you slowly feel all other options slip away.

You think ‘What is wrong with me?’ what did I do to make my brain like this. Why does my brain want to kill itself? You don’t like the person you are anymore. You think to back to when you were happy and keep trying to find where you went wrong, or what you did. You start to hate the person you have become, the broken shell of a human that you once were. There is no self-worth anymore, people can tell you that you have friends, that people care and that you are smart but you don’t believe it. You don’t think it is true. You are no longer the person who loved and was loved. You are no longer who you want to be. You hope the old you that laughed and smiled and had fun is hiding somewhere inside.

You like fixing problems you like finding solutions. Rational answers give you joy but this problem doesn’t have a solution. It doesn’t even really have a question, it just is. 

You look up suicide and depression statistics to convince yourself that you are not alone. You are not the first person to struggle with this and you will not be last. You don’t want to kill yourself but you don’t want to be alive either. It is passive. You know that the only way you can guarantee that you will never be happy is if you kill yourself. You tell yourself that the thoughts you are having aren’t real, that they are not true. You feel like you can no longer trust your own mind. You have to tell yourself that the thoughts it has aren’t real. Each negative thought you try and come up with a positive response. There are little ones like I don’t know what I want to do with my life, it would be better if I didn’t exist and I’ll never; be in love again, laugh or smile again, be excited for something, want to be with people but the one thought that seeps in your head like an ink stain across paper is I’ll never find joy in life again. You keep telling yourself you will be you don’t believe it. You don’t have a reason to. 

You keep having to remind yourself that it isn’t you that you are living for anymore, it’s other people. You have to remind yourself that even though you place no value on your life because to you it is no longer worth living, other still seem to care. You tell yourself one more hour, one more night of crying yourself to sleep, one more dish, one more therapy session then you stop, then you can admit yourself, then you can write you farewells. 

You keep trying to fuel the voice of dissent. The lone neuron that is telling you that life is worth living that you will get through this. That you don’t want scars from this dark time, that people care. The voice that says that you aren’t doing this for you anymore. But you are doing this for others you are making sure you don’t hurt anyone. This single voice is an ocean of millions telling you to give up, that you aren’t strong enough. You our everything into this voice, sometimes it is quiet, merely a murmur that is soon overtaken by a cacophony of doubt. Other times it is a shout above the breakers, a fog horn cutting through a moonless night in rough seas. But just as a fog horn fades so does the voice. You know that as soon as the light in the darkness, this single entity, fails that that you will also fail. 

Suddenly you are 24 and you have thought about having a last will and testament. You plan out your suicide note and think how to get it to your mother. You don’t actually write anything down, that is too final, that would make it too easy. You think about the best way to remove yourself from the situation, to tell the people you love that you are sorry but you just can’t do it anymore. You don’t want to hurt people, you don’t want to burden them. You want to tell them you are sorry, sorry that you couldn’t be stronger, sorry that you couldn’t cope and sorry that you couldn’t love them like they loved you. You aren’t mad or angry or upset and in someways you are not even sad. You are just devoid of the emotion that has been defined as happy.

That seems way too energetic for depression.
"Ya man. People are just stupid and don't understand that depression feels different to everyone.    

Glad to hear you were able to take some steps to get out. I was in the same boat in that I didn't know I had depression until I learned that depression isn't sadness. It's more like crippling apathy. "

I ended up Romanticising suicide too. I don't think that's normal for everyone but
Add to this the fact that you don't have the energy to socialize although you really wish to. Or sometimes you just don't feel like being around anyone at all. 
"Same. I feel like I constantly sabotage everything in my life, I want to reach out but it feels like hardly anyone understands."
Shun a bad neighbor.
Very accurate.
"You're lumping the emotion of sadness in with the state of clinical depression and confusing the two. You're trying to impose a logic that mental illness just doesn't have. It's understandable, but, as someone who endured a prolonged period of clinical depression and got the meds and support to deal with it, you're mistaken. But you should know that it's an incredibly common mistake to make. Being depressed doesn't need a trauma, it's a chemical fuck-up in the brain that is damn hard to fight. But the right meds and the right support structures can minimize the experience of mental illness and the effects it has on the lives of those who struggle with it. Some people are more willing to discuss it with others, and that's ok. Some people aren't willing to discuss it at all, and that can be ok too - as long as they're still getting the support that they need. It seems like it's more common than it used to be, but that's probably because we've lessened the social taboo of speaking about mental illness."
"If you don't mind, I'll let doctors and medical experts tell me how depressed I have to be to be ""depressed"", rather than take shit from you for how I feel.

Clearly you've had a few examples in your life of people using maybe overexaggerated claims of depression, but this whole post is unbelievably insulting to those who have had to live with the ILLNESS of depression for a lot of their lives."
"This is precisely what I told myself over and over and it stopped me from seeking help for 4 years. I didn't want to live and the only reason I was living was for my family. Then I stopped caring about them aswell and I found a proper plan to end my life. But before I end it all I might aswell give treatment a try and I have just begun and I hope it will help me.

My point is those thoughts that you are now telling others are the ones I told myself and it's toxic and dangerous. Unless you have a deep understanding about depression and mental illness you should not be going around spouting ignorance.

Keep in mind that  many struggle or have struggled with it and you will be sitting in classes at Uni with others all around you who are potential friends or at least people who will make your day a bit brighter. Also, stay in very frequent contact with your family. Even ask them to call or text you often to check up on you. My Mom has been doing this almost daily and it does help. That way if you start doing even worse, they can see it and help you when you don't have the will or ability or whatever it's called to help yourself. I'm in the depths of this myself right now and even writing this out has given me some hope that today may be better than yesterday. I haven't been functioning enough for months now to comment or give a reply to anything. Take care of yourself as best as you are able!  "
"No, you definitely aren't the only one.

Sometimes if I'm not feeling up to it, I'll just go to sleep for dinner. I figure eventually I'll be hungry enough that my appetite overpowers my Depression and I'll get something to eat."
"I don't eat much either. just whatever makes me not have a headache. needless to say, my condition isn't the best and my ridiculously high coffee consumption isn't helping any of that either. Well, except for the few minutes of serenity it grants. Oh yeah, and often times when I do end up eating something, I eat something really weak (like barebones sugary cereals, or just some slabs of sandwich bread) or, of course, lots of sugar. Good god, good i'll intend to start therapy."
"I used to love cooking but I don't think I've made myself a meal in weeks

oh fucking hell"
Man I was just wondering what the fuck was wrong with me.... in November i was working out and in school and like 175 lbs at a high point... then shit kinda hit the fan and ive been stressed and feeling weak and tired all the time. Today i weighed myself at 159.8. literally just a few minutes ago.... It sucks when you eat so little that the idea of eating anything more makes you want to puke
"> I thought not eating was just something I did

It's not. At my worst, I survived for a year on little more than canned goods, one can per day, heated *in the can* over an electric heater.

Sometimes I'd walk to the store and buy a pint of ice cream and that would be my meal for he day."
"Sometimes i don't feel like eating, other times i just eat everything feeling like what you described."
"I've never been ""diagnosed"" with depression. I've always brushed it away when it comes up at the Drs. There is no way I could be depressed, I am blessed with an amazing life. But based on these 2 descriptions, I need to make another appointment. :( 

Thanks for the honesty."
"Yeah, this is me. Lots of people get thinner when depressed...I get heavier. I just stop caring, but I hate the feeling of being hungry, so I'll just eat whatever is within reach/the easiest for me to swallow. Which usually ends up being crap."
"The big difference is what you eat. I could eat tons of cereal, sandwiches, etc. But if I actually had to cook?"
"18 beers, 20 cigarettes and shit food daily... Otherwise I feel worthless and hate my life. Beer makes me not give a shit about the little things."
"I don’t know why these specifically, but I just crave root beer and Diet Coke all day every day. My parents are getting upset on how much money we spend restocking our soda supply. 

And a lot of times I don’t even throw it away. The empty cans just pile up until my parents can’t handle it anymore and force me to clean. 

EDIT: I also eat an abnormal amount of fruits and vegetables though. Like, two+ cucumbers carrots and apples at dinner, and another one or two in the evening. I just don’t stop. They’re too good to NOT eat a ton of. "
"""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA..."""
"This...is...I don’t know if I can really say...msybe I should try thought I’m not sure why.

So. Last fall I started sinking in to my old and fairly constant companion - depression.  At about that time I got into a silly pointless argument with a good friend.  She stopped calling me or texting me or wanting to get together and I just kicked myself and spent a lot of time thinking about all the times I could have been a better friend, the times i didn’t feel like going out when we had something planned and ended up being like a lead weight to be lifted, all the times I was irritable, the time I didn’t jump in to defend her when someone was a jerk....just on and on.  Every little thing I had ever done wrong.  Never any thought about what I had done right, or WHY we had been such good friends for so long.   But instead I thought, she’s finally had it with me.  It just confirmed what a jerk I am and how I don’t deserve friends like her.  I tried to be glad she was free of me finally.


Two weeks ago her husband called me out of the blue.  My friend had been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer the week after I had last seen her.  She adamantly didn’t want anyone to know, and her codition deteriorated so rapidly there was a good chance she would not have known her friends or been able to converse or even sit up if people had known.  She had died the morning of his call to me.

So much time and effort spent castigating myself for probably being a jerk - and all the while she was suffering and rapidly dying.  I can’t even tell what I feel now.  But it’s not too good."
"Virtual hugs to you because you care. It most definitely wouldn't be better if you were dead. For me, please don't think that."
"Not to be an ass, but isn't that just being lazy?"
I started buying Soylent to drink on days like this.
This is why I end up eating fast food 3 or 4 times a week. 
"Agree. I am severely depressed and have taught myself some useful workarounds to set up when I have an energy peak to cover my lows: snacks and energy drinks at bedside, toothbrush and paste in every room. Multiple brooms for when you have the juiced to sweep but not to walk ten feet away and get that other broom. Garbage bags under every sink and in every bureau so rather than a pile of loose floor trash, you have bags of trash lying around. When the bags are too mentally cumbersome to walk outside and around the house, throw them out the window. "
">	The craziest part? I know that’s irrational. I feel like a crazy person everytime something like this happens. But I can’t help it.

I think this part is missed by most people that have not gone through it themselves. I still deal with depression but luckily for me I am slowly climbing out of that hole and getting better. However I still have moments, days, and weeks where I struggle. 

The moment that sticks out to me was this past holiday season. For the couple weeks leading up to it I was doing very well even with a stressful new job and not many friends nearby since they were away at college still. Then they get on break and things got even better. Then Christmas evening I was at home with my direct family and SO’s and in the middle of celebrating it hit me like a brick wall. I’m sitting there having one of the best times in a while and all of a sudden I have to start “going to the bathroom” or “grab something from my room quick” just to keep wiping away the tears before anyone noticed. 

Sitting there upset with myself because I know how much my family loves me and how things are getting better but the depression just steals those feeling from you while leaving you with the understanding that it’s irrational.

This ended up way longer than I planned but oh well "
"Sounds like your primary issue is anxiety, rather than depression. They tend to go hand in hand, but one is usually the primary problem over the other."
"I am exactly the same. Like, putting something in the oven for 30 min? Well I have to get the pan out and cut a piece of casserole, then get some aluminum foil and put that on a cookie sheet and put that in the oven... everything seems composed of a billion steps.
"
"It seems like you care very deeply for her :)

Always making sure to let her know how much you care is important. A lot of times for me, even though logically I know that there are people that care about me, there's still a voice in my head saying no one *really* does. So making sure that she *is* loved, even when she doesn't *feel* like she is loved, is important.

I would also recommend making it as easy as possible for her to accept offers to do fun things with you. Instead of asking ""Do you want to go to the movies/dinner/store?"" Say ""HEY BABE, I'D LOVE TO GO SEE THIS AWESOME MOVIE WITH YOU! LET'S GO :D"". With the first one, she's liable to think ""meh, no thanks."" but with the second, she's more likely to think ""eh, why not"". Once you get over the hurdle of *going out* to do something fun/productive, it becomes easier for her to enjoy herself. Let your energy and positivity act as a guide for her.

I would also recommend various therapies, from talking to a psychiatrist, to medication, to meditation, etc. and make sure that you're there for her and let her know that she can keep trying multiple things, even if one doesn't work out.

I know this probably sounds like putting a lot on you, and I can imagine it's very stressful to be around someone who it's Depressed a lot. Not everyone can handle it. But it seems like you truly care for her, so I would recommend being a ""rock"" for her, that she can count on to brighten her day, or give her stability, or infect her with positive energy to get her to do the things she enjoys, even if she initially doesn't want to do anything. In addition, just being there for her, being patient, and loving her on the bad days when she really doesn't want to do anything. Just having someone makes a world of difference. "
"I question myself a lot about this, wondering if it's laziness rather than depression which saps my mental energy. But more often than not I cannot summon the energy to do many things that I really WANT to do, so I tell myself it's depression and try to be kind to myself rather than calling myself all kinds of lazy slob."
"Yeah, his TED talk is by far the best description of Depression I've ever seen. Is his book good? I was thinking of checking it out."
"Yep. Love that talk. I'll rewatch that every few months, and it always hits me incredibly hard. 

Another amazing quote from it is something like:

It's a strange poverty of the English language that we use this same word – *Depression* – to describe how a child feels when it rains on his birthday, and to describe how someone feels in the moments before taking their own life."
"It doesn't have to be a scary thought. If you only do these things every once in a while, it's likely part of your normal range of emotions, or you're probably reacting to a bad day.

Depression is a maladaptive process, that can cause these things to occur nearly every day, with a few intermittent good days. It's far to much sadness, grief, and loss of motivation, at too slight a cost.

If the latter sounds like you, then you may be Depressed; but it is treatable, and there are many resources that you can reach out to for help if you need :)"
:(
"I usually think of it as not so much wanting to die as wanting to rest forever. The difference between the two isn't just semantics, as what I desire more than anything is simply inner peace away from myself."
"Fuck the breather, I don't want a break, I'd just rather not have been.

It's a Wonderful Life is wrong, there's no reason to believe that if I had not existed that the world would not have filled the void with someone else."
"I know my depression is at its worst when I become what I call passively suicidal - I don't actively make plans to die, but if I were to break my neck falling down stairs and die, well, I'd be okay with it. When my thoughts head in that direction, I know it's time to seek out additional help. "
"> I just kinda wish I could stop existing for a bit and take a breather

When I was in the worst of my depression, I started trying mindfulness and eventually found that it provided exactly this. When mindfulness finally 'clicks' with you it's like it detaches the part of you that's suffering from the part of you that's sending the suffering down the pipe, and allows you to take a breather. You can 'watch' your emotions dispassionately without being affected by them. It was such a relief to get to that state. I used to look forward to the hour or so a day I spent meditating because it gave me relief.

Vigorous exercise did the same thing - gave me half an hour to two hours of 'normality' outside the nightmare. It had to be strenuous, had to last more than 45 minutes, but it worked.

I strongly feel that being able to escape from my personal hell twice a day is what helped me eventually to clamber out of it."

"That's a wonderful way of describing it. My doc asked about suicide, and I just said I never would because I don't see the point. Life is just like a chore that doesn't really matter, and then one day it's done. "
"It's just, like... I've been working for 6 years, and it's a blur of every single day feeling the same, with occasional punctuations of happiness. I don't want out right now, but if this is life, I don't know if I can do this for another 35ish years."
Yes! Like you just want to put the game on pause and close your eyes and build up your energy. I'm loads better than I was a few years ago but I'm still constantly exhausted. 
"Life is like being forced to watch a too-loud television, and I just want to turn it off for a minute."
"As it was once explained to me, ""A large majority of people who seriously contemplate suicide don't actually want to *die*, they simply want the pain to end."
"I've literally been saying to myself, ""man I wish I could just take a sabbatical from life for a while""."
"Yeah my heaven is a big house filled with all the tech stuff I want and all of my friends, and a room with a timer on the outside so I can cease to exist for however many years at a time."
"yeah, I just want to not exist a week or two, then I can get back to life."

I once told my doctor that if I didn't wake up in the morning it would solve a lot of problems. Turns out that those few words set off big alarm bells in the medical profession. I had no idea
"I liken this to *Groundhog Day*.  How many goddamn times am I going to brush my teeth, fold laundry, and feed the cat.  What's the point?"
to be or not to be that is the question
"God, this is me. Partly because I can't believe how stupid humanity is in general. From notalwaysright, to talesfromtechsupport, to climate change/etc.. and the fact we're still on this one damn planet with no real plans to colonize the moon and mars etc. I just want to put myself in stasis somehow and wake up in a few hundred years and see if it's any better. yeah i read a lot of scifi"
"Yeah games don't interest me anymore. Also, i'm sorry if this sounds like bragging, i used to be able to write songs so easily, now i just can't write shit, also i always feel exhausted and tired. Glad you're better now, i'm starting to become ""attached"" to this. It's scary."
"I was talking with my boyfriend last night about how I feel this way with him. I love him. But sometimes when I'm bad in depression I don't care or get excited about seeing him until he's actually in front of me.

Yup. You're not alone. 
"Days are slow, but a month goes by in a flash for me. "
"It's both. The day feels like a bottomless pit of time that I don't want to fill. Then I think back on life events that I felt happy during, and it blows me away that they were back in 2015. "
"yeah same here. there are so many times where i will think ""so and so happened the other day"", then reflect on it further and it was a month and a half ago. 

sometimes i'll be reading a book, or in the middle of a project, something, put it down with the intent on finishing it tomorrow, then time just passes. a year later i'll dust off the shelf and see it there, untouched in over a year. and it's not like i forgot about it, it was always on my mind.

also, i don't sleep that much. i stay up as late as i physically can most nights, and usually wake up relatively early."
"Time crawls and you don't want to do anything, but at the same time you don't do anything so there aren't any distinct memories to mark all that stupid crawly time."
"this, people dont realise how exhausting it is till they have to cope with it. I didnt! until I've really started struggling with depression and anxiety for the past 2 years or so. Medication and therapy help a bit but it's always there.

Im moving to a new country/job soon hopefully a clean break is what i need."
I'm always exhausted and it's so hard to do normal things like work and run errands. Depression is the worst 
"Goodness! The exhaustion is awful! I am having a small bout of depression because of the weather and my energy levels have been completely zapped. I'm still taking my meds, but god damn, it's hard."
"And also, because you never “toss the blanket away,” people think that you’re just overdramatizing. What they don’t realize, however, is that you CAN’T. They don’t know how unbelievably hard you try to toss it away, but you just can’t. It’s too heavy to lift off."

I saw a great post the other day that I can't find where someone likened anxiety to being deep in a game and unable to save when the combat music kicks in but everywhere you look there are no enemies.

This is a really good description. Thanks for sharing.

"I have a step father in law who would talk shit about me to my face about it.  I missed a few days of work because of my depression.  I was living with him at the time.  He goes “I know you are depressed and all but when I was growing up we went to work no matter what.  Depression is just an excuse.”
And rather than tellling him “fuck you” I just sat there thinking in my head “I want to die”."
Don't forget about the part where tons of resources/people exist to help people with depression yet so many deny the services. 
Didn't you read the comment?

"Everyone experiences depression differently. I only scratched the surface of the complexity. Others have chimed in on the rare ""clarity"" days, the physical exhaustion or pain, the guilt...

Perhaps, if you don't have depression, you could also have something that presents as depression. A lot of mental illnesses can have overlapping symptoms and comorbidity.

If possible, speak with a professional on the matter. Hugs! No matter the struggle, we support each other. You're not alone!"
"Definitely. I scratched the surface to be sure. I'd have a couple years of it really bad, followed by mild lingerings.

It's iceberg levels deep, and everyone sinks differently. But it's all depression, and we all deserve love and support.

Hugs, you're not alone!"
Many hugs!
"Ugh the ""are you taking your medicine"" line is the worst!

I'm human. Even if I'm doing great, I'm going to have bad days. Taking medication means my bad days are just that - *days*. Not weeks, months, years of misery."
"Hugs, you're not alone!

We're all just wandering through the dark tunnel together. The least we can do is hold hands."
"I hope this helps!

When you're caught in the midst of it all, the words just don't seem to come. It's exhausting to even try, no matter how badly you want to, and even then it may not really work because depression isn't something logical to begin with. It weighs you down all the more.

Best of luck and many hugs - you're not alone!"
"It absolutely can be a part of depression, and it can also be a separate, comorbid disorder."
"Holy shit this thread blew up in ways I never thought!

Thank you for your concern. Yes, I'm well. Finding the right balance of medication, therapy, and better life circumstances have left me stable and happy for over a year now!

Those memories don't go away though. You manage it, but you don't cure it. Those feelings linger in the back of my head sometimes, when I get more stressed than usual or get more worked up. *Is this another spiral starting? Is it happening again?* I'm just lucky that I have what I need to successfully steer the waters (as best one can) should it happen. Though I'm trying my hardest to not go there again!"
"I'm sorry that's happening to you. I've been there with my fiancé, back when I was so bad I wasn't really functioning - couldn't work, barely took care of myself, couldn't really ""have"" a relationship with him.

He got plenty angry too. He was so frustrated, but it isn't *just because* of you or me. It's because our loved ones see what is happening, they don't understand and they don't know how to help - that frustrates them.

If you're going to get through it together, there's going to have to be a lot of trust and support, even if she doesn't understand the why of it. And you'll have to actively try as best you can to work to overcome it - see a doctor, see a therapist, real active steps. I waited and waited, and I just sank lower and lower. I got help when I did get a ""break"" in it, but that was a year and a half too long. It's fine if you can't - living is enough when it's that bad. But every little step can only go up.

Stay strong - you're not alone!"
"Happy to help! It's something that, especially when your trapped in it in the moment, the words won't come as easily. Your mind is just rattled from it all, and you're physically and emotionally exhausted. I have the good fortune to write what I did from a place of clarity and calm, remembering all too well where I've been and what I've managed to overcome and continue to manage as best I can."
"I feel you there, often times it's too hard to really describe it. You're hyper aware of it and yet it all blurs into emotional sludge.

I just had to break down and ask them to trust me, that I'm not okay and that I just need their support and understanding even if they don't understand the why of it all. To just be there while I fight through it, and to take care of themselves because I love them but I may not be the best at reciprocating right now.

Best of luck and much internet loves - you're not alone!"
I'm glad it helped! Wishing you the very best man. You're not alone!
"Hugs, you're not alone!"
"Absolutely! I only scratched the surface of it. When you come out of that fog you think ""Holy shit where'd the time go?"". Like you've been in a time capsule separated from reality for a while (and mentally you have been)."
"that's what I'm dealing with right now, actually. No matter how hard I want it to go away, it just doesn't stop.

That's not deep enough. Imagine a pit 15-20 feet deep. Your at the bottom of that pit. You can look up and see people. You start to scream and yell and try to claw your way out of that pit. But the people above can't hear you or they just don't care. You scream and scream until you can't scream anymore. That's when you give up and just lay at the bottom of the pit. That's the numb period. That period where you just don't care if you live or die. It is at this point that people either recover or commit that last and ultimate act.
"It's more like you feel like you're in a hole three times deeper than your height when actually the hole goes up to your knees and you could just step out of it in a bit of effort. You just see straightup wall directly before you and have no hope to ever escape. If someone tells you this they are lying or just have never been in a *real hole* like yours.

Burn out is a hole with slanted walls you have to climb. You get forward quite well but it's slippery and you slip back again and again until you've made it completely to the top. And you claw your way up and get scratched and hurt instead of just waiting a while until the hole has dried so you can properly climb.

At least that's my holes in retrospect."
"Mine is mild, but, I can relate. Like, sure, I'm happy and sociable and I laugh and all, but not that long after, I'm not happy anymore, and then I wonder if the happiness I felt in that moment was intense or not. And then I remember how hollow life is and wish that maybe one day, I could wake up and not worry about all this, because I'm happy, and life is rich and new."
"Get outta my head haha. Incredibly true. I used to watch stand up comedy a lot back in the day. I'd laugh for hours upon hours and rejoice in the jokes running in the back of my mind. Giggle to myself and get strange looks, never cared. Nowadays. I still have those jokes in my head. They're still funny. But I don't laugh. I don't even crack a smile, why bother? That huge empty gap of nothingness is occupying almost every bit of my mind. And it keeps wanting to invade more space until I'm just a ghost in a shell. Depression is my greatest enemy, and my closest friend :/"
"I had a social worker who talked to me while I was in a behavioral health unit to help me through things. She did this whenever I brought up how I was feeling down. To this day I think it's wrong for me to be happy in those kinds of moments because somebody is going to criticize me if I try to say how down or drained I feel. 

Not only do I shut up about my feelings now but as soon as I realize I'm having a good time I just.. stop. "
"Apparently when I'm so far in the hole that I'm completely flat affect/deadpan, I'm fucking hilarious. "
"Oh yes, the constant hiding it is also part of why you feel so tired, and why the emotions are so strong when they're finally released."
"I’m shit with human interactions but I just wanted to reach out to every single person that suffers the same thing as me and just... help them. How? I have no idea, I’m the broken one myself, but they are the only ones that would understand me and I’m the only one they would understand. Sometimes just a real friend is enough"
"To me, that describes depression. It is so much more nuanced and subtle than people realize. You don't just wake up one day and suddenly have depression, at least for me, it can take years, slowly creeping up on you, and by the time you realize what's going on, your deep within its grasp."
"Thank you! I'm rather proud of this. Full of typos because auto correct is the king of assholes, but good enough haha"
"It would be so easy. Turning your vehicle to fly off a bridge and smash into the rocks below, taking a few too many pills, going on a drug binge to eventually OD, climbing to the top of a tall building and jumping off....

I eventually got tired and bored of being depressed. It was a weird yet relieving feeling. It's almost like the apathy depression had given me, I somehow used that apathy and turned it on my depression. I became apathetic towards my depression. THAT is what turned it around for me. I then decided that I wanted to see any and all types of metal concerts in my area over the next 6 months. I wan to headbang like crazy and I want to buy some merch from the bands I end up seeing. Metal music totally turned it around for me.

I guess my point is that I got so annoyed with my depression that I ended up saying ""fuuuuuck you"" and got to doing things I enjoy, not things I *should* be doing as per society's standards. It's an amazing feeling when you stop giving a fuck about what you *should* be doing."
"But you wouldn't exist anymore. You wouldn't even realize that your pain is gone. Your last state would be to be in pain, before everything stops. But then again, that's a way to stop feeling anything.

If you die though, you can't heal. You can't experience all the positive things and feelings in life. Feelings are temporary, and that's really important. Two people can experience life very differently based on their outlook, and the way they feel. You might want to kill yourself one day, and feel like you're on top of the world a month later.

It's really difficult to distance yourself enough from your feeling, but it's important. If you do so, you'll realize that any feeling actually stops at some point, and leaves room for another feeling. The state you are in right now does not depict what life is, what your existence is, it's just a point of view."
"Damn, the feels. I lost my wife four months ago, and while I'm clearly very depressed (""You ok?"" comes out a lot), I spent the better part of my teenage years in this exact state. My attempt to get ""help"" led my passive suicidal fantasies to become dangerously close to violent realities. 

Dousing yourself in gasoline and almost lighting a match, attempting to electrocute yourself, the all-time fan favorite of self-disemboweling, and of course the quick and painless magic pill (a bullet) have all been very close to a real end for me. When I divulged my mental status, I was given medication that put me in a daze and the only clear thought I can remember from that time is ""You have to wake up."" (meaning kill myself)

I have done this rodeo before, this was all more than 7 years ago, but here I am again. I'm a very honest guy, so I don't promise people that nothing will happen. My answer is usually ""Everything will be fine, don't worry."" because everything will be fine when I'm gone. Not that I intend to do anything, but keeping myself alive (and moreover healthy) is just not a priority."
"Please accept my faraway internet hug? You are a great person, you find the strength to keep up the facade not to bother anyone with your troubles. That means you are strong and thoughtful. This is much more than so many of us can boast. World needs people like you, please get help and get better. I really, really want to live the rest of my life among people like you."
"I use those stories as motivation, as weird as that might sound. 

With depression, everything seems like an impossible task. We imagine if we had the fame and the money of someone like Robin Williams maybe we wouldn't be so depressed. If we had the success and happy family of some of our friends, maybe we wouldn't be so depressed. But here we are, struggling to even get out of bed and go to work. Or to put on pants and leave the house at all. How the hell are we going to make it if THEY couldn't?

And I tell myself that I will make it because that is one thing I CAN control, and I WON'T let it defeat me. I will not judge myself based on other people's standards. Every day that you and I are still here is another battle we won. And even if that's all we ever manage to do, is to just keep going, then we did all we could. But I'll bet at some point we are going to beat it. But even if we can't defeat it, we refuse to let this darkness defeat us. 

If you're going through hell, keep on going. You might get out before the devil even knows you're there. "
">what really kills me

Not the best turn of phrase, perhaps."
"I used a similar analogy to explain it to my mom (when you slam your hand in a door, you know why it hurts but that doesn't make it stop hurting) and she understood it a little better. Another analogy to use is that it's like diabetes- some days will be better than others, but you'll always have it and you'll need to manage it for the rest of your life.

...I think maybe I use analogies too much."
"took me two years and then just in November I was hospitalized for my depression. I was actually hospitalized twice in November but I'm back to going to my therapist, just saw him yesterday actually."
"If i had the ability to do it, I wouldn't need to do it"
I should as well but my work doesn't give medical right now so I can't afford it. YAY!
Hey man you too! It's worth it
I thought it was normal to feel empty and nothingness. I thought that was adulthood. until i figured out it was depression
"Do it! It's a long and difficult process, but worth it. I've been seeing mine for the last 6 months and this week I catch myself smiling again. Enjoying things again. I get excited about cooking, text friends I haven't seen in a while to have coffee. It's all superficial stuff to the outside world, but it's a huge difference for me.

Honestly, I didn't know I could ever feel like this again. And sure, I know it's something that'll stay with you forever. In October I even made plans to commit suicide, so there's still a long road to go but I'm feeling the changes inside of me. It's happening!

Please, get help. I want all of you to feel this change."
"this thread's making me reconsider therapy, but I don't know how to go about like...... finding a therapist. How did you find yours? I'm in the UK if that helps at all."
"Hope does therapy help?  I have days that I feel ""normal"" and the stress of life doesn't bother me at all.  I can reasonably think about things just fine, but then there are days where I just can't trust my emotions.  And other days that I just have no emotions.  I can't imagine how talking through it with someone would help me."
"In my experience, the anticipation of pain is often more severe than the pain itself. Shine a light into your basement. It's scarier the minute before you switch it on."
"exactly how I think its going to be, I’ve had a therapist for my anxiety and it didnt help at all. I feel like not only my therapist has to be very good in comunicating with me and somehow making me open up o them, which is initially very hard, but he also needs to have suffered depression before, everyone that talks about it without ever having felt it talks nonsense, they treat it like its the easiest thing to get rid of, we all know how easy it seems to reach out of that hole and climb your way to the top. If you never felt it, you’ll never understand it"
"Well thats the scary thing isnt it? Maybe you are normal, and you're just a shitty person who can't cope with the same feelings everyone else has all the time.

Boy, that thought haunts me."
"For whatever it's worth, I'll try to answer.

For me, my job is alright. I don't dread going to work, but I'm not looking forward to spending 7-4 there either. I'm always looking forward to doing something I enjoy. Whether it's something simple like making tacos for dinner or gaming a few hours with my friends after work, or something big like the week long trip to the Dominican that I've had planned for months.

I have a few hobbies and I have the energy and enthusiasm to actually do them and enjoy them. I have a small group of like 4 friends who I talk to and hang out with regularly, we all have somewhat similar interests.

I've also found that every so often, I get a new hobby and get super into it and almost obsess over it for a while. Currently it's basketball and watching the NBA. A few others have been boxing, fishing and DotA.

Emotionally I feel like I never get too high or too low. Most days I'm just happy that I'm me, and happy with what I have. Some days I feel shitty and have a bad day, but most days I'm just happy I get the chance to exist. I also make a very conscious effort to not let most things bother me or upset me. 

I've basically convinced myself that I'm a laid back and content person, and it works. Someone being a dick to me? Whatever, not my fault they're miserable. I have to do a job a really don't want to at work? Oh well I'll get through it and forget about it in no time. I just really try to not stress about things outside of my control.

Sorry if this is long and rambling nonsense, but that's the best I can describe it. Life is decent. I'm glad I'm not a fish or something. Being a human is really good."
"I’m really scared of not existing but that doesnt do it for me, not exising would still be better than this depressed life"
"This is the worst part – you can’t even trust your own happiness. You come to feel like your lowest points are the real you, and anytime you feel better is some kind of a lie or sham. "
"I hate good days because you are just waiting for the other shoe to drop. You know it is not the start of something good, it is just a tool of the depression so you will feel even worse tomorrow. The good stuff never lasts and in the long term does not give you a lift and you look past it to the unending future of tears and wish that the ""good day"" would just go away."
"""Some days when you're on, you're really fucking on, and your friends all sing along and they love you""

""But the lows are so extreme, that the good feels fucking cheap, and it teases you for weeks in its absence.""

Probably the best song about the feeling of depression I know. "
if you ever get out
"some are, but many are spot on.

self harm and suicidal are extremes (as in ""crisis behavior"")

the food is ""change in eating patterns""

the rest are all symptoms of more or less extreme losing of interest and lack of energy to change a problematic situation. Apathy.

Interestingly enough, the suicide rate of extremely depressed ppl is very low.  Doing suicide requires planning and you have to care enough to go through all the trouble to do it. Something which is very hard for a depressed person. Also Extreme apathy makes there aren't that many crisises anymore. a crisis means you still care.

Its when the person is recovering that it gets dangerous for suicides.

Great. I identify with more than half of them. Maybe I'm worse than I thought.
"Really random but the only thing I absolutely love in this life, apart from family, is football, love watching and playing it, if I could make it a profession I feel like I would be extremely happy and it would cure my depression, I’m still 18 but my chances are so slim of making it and my depression really makes it impossible. Sorry for the random responde, felt like letting it out somewhere"
Except in my case I’m rarely tired enough to sleep right away so I think for half an hour and just like that I’m thinking about depression again 
It's funny you should mention that. I thought of the exact same thing when I typed that.
Numb - Encore. Even better.
I can't listen to Linkin Park anymore after Chester died. Realizing that 99% of their songs are about depression and suicide. Makes me cry.
If you listen to the lyrics you can understand a little bit of the depression that Chester was experiencing. RIP 
Uncomfortably Numb
Love some Pink Floyd
At times.
You can do it! [Hug]x100000000000 <-- sealed hugs in case you are ever sad just open them and bam ezpz hugs received :D
You can do it. Never give up. It's an amazing feeling and I truly hope you get there someday. I believe in you fam stay strong.
Absolutely 
How about a high 5 instead?
"Thanks, friend.  I wrote the comment to illustrate what depression feels like, but I appreciate the concern.  :)"
"Thanks for the input. While it can be treated, at this point I consider my life to be pretty much unsalvagable. I've ruined alot of myself while depressed, and while I am still trying to find something to live for I know it isn't enough. 

Here's some advice to people suffering from depression: don't use alcohol, benzos, blades, amphetamine, etc. to self-medicate your condition. It may feel better than meds at first, but that road only leads to self-destruction and regret."
"Yep, me too."
"Thanks. It does. In the same way that one person recycling helps mother earth. Sorry, I'm being rude now haha"
Honestly i started dropping acid in microdoses
You'd be surprised how painful existence can get.
some days are dull but some days this is a perfect description 
Internal monologue while lounging dead-eyed on the floor as another deadline passes.
"This is your inner monologue, not something you say out loud. You know how when you're in the shower and you come up with really good ideas? well when i'm depressed and i'm in the shower I remember things I fucked up REALLY well and this goes through my head a lot."
"Always a good cry after. And, sometimes, a bad cry after."
"I am. like I said, I wont let depression win, even if I have to do things I don't feel like I have any energy for, just as a fuck you to this thing caused by a chemical imbalance in my brain."
The romance of shutting off the root cause of the problem 
"This is exactly my point. I respect those who are ACTIVELY fighting (meds) a REAL depression (that chemical you're speaking of) and I will never be able to understand their pain. The thing that frustrates me is the absolutely HUGE amount of people that claim to be depressed even though they're not.

Funny how I got downvoted by these people too."
[removed]
so like what do they do in treatment? tell you all that stuff isn't true? 
"Exactly bro, just look at the comments on my post... You can just tell that these people are insecure af and trying to cope with it by calling it a depression. Now they hate me for calling them out on that bullshit and it hurts them."
Fuck you in particular my good sir.
[removed]
Same. I’m worried I’ll never have a close friend again. It’s been over four years since I’ve had a close friend and now I feel like I don’t know how to actually make friends anymore. I just can’t connect with people. 
"Thankfully I haven’t fallen that far, as I’m in highscool and I am forced to talk with people. 

I desperately cling onto a certain group of friends who know my condition and are willing to help, and they slowly introduced me to people. 

Also, at least for me, video games can help, because then I can just talk about what I’ve been doing in those games. "
"about 9 for me. arguably longer, but prior to that i was in a situation where i was often forced into being social."
"I have... Been there for a month. Then the anxiety caught up with me and I stopped going. Fucking chick thought I want to flirt with her... >.> I got that stupid, I have a boy friend talk out of the blue..."
"To be fair, think about how it might seem from that friend's perspective if they didn't know you had depression. If I kept inviting someone and they always seemed reluctant to join and didn't seem too happy hanging out with me I'd assume they just didn't enjoy my company anymore unless they told me otherwise. "
"I’m glad you took the time to respond. I know I’ll eventually get over it, friendships come and go; it’s just that at the moment it kind of sucks balls because I didn’t want things to happen this way and I warned them numerous times that it would come to this and they never listened & called me crazy. 
I hope you too take care of yourself, it’s important and these “episodes” can pass if we get help. Best of luck to you! "
"I think this is the biggest thing for me as well. I’ve been unemployed and stuck at home while my husband goes to work each day for a few months now. I didn’t realize how it has impacted me until recently. 

Instead of doing something to pass the time, I’ll just go to sleep. I wake up in the morning with my husband and then head back to bed. The only reason I get up is to meet him for lunch somewhere, but as soon as I get back home I find myself bored and lonely. Instead of doing the usual things, hobbies, tidying up, etc, I’ll just take a look around at all the neglected things and decide to go to bed until he gets home. "

"> I figure eventually I'll be hungry enough that my appetite overpowers my Depression and I'll get something to eat.

This is me since monday. Half a sandwhich and salad since then and no changes. Hope you feel better soon."
"I used to think this. Until several days would go by and I still hadn't eaten. When I was in my late teens and early twenties, I would go so long without eating that I would dehydrate and would have to go to the doctor to get IVs. After the second time of this happening, I started drinking protein shakes or breakfast shakes, just to make sure I got some calories a day. It sucks when your mind is able to overpower your body's instincts to survive."
"Yeah, I get you. Eating feels like a chore, if there isn't something already made or something I can make in a few seconds, I'd rather skip the meal. Sometimes I force myself to make something and eat it, but it always feels like a waste of time."
"Yeah. Most people gain weight in college and get a Freshman 15. I actually lost 20 pounds my Freshman year of college because I was so Depressed. (5'10""(M) 165 lbs --> 145 lbs)"
">Sometimes I'd walk to the store and buy a pint of ice cream and that would be my meal for he day.

I approve... Except for the depression part."
"Anyone can get depression, doesn't matter how ""good"" your life is. Sometimes depression comes as a result of something horrible, but other times it's just a chemical imbalance."
Its literally a chemical imbalance in your brain.  It has nothing to do with your quality of life.  
"It took me while to seek the help I needed too. Sometimes depression isn't triggered by a life event. If you are like me, it's just a chemical imbalance. Irritability and constantly being tired are also symptoms. "
"Medication and therapy are both good options. The difference they can make is fantastic. You still have it, but it takes the edge off, at least for me."
"Talk to a psychiatrist or psychologist. Mental illness still has quite a lot of stigma with it, so talking to someone who KNOWS the effect it has will probably help a great deal!"
Depression isn't always a result of emotions. Mine for example is 100% a physical problem with how my body produces chemicals in my brain. You should treat it just like any other potential physical illness when talking to the doctor.
"Sometimes depression can be caused by the way you were raised. I was raised by a narcissist, so my opinion of myself has never been good at all. I'm an accomplished musician, singer, songwriter, actor, dancer, carpenter and business owner. I could never give myself credit for it. I'm still too lazy. I'm terrified of confrontation and let people walk all over me. I've found help through therapy. I suggest you do the same. "
"I flip back and forth, but I told my dr I didn't wanna know if he thought my D/x should be changed. I don't care what they call it, I just wanna get off the ride. I know I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder years ago. It definitely can't hurt to talk to a professional. I'm on meds, but they really haven't helped much. That said, I am doing much better than when I first started seeing doctors regarding the issue.  "
"So far I would rate dealing with it 10/10. I was depressed for years and never dealt with it because it wasn't like I was so sick that I couldn't do anything, but it turns out not feeling like shit all the time is way better"
"It is.  But lazy has a different context or connotation.  It's more of a return on investment kind of deal.  In this context food isn't very valuable, it provides no joy.  So if you're not going to enjoy it, why work for it."
"Great question, because that's exactly how it seems to the outside. Thanks for asking too, it's nice to see someone asking an honest question to try and learn more. Thanks for that.

Depression gives you a great deal of apathy toward a lot of things, and a lack of general emotion. Eating sometimes is a chore, necessary only to survive - and everything around that is laboured effort. It's not so much not wanting to do the work, as much as it is I don't see the point in making so much effort, because I'm just not worth it."
"Me too, I'll order in to limit my need to socialise, because it's just too much work sometimes to put on the mask."
You throw your trash out the window? That's horrible .
"Maybe I'll just do the same. I think maybe either way I end up calling myself depressed because I decide if I'm just too lazy to do stuff, I end up hating myself even more and it becomes depression."
"I don't think I finished it, but it wasn't because of the quality of the book that's for sure. My Kindle busted and I just haven't made it back into the app. He definitely has a way with words and reading it was eye-opening in the same way his TED talk was. I recommend it!"
"I would just like to go into coma for a few months, and maybe indefinitely. "
">inner peace away from myself

Exactly. I just don't want to be with myself anymore. I'm tired of her,  I don't want to hear her thoughts, I don't want to see her. It's like you're trapped in your own body and mind."
"Same. I didn't want to actually die, I just wanted the pain to stop. Not even to feel happy, just peaceful. "

"It gets better. Pursue the things that make you happy, and if nothing does, then just bide your time because it'll eventually get better. Hang in there. "
"To add to this: I feel this way, but have a family that would be left behind, so you have to add in the guilt of not wanting to live - even though people would greatly miss you if you were gone.

I'm doing much better now though. Therapy has been really helpful and I've only gone maybe a half dozen times."
"That's it, just going through the motions. I keep going because of my kids, but if they weren't around I don't think I'd have the energy to keep pretending "
"It doesn't sound like bragging. I get it too. I used to write short stories and poetry, make up little songs, sketch and color and draw, break out my clarinet and play a little just for fun. I don't do any of that anymore. It's like both the desire to be creative and the creativity itself have just... left. It's awful. I miss who I used to be."
"One thing that works for me is just breaking the routine.

Like, I tell myself that because I’m not enjoying *anything*, I might as well try something new instead of sitting around resenting the things I used to love. Something that requires me to go pretty far out of my way, so if and when I hate it, at least it’s not something that’ll sit there and mock me every day.

Even if I do wind up hating it, the adventure generally helps get me out of a rut. It doesn’t cure my depression, but it does distract me from it"

Time moves so fast when you're caught up in the state of depression.
It's the 18th? I knew January was half over but I thought it was the 15th or 16th at getting latest
"Ive been having this problem really bad too

Sometimes I wonder if im not focusing enough, or the opposite, im focusing to hard on things in my head and everything else is leaving me behind

I have trouble remembering anything too, i hardly even watch tv anymore because i wont remember what ive watched even a day later"
">it's like my mind doesn't ""update"" to a new time.

This is true on many levels. With depression the sense of time is lost, and I have no idea where all those 6 months have gone."
"Individual minutes, hours and days crawl by and I wish they were gone already, but when I look back - where did January go? The exception is when you are dreading something in particular and the time rushes at you so fast you barely have time to take a breath."
">Im moving to a new country/job soon hopefully a clean break is what i need

Try not to pin too much of your hopes on that. I've done it multiple times. It can help if you have specific triggers in your environment, but you can never outrun your own head..."
"you need to escape your head, spend less time on here and talk to new people, make your mind match your body, in the sense that, if youre thinking something, youre better off telling it to somebody else and getting feedback. Good luck to you, you may find it hard in your new country and job if you dont put yourself out there right away!"
"You may get a burst of manic energy (I get that from switching jobs) but 6 months later I'm right back where I started. I can imagine it helping when you have to form new habits in a new place, start good patterns like keep things clean, keep yourself fed and hydrated. You know fill what needs filling, empty what needs emptying, wash what needs washing. 

One thing that really worked for me, mostly the anxiety part but indirectly depression was to go on long cycles, like 2-6 hours. The change of scenery, exercise, being outside in the air and being on my own by choice helped. Just make sure you bring food and water or it gets quite miserable. But i'm still depressed. just depressed while feeling physically and mentally better."
I had depression during the last couple of years of secondary school. I can't say it goes away completely but the complete change in environment that came with university has at least helped me to ignore it for the most part. 
It definately will. I'm in high school and I was suffering from some pretty severe depression and transferinv into a more relaxed and smaller school **really** helped me.
"Yes, excitment is replaced with a feeling of dread and impending doom. Like a big amphetamine hit, with none of the pleasure. Lots of fun."
"You find excitement in that?

Hey, whatever works for you lmao."
You can replace the anxiety with massive guilt. The guilt is hardest to subdue.
I feel like in this case anxiety is being used to describe the shame felt by those of us whose depression holds us back. 
"Sometimes it seems to me like that's the absolute laziest thought my brain could think to come up with. ""Let me get up and eat, shower, clean up a bit then I can go back to being human garbage. No, that's a lot of effort why can't I just die?"""
"This is exactly how my depression is. I get anxiety every now and then but it’s usually because something triggers it, not just randomly. "
The cake is a metaphor for the fleeting distractions one who suffers from depression desperately searches for to keep the overwhelming emotional void creeping up on them at bay.

"I think some of this ""walk it off"" bullshit would happen anyway as people can't empathize.  However, one thing I don't hear often, looking down on and/or demonizing (literally) people with mental illness is one of religion's worst accomplishments.  It goes against the whole free will and intelligent design stuff if some people have it 10X harder because they hallucinate or have crushing depression etc.  Also, if you don't have 100% control over your mind and your actions (hey 14 year old girl with depression, why can't you go to the church picnic and have a great time like all the other kids!?) most religions don't make a lick of sense.  How can god determine who goes to hell if some people have the deck stacked against them from the beginning ... you know, like in real life?  
  
Not to say that people with mental illness have no agency, of course they do.  But how do you tell someone with delusions to just stop believing the beliefs they irrationally, and with little control over them, firmly believe?  You can't unless you're a moron."
"I don't mean for this to come off like I'm dismissing the problems your country has towards mental illness, but exercise is really really really good for treating anxiety and depression. (I know that's not really what you meant by ""walk it off"" but I thought I'd comment anyway!)"
"> I live in a country where mental illnesses aren't treated seriously. 

Where is the country where mental illnesses *are* taken seriously? I've never heard of one. It's the same old, ""Just stop feeling so glum and cheer up!"" crap. "

"contacting a professional is not a good idea. 
the moment i contact a professional, its in the official record, and a diagnosis is permanently attached to my name. rendering me ineligible for a number of activities i may or may not want to indulge in the future.

the better bet would be to go and get the books they read, and become a skilled professional yourself, and treat yourself. because, it is a paradox, the moment you tell someone you're willing to do that, you're instigating a chain of event that will end up with you in a straight jacket. forutnately, internet doesn't count? heh. nope. i'm fucked."
"The worst part is that they have no clue why that's a shitty response. Just flies right over their heads. It's like if someone loses their job and home and you go ""Well, did you file for unemployment?"". Yeah, thanks, champ. That doesn't fix the fucking problem."
"Oh my, thanks, but Its fine honestly, I’m actually in high school so it never really mattered, I’m just... learning? How all this dating stuff works. "
"Thanks!

The worst is when you really feel like you’re pulling that shroud of darkness off of you and then all of the sudden it sinks it’s claws back in.

One day you’re doing pretty ok and then the hello? Who is that? Depression is back in full effect. "
"I deal with this too, but have managed to find some stuff that works for me pretty well and makes it a bit better. What are you taking now if it's not weird to ask? "

"Sometimes you can't even see the light out of the hole you're in. Akin to being buried alive, with the mentally crushing weight of existence."
"For me it doesn't even feel like a hole anymore, just sort of a formless void. If it were a hole, and I were in it, I would feel the ground beneath me and see the sky above me and I might think I could climb out somehow. But lately it doesn't even feel like there's a hole to climb out of, nor a me to climb out."

"To me, I've described it as being in a tower that you built yourself. Like it is made of sound proof and bullet proof glass. You can still see people, interact a little, and sometimes feel the warmth of other humans, but you are separate. You used to have an escape door, but as you built these walls taller and thicker, it got lost. The only way out is to jump, but you don't know if anyone would catch you. The tower is so tall that if there was no one to catch you, you'd shatter. You want to trust the people below, but sometimes you wonder if they're even real. The idea of falling is terrifying. "
"Lots of people have had depression. Most of them are a sturdy lot, not all crybabies like you."
I've heard about studies that show that metal music helps people deal with depression and the underlying problems more positively.

"But you wouldn't have to feel the pain anymore. It sounds so easy and so nice sometimes to just die. Even if my last feeling was pain, I wouldn't have to keep on living feeling pain. I do see what you mean though.

I don't want to die, but sometimes it sounds really easy and nice. There's been times when I've thought about it. I wouldn't though.

Thanks for your comment though, you make a lot of sense, and it's really good advice/just good words. You really made me think."

"Honestly, just search for therapists in your area.  There are a couple of different types that do different things, but the main types to consider:

Social Workers - steer clear.  They’re usually on a surge basis and don’t provide long term benefit.

Psychotherapist - this is the traditional lie on the couch trope kind of therapist.  Oftentimes they are unable to prescribe medication so they are in tandem with another therapist who can.

I can’t remember the term attributed to those that can give medication, but usually having both a psychotherapist and this type is helpful.

Set up initial appointments with a couple you think might be good and take it from there.  Some you’ll click with some you won’t.  I’ve tried 4 therapists before I found my good combination, there’s no shame in it at all.

If you have any other questions, shoot me a PM."
"Therapy is about learning who you are.  There’s trends you’ve developed since birth that you’re likely not even aware of that can have either small or large effects on your behavior.

Therapy can have bigger payoffs for those with more baggage.  But therapy can help improve anybody emotionally and mentally, regardless of what how much you want to quantify it.

If you think you may in some way benefit, I’d say give it a shot.  What do you have to lose?"
"I read this small paragraph somewhere and I think it is very close to what you are saying:


""The thing I hate the most about depression is that it tricks you into thinking you don’t have depression. It makes you think that nothing is wrong with you, that you just feel this way because you lack value as a person. Whether that’s in your relationships, your academics, or a view of yourself, it makes you think you aren’t good enough for any of that.
'It’s not the illness,' it says, 'You feel this way because it’s who you are.'"""
You sound like a decent person and I'm glad you have a relatively happy life. Most of us in this thread would do nearly anything to feel the way you do about the day-to-day. Treasure it please.
"That sounds like a peaceful, average Joe's life, not that I mean it in the bad way. I'd like to be that happy someday. "

Welp. That last sentence is probably the saddest thing I'll read all day.
Yea I just think your paint depression with to strong of colours and not describing the finer points of depression. Like self harm is not caused by depression it's a reaction discovered to help you take your mind off things.

"Well if the old one's tanked then you will build a new life. On this topic alone you have wisdom to offer. Don't just steady the ladders of others from the bottom of the pit. How about let's do everything to get you to the top too, where you can help even more to make it.  ECT, the ketamine and psilocybin trials... whatever it takes. "
"You have just graduated with honours. While I don't know the details, I think you're strong enough to make it to a point where life is worthwhile again. But not alone. let a professional help you. It won't be easy, but better than the state of mind you are in now. let yourself help, so you can help yourself. If you can't do it for yourself, do it for me. Someone in your life cares, you said it yourself.

Stay strong 💪"
"I too thought that I have passed the point of no return and that I have to have a purpose, something to live for. Nihilism can actually be liberating, there is no need to have a goal to exist. You really don’t have to earn your place in the world, you can exist just like trees and birds exist. No-one has a say in if they want to be born. I found my real medicine in exercise (antidepressants helped me to get out of bed and to eat to nourish myself, but it didn’t made me normal), I’m not not depressed now but it’s so much more manageable."
"There are people you could not help before having this experience.  Please, if you’re ready to stop, find yourself a good group of people also going through recovery, and help them pull it off, even if you’re only helping by listening well."
I don't think any state of being would surprise me. But depression is a state where even pain would be (or is) more welcome than no feelings or despair all the time.
I guess it's different for everybody.
That's more what it was for me.
I know depression more as *sigh* ... *siiiggghhhh* with not enough drive to even actually do the sighing.

"Your first comment is precisely what I told myself over and over and it stopped me from seeking help for 4 years. I didn't want to live and the only reason I was living was for my family. Then I stopped caring about them aswell and I found a proper plan to end my life. But before I ended it all I might aswell give treatment a try and I have just begun and I hope it will help me. 

My point is those thoughts  that you are now telling others are the ones I told myself and it's toxic and dangerous. Unless you have a deep understanding about depression and mental illness you should not be going around spouting ignorance."

Hang on to those friends you have in school. I've been out of school since like 7 months back and I've barely spoken to a single friend I had in school and I've started to drift away from my closer friends. It's **way** harder to make new friends once you're out of school. Do it while you still can. Do it for yourself and for everyone like me who missed the chance.
"hum... I’m 18 and the only thing that kept me from drowning in depression was school, now that I have to start university I’m completely lost, I have no idea what I want with my life and the worst part is I dont give a fuck, cant be bothered to get a job even though I dont want to be a problem to my parents. I’m just lost dude, tomorrow is blur, have literally no clue what my life is going to be even a month from now. I would have 100% killed myself if I was one of those people who woke up to a miserable job, came back at night only to cry themselves to sleep. I think the only cure to my depression is a mixture of peace and love, but not the love I have for a family member, something different. I dont even know what I’m saying anymore..."

"I have seen elsewhere an approximate of the following:

"People think it's a character problem, but it's no more controllable than cancer or diabetes (not talking about what can be controlled through healthy living).

"Not just left behind but traumatized. At the same time of feeling like you have no purpose or meaning in life, you know if you did die it really would affect those that love and care about you. Depression, at least for me is being stuck in this unsustainable and overbearing saddness and not wanting to die and knowing I somehow have to get better for my own sake as well as my families. It's also so much more than what I've said. I guess this is the quick run down and trying to add to what you were saying. I'm so glad you are doing better!  "

"I get the memory thing, I’ve had a personal theory it’s because you’re “checked out” all the time due to the apathy element / avoiding what to you is an unpleasant life. It could also be to do with the flat emotions, I guess? I’ve read emotion and memory are really connected. I suppose that could also explain the time thing."
"This is accurate. On the smaller scale time absolutely drags, but then you're suddenly way further in the future than your mind thinks you should be. It's disorienting."
"While all of this is accurate and you can not escape your own head I would say you can outrun it. By that I mean physical activity. I suffered from depression and anxiety most of my life. I was medicated and in therapy by 17 (30 now) while therapy and medication helped manage the symptoms what got me out of the pit was physical activity. While getting your brain to actually get up off the couch/bed/computer chair (was a world of Warcraft addict in my early 20s) exercise is what got me out of the hole.

But yea. Top comments description is bang on. The anxiety over nothing and the amount of guilt you feel for feeling depressed is unreal. That coupled with your motivation to do anything stripped for you is crippling.

I have since come off medication (around the age of 25) found the love of my life and have 2 beautiful children. And while life is stressful AF now I can handle the anxiety that life throws at me.

For anyone currently locked it battle with depression hang in there. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. The best piece of advice I ever received about battling this bitch is that when you have negative thoughts loops you can not trust that your thoughts already accurate. While it took me a long time not to trust my own brain now when I recognize that type of thinking I can tell myself that none of this is accurate or true and wait untill the loop ends before allowing my thoughts to be impactful again.

Best of luck to everyone battling. Remember there are tons of people that love you and tons of people you have yet to meet that will love you  "
"Can contradict. 

Moved to a country with overall better quality of life and a seafront. I always loved sea and now I can just relax by it whenever I feel like nothing has purpose (my sister opted out for medication).

Even my stomach stopped hurting after a week, prior to that I had constant cramps (that hurt like appendix bursting - previous experience with appendicitis) and anxiety attacks.

My kind of work fortunately isn't one where asking about mental illness would be a huge red flag - in some cases it may help because of deeper understanding - and even if it were my clear history of getting professional help and successful management is a good thing to them. I'm also moving from a state with pretty poor mental health resources to one with even better options (again, being fortunate to do so).

I knew that I would get called ignorant; I just knew it would happen. It is because I do not acknowledge all these feelings people nowadays seem to have. I don't buy it and neither should others.

IF, and only IF you are truly depressed, you must tell someone and do something about it; even if it's starting baby steps. People who say they have depression but do not take meds/do anything about it can f off in my opinion.

Obviously you sought help after 4 years, so after 4 years you MIGHT have finally been depressed. But before that moment you were just not manning up tbh."

"A thousand times yes to this! I haven't been able to go to the gym for about two weeks now and that's what has aggravated my depression. The meds alleviate the symptoms, but they don't cure them. I can't wait to get back to exercising so I can really keep my depression at bay."

"If you know that edit:excersise will help you and you manage to do a bit for a few day but then miss two days how do you make yourself stick at it?

I have real trouble getting up every day. Somedays I'll roll back over when my alarm goes off and I'll hate myself in that moment. Some days I manage to drag myself up and to my weight bench . I'll do three sets of light weights. The next day I might do the same. And the day after . Then the next day I mightn't make it out of bed again and it could be another week before I touch the weights. 

I work shifts, so my roster is always changing from mornings to night so I find good sleep hygiene hard as my body clock is in tailspin. So the energy and discipline to drag myself to the bench is hard to find. Even reading this now I seem to just be making excuses but outside of telling myself to ""just get up and do it "" I really can't see a way out. How do you build the motivation up if it only takes one missed day to spiral you out of getting back on track."
"I really want to get back into exercising.  I've suffered from depression since I was about 13, medicated since I was 16 or 17 (am 22 now).  I tried to go to the gym when I was 17 or so, but eventually stopped after about 3 months.  My problem now is that I'm tired all the time.  I got a job at Sam's Club a few months ago and walking around all day while also lifting things takes the energy out of me.  The way I see it, I could go to the gym before work then be exhausted when I get to work.  Or I could go after work but I would be too tired to put in as much effort as I'd want. I want to go, but I have no motivation because of those reasons."
"That makes sense, but it's because you moved away from specific stressful triggers (as I said...). There was a concrete difference directly related to the reasons you felt as you did, not just a ""change of scenery"" or a ""fresh start""."
Can I ask you where you moved? I’m looking for a place that sounds very similar. 
"I didn't mean not to have hope. I meant that you need to always be working on yourself, not relying on that *one big change* to magically fix things.

You can make things better. I did. But I only started to get better after I stopped trying to run from it. I moved a lot, always thinking it would magically change my life. It didn't. Actively changing my own habits, however, did."
"The cake is a lie.

">it makes you feel better temporarily

That is literally the definition of a ""treatment.""

EDIT: Sorry for making the asshole semantic argument. Of course the larger point still stands; it is by no means a cure."
"True, it's very temporary. It does help a lot for some people, though. I personally don't work off depression or anxiety very well, but I can work off anger without a problem."
"If I didn't have an exercise routine already in place over the past 4 years, I am positive I would have taken my own life. It sounds like you either haven't exercised enough to get the benefits, or you've done it wrong.

It's not a cure-all, but it's far from ineffective."
Don’t forget about the miraculous powers of keto to solve...anything.
That's great. My depression seems to feed off the exercise though. Like it becomes another obsession that breeds anxiety. If I don't run 30 miles a week - bang misery. Miss a gym session? Misery. 
I mostly battled my way out by exercising. I felt better about myself and people treat you better once you start visibly look better.

"Triggered, and not the sharpest tool in the shed I see.  Good luck young one."
It is easy but I also have to go to the store and buy rice and veggies and then clean the pot after. None of that is overly difficult but I often find it hard to force myself to do that. That being said I recently have been forcing myself to work out and eat healthier over the past few weeks and so far it's going well.
"Well, when you get depressed enough, sometimes you lose the option to be a decent citizen even if you want to. You'd understand, if you ever had it that bad. But no, nobody can see my trash in the yard anyway but me and deer, owls, coyotes etc"
My dicision came down to side effects being a bitch. Everyone is different. I always looked at medication and therapy as tools to help get my brain where it needed to be to get better. Once I wasn't deep in the pit the side effects outweighed the benefits. It was a very useful tool when I needed it. Was on then for about 7 or 8 years. Many different drugs many different dosages. Eventually found the right one and it helped provide the energy to have any semblance of motivation
My 2 cents is its a marathon not a sprint. The first part is not beating yourself up when you can't do it. Motivation is hard when you deep in the pit. Keep at it. I found d cardio worked better for me than lifting but that might be just me. I was very overweight at the time and the weight loss helped. It also helped I had a husky puppy that needed to be walked very frequently
That sounds rough. One of the meds I was on did that to me and it was crippling. Speak to your doctor. There are tons of different meds you may not be on the right one for you if it doesn't allow you to do what needs to be done to keep your brain healthy. 
"Bournemouth, UK"
That doesn't invalidate his point. Exercise does little to treat many of the underlying issues that cause depression. It's also completely useless advice for people whose depression is so severe they're dealing with overwhelming fatigue it comes off as insultingly dismissive.
So alcohol is a treatment. 🙄
"It's treatment in the same sense that if you're rolling around on the floor in agony from appendicitis and I kick you in the balls, you momentarily forget about your appendix pain. But your appendicitis will still be raging when the shock of the ball kick wears off.

Just getting out of bed and thinking feels like walking through concrete while you're on your death bed with the flu. Plus depression is often a side effect of another illness, so for many people, you can't exercise. I have a tachycardia issue and have MS, so I can't exercise at all, or I get spinal headaches (migraines' crazy ex girlfriend) Medication works much better than anything else I've tried. There's a DNA test that shows what medications work best for you. It's not expensive, and the meds work so much better with fewer side effects."
"usually a treatment will help cure the problem permanently 

edit: yes i misunderstood the google definition. i like that theres more responses nicely correcting me than downvotes"
No. No it is not.
Absolutely this. It's a trope to exercise to help depression and it doesn't take it away but for myself it made it so much more manageable
"> haven't exercised enough

> done it wrong

Not to disagree but these words wouldn't have helped me when I was most depressed, it would make me feel worse and more anxious.

Exercise helps, but to develop that takes baby steps. To anyone who feels total apathy, you could start by opening the front door once a day. If you have a handle on that then walk a small way up the road and back. The aim is to build on each day but only focus on today, a lot of small steps is better than one huge leap."
"I go to the gym 4 times a week, and yes it's the best I feel. But it's not a cure or a long term solution, even though many on the internet love to offer it up as though it is"
Heh I get that during winter when I can't go out on my cycles. I get restless and irritable (same as when it rains for 2 weeks straight). Guess you've build up a bit of a dependency.
"That is 100% accurate. I have noticed how different dressing affects people's reactions towards you, and then in turn your own image.

I have been off of exercising for a bit because of injuries. Otherwise that has always been my go too. Hard hitting cardio.

I had meant more along the lines of never treating things seriously. We usually attribute depression to having too much free time. 'You're having such an easy life, you're just being an ingrate' mentality."
"That's kinda poetic, actually. Gonna keep this one for future reference :)"

Ugh but you have to go outside to get fast food. 
It's less work than waiting in a drive through and paying them.
"It is in fact. It's just that a) 50% of the time it can make you worse, and b) it always redoubles the depression when it wears off. "
"Medical industry professional here (not a doctor, but I do all of their financials and data analytics, so I’ve picked up a little bit.)

A treatment alleviates symptoms and might slow the progress of the problem, either while the bosy fights it off or because it can’t be cured.

A cure makes the problem go away, but there may be some residual effects on the patient’s physiology.
"
"No, cures cure conditions, treatments only treat them."
That is not so.
"They’re not saying it’s a cure, just a way of managing the pain. Paracetamol is a basic form of treatment but not a cure. Have a great day :)"
"True, you can’t expect someone who isn’t even able to shower to heal by exercise, but with the help of medicine it’s so much easier to take those baby steps. Having a routine helps to calm the mind and crossing things off the to-do list boosts the body with dopamine even if these are simple tasks such as “getting out of bed” check! “washing teeth” check! “eating something” check!
Crossing things off is the best feeling ever and if you haven’t done few things there is still many that you have!"
"That's because exercise is as effective as medication in people with mild-to-moderate depression, but not for people with severe depression. So since no doctor is going to tell you where you fall on that scale (and there will obviously be people who are self-diagnosed with depression), person A with depression (but mild) will tell you that they treated their depression with exercise and it can work on person B with depression (but severe), when in fact that's not the case. Neither person is wrong, per se- it *is* an effective treatment for person A, but it's kind of like expecting every cancer to have the same treatment. But you wouldn't treat brain cancer the same way you would prostate cancer, even though they both fall under the diagnosis of ""cancer"". I think the medical community does a poor job of communicating (and classifying) the differences in the severity of depression and their appropriate treatments to the general public. The good news is, talk therapy is a good start for people regardless of the severity of their depression."
Hey you should see my comment on this thread. Am quite proud of it tbh
Perhaps if you know them and know it will work. Not when you don't know what the reaction is going to be
Do I know you from somewhere? Why are you jumping to conclusions about me? It makes you seem really irrational.

"Actually I can order it online or on the phone

Usually online, so I don't have to speak to anyone."
It's not though and that's the allure of fast food. I just order and get my food cooked and done. Only clean up is tossing the trash away. Maybe my area is different but there is never a line and the fast food places are actually closer than the grocery store. Either way its not good for my health and that is why I'm trying to avoid it now.
You disagree with him so your depression is fake. New rules.

"I'm not going to debate you because I do not see you as capable of the debate itself. Again, not trying to insult you, it's an observation I made; it doesn't matter if you agree or not. I simply won't put my time in the debate with you. I would debate with others for example, the other guy in the comments that actually suffers from depression but works towards fixing it everday. He is worth the time and respect."
Im honesly convinced mine is easier as someone who loves junk food. Fast food delays my time getting home from work and I can do a 5 min cook from home.

"It may be quicker, but it requires that you do more yourself as opposed to Fast food where it's literally made for you and all you have to do is pay.

Honestly, I can see both sides of things. I've had days where I can easily throw something together using ingredients I have in my kitchen, but I'd rather order a pizza because it doesn't require any effort on my part and I can order Domino's online to avoid speaking to someone"

Your logic just doesn't hold up to me. Cooking the food I suggest is objectively less work then driving to a McDonalds and ordering food. The only reason to do it is because you prefer fast food.

"I don't have major depression....I think it's more like chronic depression.  Nothing's fun.  Nothing's worth doing.  I think if I were to win the lottery I'd just breathe a sigh of relief and be glad that bullshit is over with.  Wouldn't make me happy though.  I question sometimes (rationally) the point in living.  I mean, sure, to have children and make an impact on the world is probably the best reasons for living, but is that going to actually matter?  This shithole is already overpopulated and there's not much one person can change.  

I'm not suicidal, I have plans, but I don't think they'll have any profound effect.  I could lie on train tracks and it wouldn't make a difference in the grand scheme of things.  I could continue living and maybe enjoy decimating this planet some more.  I mean, I'm just one person, but I contribute to everything.  For good or for bad, I'm not really going to leave a mark.  My life doesn't matter, that's truth.

Now, *I think* the difference between major depression and chronic depression is that I live with this reality, whereas for a manic depressive all of these feelings hit them like a ton of bricks.  It's different for everyone, but mine is a long-lasting, mild type.  I can at least get out of bed to eat some eggs and cheese, even if I do feel it's pointless."
"Sometimes I'll be really hungry, but the idea of simply going to the kitchen and making food seems like too much work."

This video was spot on for me. 

Also, never underestimate the power of just being there for your SO.  Ask them what is helpful; do they want you to sit with them in bed? To force them to take a shower? To reassure them that you love them? 

And to echo the others, professional help.  Preferably with a well-regarded therapist (I prefer ones who specialize in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and possibly also a psychiatrist for medication. "

"I suffered with major depression (with psychotic tendencies) in my late teens, which led to an attempted suicide. 

It's really hard to explain but I just felt like my life was pointless, that the people around me would be better off if I were dead and that I was just a burden on my ex-boyfriend, friends and family. There were days when I wouldn't get out of bed, not even to shower. I locked myself away from everybody and convinced myself they didn't care anyway. I failed school, I had no libido, I dropped about 45 pounds (I was about 140 pounds before my depression), I couldn't watch tv because it bored me, I couldn't eat, I was constantly dehydrated and I was in complete denial. Whenever anybody would ask how I was doing, I would smile and say 'yeah, really good'. I just didn't want to bother people. 
I was also very risk-taking. I would get stupid drunk or drugged-up and get myself into dangerous situations. This led to the overdose. I decided one evening that it would be a good idea to drink myself to death and take about 180 pills (a mixture of codeine, paracetamol, caffeine pills, allergy meds, ephedrine.. you name it). The night was a blurr, I didn't pass out.. a friend was around and he drove me home. Thankfully I'd started vomiting by that time. 

In the morning, I couldn't keep anything down. Not even water. I couldn't urinate. I felt sick. My whole abdomen felt searing. It was in that moment I realised I didn't want to die. I got my grandfather to take me to A&E where I admitted to what I had done and was put on a drip for a week due to my liver failing. 

I lost the trust of my family, my friends and my ex-boyfriend dumped me on my hospital bed. After I recovered, I was still very messed up, quite traumatised. I was over 18 when I overdosed and in the UK that means that they don't need to support you. I was literally given a leaflet and told to go home. I could have easily attempted suicide again, but a little voice in my head told me to change. 

Without medications or therapy, I managed to recover on my own. It took a long time (about two years) but it was worth it. I just travelled alot, made time for myself, started to care for myself, read alot and admitted my problems.

Today I am 22 yo, studying Psychology, married, living away and my depression is classified as mild (sometimes it gets worse but I can talk myself out of it). Turns out there is a light at the end of a tunnel :)


"
"It's weight. It sits on your chest. Depression throws the anchor over board. Interests in every aspect of life dissipate, even hunger. It all becomes very stagnant and murky. The word that comes to mind is hopelessness, but even that implies that there is an internal resolve that will cater to the pulling of yourself out of that depth. To find hope. Major depression does not acknowledge that resolve.

I'd suggest having your SO seek professional help. Talk to someone who has an outside of the box perspective. Get the most suitable medication and therapy available.



"
"Had a short (a few months) bout a while back, wasn't a major case I think.

It didn't even hurt, it's just your new normal. When you're well, you don't really remember what having the cold is like. You know it abstractly but you can't really recall what *being* sick is like.

It's like that, everything around you is just the way it is. You can't really understand feeling better because it doesn't make sense, you hurt and that is the way it is. You just want to not bother anyone and stay out of the way, you're only ever a burden. You don't want to kill yourself, but living is just to much work. It's easier to just lay down and stay out of the way.

You eat because you know you have to, and you go through the motions of other tasks, but things fail to come together."
"It's not that I are or were sad, but I am in a melancholic state of mind. I lacked motivation to do anything exciting, like getting up and smell coffee in the morning  or go out and excercise. I also suffer from sleep deprivation as a result of the depression. 

It is really hard to give any advice on how to help her pull through, because every case of depression or major depression has different symptoms and how it affect a person. Proffesional help is maybe a solution. For me it worked to speak with my personal doctor, he helped me get medications to fight sleep deprivation and gave me advice on how to push new boundaries to help motivate myself. I wasn't even aware that I had a depression until he told me that I was on a crash course, and that was 8 years after I first experienced the symptoms. 

Be careful on how you approach this with your SO, it can be a very personal and a very touchy area. That is probably the best advice I can give you on the matter."
"I have disthymia. 

Nothing motivates me. Nothing interests me. I struggle to get up because I feel tired all the time, and then when I can't I'm disgusted with myself. I feel so useless and pointless."
"It's hard to explain. 

I would isolate myself whenever I got depressed. And it would last so long. I had depression end of middle school and my whole high school years. Sometimes I wouldn't even know the reason why I am so upset. My ex would always ask me what's wrong and I would shrug cause I don't know. A wave would hit me. I lost motivation to do things I loved to do. I couldn't sleep well. 

Then it would get to the point where I was just numb. I wouldn't eat for days. My stomach would scream for food but I wouldn't feel hunger. I didn't give a shit about anything. Didn't talk to my parents, and stayed in my room. It was hard to picture why I am still alive when everyday was the same, wake up and feeling nothing. But I was also to scared to let myself be happy, once I notice I was happy, I would get depressed. I don't know how I would comfort my SO if they were in my position. But my ex helped me get through depression by just being there. He used to be depressed and used to harm himself like me. He also helped with my eating disorder.

I was so good at hiding it though, because that is how people saw me. People knew me as the girl who smiled all the time and laughed at the littlest things."

"My depression is almost like a living thing, it wants to survive, and thrive. It will try and trick me into believing that things will never get better, or that even if they do I won't be happy. It will tell me that the good things in life aren't that good and that everything is meaningless. It will build walls around me and keep me from seeing anything outside of my depression. It tells me I'm worthless. It tells me I'm stupid. It tells me to stay in bed. It tells me I'll be better off dead. 

I still get up every day and go to work. I do it because at some point in my late 20s I realized that this wasn't something everyone goes through. It wasn't ennui, or angst, and I did deserve better. 

I can tell you right now, there is no chance in any way, shape, or form that you can ""pull your SO out of this. They need professional help. They will only get better when they want to take those steps to get better. You can suggest they get that help but by no means can you save them, or force them into getting it. Just be supportive, and understanding and patient. 

TL:DR, suggest your SO seek out professional help, be supportive, and remember that they can't change until they choose to."
"I hate it, Then I hate myself, but I love it...... because it makes me feel alive...,but I hate it."
"I can't even remember where I found this, or who to credit it to, but I seen this piece of text somewhere that just made me feel something in my chest when I read it. It describes perfectly to me how I've felt. 


""You asked me how depression felt, and this is all I could come up with. 


It feels like
I'm walking upstream
through a current strong enough
to pull me under four times over. 


There are others with me,
but they are walking along the banks
telling me to ""Just get out of the water.""
But instead of extending a hand in help,
they just move on and leave me behind. 


Every once in a while I find a rock
that is strong enough for me to lean on,
and I can rest for a bit. 


But the rocks always get tired of holding me up,
and when they let go I'm left drowning -thrown 50ft back again. 


And nothing is harder
than standing up in that current,
when everything in you
is telling you how much easier everything would be, 
if you just let yourself get dragged under."""
"I'll address the experience of trying to talk to my friends about it, since plenty others have commented on the experience itself.

First and foremost:  

You don't know what it's like.  That's not an attack or an accusation, it's something you have to remember.  Depression isn't like that time you were super bummed or stressed out,  and you really can't just will it away.

The thing that bother me most when I reach out to non-depressed loved ones is that they never really 'get it',  but they always think they do, mainly because it's a difficult experience to convey, especially when the terminology is also commonly used to explain more transitory experiences that everyone experiences.  You have to remind yourself that just because it's SOUNDS like something you've experienced, it isn't.  

The easiest way I can explain this is:  if you are about to say something starting with ""you just have to..."",  you've got it wrong.

A person with depression can't ""just"" anything when it comes to dealing with depression.  They can't ""just let it go"" they can't ""just tell yourself X"".

Also, please please please don't fall into the trap of telling them things they should ""be happy about"".  They know.  Depression isn't a lack of perspective,  and these statements usually just make them feel worse, like ""You don't have the right to be depressed"".

Every case it a little different, though, and this may not apply to everyone,  but the basic idea that you need to understand is that no matter how similar something they're describing sounds to something you've experienced, the 'solution' is not going to be the same, especially if the 'solution' is just to 'buck up' or somehow WILL the depression away.  It doesn't work like that."
"I have a really extensive history of it but I don't want to overshare, so I won't go for anything too intense. Something that really sucks about the big depressive periods for me though, the ones that last for very long amounts of time, is that while talking your issues through with someone can feel amazing, like taking a huge weight off your shoulders, you also get this awful crushing guilt from it. 

You get some temporary relief from your shit, after keeping it bottled up for so long, and then it comes back to haunt you. No matter what you say to that person from then on, you feel like a huge burden and always feel like you're just an annoyance in their life for putting your problems onto them.

You're a good person for trying to be there and help your SO, for sure. I hope that they can get the help they need and pull through."
"Mine is more of a mind-set that God hates me, or is punishing me.  Not just passively ignoring, but actively out to hurt me.   The man I love choose someone else; I don’t get to have that life I wanted, I don’t get to be happy, Gods doing.   Why should I bother trying to do anything if God is not going to let me have it.   I mean seriously, if God doesn’t care, what’s the damn point?  That is my mind set right now.    And in case anyone’s wondering, yes, I started therapy last week.  "
"On point with those that said seeking professional help, if she hasn't already. I dealt with a relentlessly deep depression for over 15 years before I finally mustered up the courage to tell someone (my mom) that I truly felt like I couldn't hang on anymore - like I was dead but physically alive. I didn't see a meaning in living, and living day to day was work. I wanted to just end my ""life"" for years but didn't know how. (Side note: In a way I still have this feeling today - I really don't see a point in life and every day is just sort of like, ""Okay... I'm here... ugh."" and if I died today it would be a relief and I wouldn't regret it. The difference is the depression feelings just aren't there anymore.) The best way to describe the actual feeling of the depression is to picture a clothesline running through the inside of your chest; then picture one of those giant, 1000 lb. anvils like in the roadrunner cartoons hanging from it down through the center of you. It feels like your insides weigh a million pounds and could cave in at any moment. Any time I was in a situation where I was supposed to be happy, I had to fake it. I tried so hard to find some enjoyment in good times, but I just couldn't. When I was younger I would stay home from school and just cry and cry for no particular reason all day long. Depression does run in my family, but it was also a result of situations I was experiencing in life as well. Anyway, I finally went to a psychiatrist and was officially diagnosed with the depression and a mood disorder (which we had already suspected). I'm not big on taking medication at all, but decided to try one out for just the mood disorder and see if that helped the depression at all. Luckily it did. After a few months on the medication, it felt like that anvil wasn't there anymore and that my ""normal"" mood was at an even keel rather than under rock bottom and 50 feet of sh*t. Depression can feel different for everyone, but there's always the underlying theme of complete despair and misery. It's really great that you're asking first-hand experience to try to get an idea of what your special someone is going through - props to you for really caring and actually wanting to help."
"I like to think of myself as a problem solver, and the biggest problem in my life is me. Very hard to justify the immense drain I am on the world around me, feel guilty for burdening everybody. Just want to hide, just want to go away."

Sleeping is an issue with my depression it gets to a point where i over think things that i said or did years ago. And end up not sleeping for a day and a half or so and just pass out from exhaustion. And then there's days where getting out of bed is just to much.
"Well the only thing u can do is be there for her and try to make her forget the world ... Forget the problems .. Thats the best .. However sadly somtimes with as much professional health and as much love as there ultimately u have to pull trough by yourself , u have to find things to are worth living for , and u have to convince yourself that things will get better in the future , cause thats the tricks about depressions, they trick u into believing that things will always stay the same , that u will never get happy , that u are one of the chosens to be unhappy . And ultimately its this that traps u there  , until when u realize it isnt all about happiness but about having a path worth living , a path of your own .until are at peace with yourself u will be traped there .. All u can do is just in my opinion is just be there for her make her forget,  do stuff ,  make her arrive late at night in bed so that  shes tired ... Cause thats many time in those moments when u are talking by yourself that the real agony is . The forgetting fells so good , makes u feel alive . But each case is a case , and to each person and problem there may be a diferrent way to pull trough .and medicine  dont cure , they are like band aids to the problem but they let u have a emotional stability to maybe help u pull trough

"You can't just pull someone through depression. that's not how it works. It's a chemical imbalance in their brain that causes them to irrationally feel sad and depressed. This misconception is one of the most damaging to people suffering with the condition.

I have suffered with what I consider mild depression for years. I go untreated because frankly the antidepressants seem very risky to me, but it is still an enormous pain in the ass.

You wake up in the morning and don't see any reason to get out of bed. Who cares if you're late to work/school? nobody would miss you if you didn't show up. You have to will yourself up because you know it's not true and people would be pissed if you didn't show etc...

It's really hard to have solid relationships because you feel sad all the time about stupid things like your appearance not being perfect or if you say something dumb or you'll think people hate you because they didn't return a call immediately or other stupid crap that is completely irrational.

Sometimes you sort of lose control of your emotions where things just feel awful. When I was 19 I got dumped by my girlfriend of 3 years that I was head over heels for. I stopped talking to everyone and just became a recluse, not leaving my apartment for over a week before my parents showed up and banged on my door until I let them in. They drove the 4 hours up when they found out. (FYI people who are friends to depressed people it does help when you show a bit of compassion even if it is annoying and a pain)

Any negative event just gets multiplied by 1000 because you lose the ability to see what is reasonable unless you really focus or have someone to talk to about it. 

So if you want to help your partner with their depression just be there to talk to and be mindful of any needlessly cruel things you say or do. "
Randomly crying and being overwhelmed with feelings of uncontrollable sadness for no apparent reason.
"I suffered (and am in treatment for) major depression.  I was so shut down emotionally that when my Dad died it barely registered.  My wife eventually left me because she couldn't handle being around me.  I sort of understand because depressed people do suck to be around, but still.  

Anyway, the more important question is what you can do to help your SO.  Here's some stuff that would have helped me and might have saved my marriage:

(1) Taking the initiative and scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist for me.  When you are depressed even simple stuff like making an appointment can seem overwhelming.  Obviously you talk with her first rather than just springing it on her.  And take her to the appointment if you can - it's too easy to just sit like a lump and let these things pass by.

(2) Helping me get some exercise.  Exercise plus SSRIs plus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is what eventually pulled me out of the pit I was in.  Even just taking a regular long walk together would help.

(3) Run interference with other people who might be making demands on me.  When you are depressed even simple tasks are hard, so anything that lightens the load helps free up limited mental and emotional resources to fight the disease.

One other thing:  pay attention to her mood.  If she suddenly gets happy, watch her like a hawk.  Getting shot of depression is a slow process.  Sometimes when a depressed person resolves to go forward with committing suicide the sudden realization that all their problems will be over soon is enough to lift the immediate sense of gloom and leave them happy and relieved.

Good luck.  I know being partnered with a depressed person is a dozen kinds of shitty every day.  It sounds to me like you are doing the right thing by reaching out for insight and support so you can be there for her in appropriate ways."
"When I was in the midst of it, generally a lack of hope. I couldn't enjoy a nice sunny day because it seemed somehow sinister, and I think my perception of colors may have been altered? There was not just persistent sadness, there was a feeling that I would never again experience happiness and there was little point to being around. It helped for a time to become more physically active but because I was working a very toxic job and PTSD came into play, my efforts were overwhelmed which only fed it with feelings of failure and worthlessness, mixed up with symptoms of PTSD which amplified it and some of which seemed to taunt me. So, yay Lexapro! It helped the depression enormously, although the PTSD symptoms have needed additional work with EMDR. 

It's hard to explain in some ways but perceptions were altered, view of the world was altered, cognition was altered. "
"Genuinely thought I was dead for a year, and was convinced that this was hell or purgatory. Convinced myself that if my friend from the north visited and left, I was still alive. Friend was very confused when I was suddenly very chipper when talking to him on the phone when he had just spent a week hanging out with uber depressed me. Also lost my faith over that year. Got faith again now."
"I was in a terribly abusive relationship that left me in a crushing state of depression. I'm not sure if I have words for what it's like to be at the bottom of that barrel. Eventually I got out and started rebuilding. Now I'm married to a wonderful woman, and I can say it is like being a different person. When you're depressed I mean. "
"I would like to point out that it is important to watch the development of the person in question. A lot of people with depression can't judge realistically their condition. It comes very slowly and one day, you realize that it is not the case that ""everybody is sad sometimes"", but in reality you can't remember the last time you were happy. "
"The comic/blog from Hyperbole and A Half called Adventures in Depression does a pretty decent job of explaining it in such a way that people who haven't gone through depression can understand it.

Edit: words"
"I am currently very depressed and in a relationship with someone.

First things first. You cannot fix her or cure her. This is very frustrating because people tend to want to help and fix problems. My SO just wants to help me but can't. All you can really do is support them and be there for them when they need help with something. She helps me with things I cannot do, like making phone calls, scheduling things, cleaning my room, getting me up in the morning.

Try to understand that she can't just ""be positive"" or ""stop being depressed"" It is a real illness and while sometimes it will go away given enough time, it requires medication and/or therapy to improve the condition. Know that her feelings for you may vanish. People who are seriously depressed may have no romantic interest at all. They may be so consumed with trying not to want to kill themselves or be miserable all the time that they can't even think about a relationship.

It is very difficult to be in a relationship with someone who is seriously depressed as it can seem like they don't care about you, are always negative, and are draining to be around. I give you credit for hanging in there with her. Just try to do what you can to make her life easier. You can't fix the depression, but you can help her with things she struggles with."
"I think it's great that you're supportive of her. It really does mean a lot to someone who suffers. 

You'll need to learn the fine art of working out when things are too much, and when they need encouragement to do things. Sometimes, people with depression need a bit of a push to go out and do things, other times they physically cannot do anything. Be sure to communicate clearly with them so that you can both know what needs to be done ;)"
"I've had major depression. Try to find ways to distract her, find ways to get her to laugh, and don't try to convince her not to be depressed. For me when people tried to do that all it did was make me aggravated. Give it time overall and tell her you love her. /r/depression could help to. I haven't been there though, was depressed before I knew about Reddit. "
"I have depression, although I'm not sure which specific 'type'. I hope you don't mind me still answering the question though. Everything I'm sharing is only my *personal* experience; everyone is different. 

A lot of users have already shared what it feels like, so I won't talk too much about that. Here's my analogy, though: It feels like you're a gray, dirty, crumbling wall. Vandals spray vulgar words on you (your inner monologue of self-hatred), and there's no way to get rid of them. You're a wall, you're stuck – even if you *wanted* to get rid of the words (after all, depression saps all of your motivation to do anything, even the simplest or most usually-fun tasks), you can't move. You're so full of cracks that it feels like you're about to crumble apart. In fact, that would be much easier than straining to survive. 

You're asking about experiences, so here's my personal story. I'm in high school, and got diagnosed about a month ago. My parents started noticing my low mood around December, over winter break. I was failing – *did* fail – at least one class, with Ds in two others. Last semester, I got an incomplete in English, and am still making up the work (if I don't get at least a C, I won't be able to graduate high school). Before my parents knew I was depressed, they tried everything to get me to do my work. They took away summer activities, a school trip I had planned, would ban me from using my computer... Nothing worked. Nothing interested me. It didn't matter that I'd lose those privileges, because I'd probably just fail anyway, no matter what I did.

After winter break was over, my parents took my to see a psychiatrist. It was hard to be 100% honest with him, since I'm pretty private about my emotions, and he told me I had dysthymia. My parents and I didn't really agree with his diagnosis (like I said, I wasn't completely honest with him), but it was enough to get me medicated. I hated, and still hate, the idea of having to rely on pills for my happiness. They still haven't completely set in (I have more energy now, but I'm still unhappy), and at times it seems like the medication is pointless. I once forgot to take my medication, and was freaking out. When nothing happened for a few hours, I wondered why I was being medicated in the first place. I managed to get my medication before my mood could plummet, luckily. I've been on pills for a month.

I've also been going to therapy; I've only had four sessions so far. I'm going to be completely honest with you... I hate therapy. I dread it, and that's because I'm absolutely terrified of showing my vulnerability. I'm (irrationally) afraid of being judged, or pinned as insane (what if I'm 'crazier' than I thought?). It's really difficult, and I'd like to quit, but I'm sticking with it. 

In my experience, my best friend has been my biggest source of comfort. I find it best when she simply listens to me; I'd rather not be given advice. Even if talking to her is helpful, she still can't relate, and sometimes that feels very lonely. Just be there to support your SO.

"I'm going through an episode right now, actually.  Going on sites like Reddit and interacting is a way that I cope.  I feel like I'm on an upward spiral for now, so it's all good.  

With me, it's that I feel *nothing*.  I lose my ability to do anything that I normally love to do, and all I want to do is sleep and just sit in a dark room feeling nothing but wondering what it would feel like to bleed to death in a bathtub (I'm not suicidal, but I think about death a lot).  My motor functions even slow down, and problem solving at work becomes quite a chore.  Then, when it becomes overwhelming, I just sit and cry like a wild woman.  I'm not crying because I'm sad... it's just the only way I can feel anything of any kind.  

Whatever you do, DO NOT say things like ""Why not just choose to be happy?"" or ""You're so wonderful!  What do you have to feel sad about?""  People with depression can't just cheer up and choose to feel happy.  Just be there for her.  "
"I had it in late teens. Attempted suicide, wrist-cutting etc.  it's empty. You're empty. A void, an abyss inside of you that nothing can fill. So numb that your mother can be hugging you, crying, asking where her baby went, her little bright sunshine of a boy, and you stare over her shoulder, glassy-eyed and empty, simply waiting for her to let go so you can go back upstairs and continue to be empty.
You.just.want.to.die.  You build a wall, an immovable object, around yourself. No emotions in, no emotions out.  No one cares about you or understands how you feel, even if they say they care.  You have no motivation, no interest, no happiness, no reason to get up in the morning. Every day is empty or full of despair.

Depending on how bad off she is, you may not be able to reach her no matter how hard you try.  But try. Please try. Try as hard as you possibly can."
"Nothingness and then there are the gaps.  It's like I black out or something.  I was just looking at my bathroom and I had never thrown away new boxes for the soap.  I just let them stack up in the bathroom.  I didn't even notice them when I was experiencing a depressive episode  and I would never do that if I was feeling healthy. I could be in a burning house and not even notice when I'm depressed. I have gaps like that a lot.  I just wake up one day and realize that I've just let life roll by without even interacting with it.  Often it feels like there is a piece of dirty glass between me and life.  I can kind of see, hear, smell, but not really; there's a filter on life.  I know I don't make any sense. It sucks. "
"I have Manic Depression and in my experience, it's extremely debilitating. Normally, I am pretty cool about everything and get things done even if I'm having a bad day. Normal feelings are easy to work through. Fighting with friends? Ehh I'll sleep on it, I have things to do. But then the depression is triggered by something (or at times, seemingly nothing) and it's EXACTLY like a physical ailment. I get something similar to nausea, except I can't throw up. Food is disgusting, I can't eat. I have a hard time swallowing because my throat begins closing up. Someone walks up to me and cheerily asks me ""Hey, how are you?"" and all I can do is stare blankly because what answer could I possibly give. The world is spiraling downwards and there is nothing I can do. It's like people are looking at you through a window. They just don't understand. They'll never understand. They are trying to get you to go bowling when you feel so awful, even though you fear death just as much as everyone else, you wish you weren't alive. It is 100% a disease. I've suffered chronic migraines my entire life, dislocated my knee, and used to be a drug addict and was beaten up/jumped multiple times. I have felt pain and I would choose anything physical over depression. 
     As her SO, please try to understand that you cannot cure her depression. It exists outside of you. You will never find the kernel that causes it, no matter how much you try. The best/only thing you can do is let her know that you will love her and be there when she's at her worst. She needs to know that there is light in the dark. Imagine she is in jail. She can't get out, and bad things are happening inside. She has nothing to offer you and it makes her feel even more awful that her incarceration effects you negatively. Keep visiting her, even when she says not to. Keep calling her. Keep writing her letters. Someday she'll be free and you two can embrace, but until then, let her know you love her for who she is, and not what she does for you. It's true for anyone going through it. People need to know they don't have to be happy and perfect for you to love them. "
"I had chronic depression from 13 or so until I was 22. Once I was far more sorted and looking back on it all, the thing that struck me was how mundane it all is at the time. I knew a lot of it wasn't good, but it was just my life. Even when I stared into a snowstorm and thought about laying down in it to kill myself, it didn't seem weird. I didn't even think of it as contemplating suicide until someone asked me if I'd had suicidal thoughts.

Others have said this already, but professional help is a big step in the right direction. Especially if you can find someone who's great for you. I went to five different therapists until I found the right one. I've always had people who cared about me deeply, and were there for me. I know that having their love and support helped greatly because I didn't have to go through it alone, but seeing a therapist was one of the best things I ever did for myself. 

This is something that will never go away entirely. There will always be moments when she falls into the same patterns or thinks the same way. The best you can do is help her live and think in a way that minimizes the impact on her life, but she has to do the brunt of the work herself. Good luck, and godspeed."
"It's hard to get out of bed, that's a cliché but it's true. You feel debilitated, as in physically debilitated. It's like your mind is so grey and blunt and in your mind vision you just see a pitch of black. 
I have every reason to be depressed right now but thank god I have learned that exercise fights depression hard, so I exercise every day and it works.

"
"After middle school all my friends left the school. Starting high school was a huge change for me and I felt really alone. To top it off I had diagnosed disgraphia, ADD, as well as mild case Aspergers syndrome. Basically I broke down. I couldn't go to school I was crying practically everyday, it felt as physically debilitating as it was mental, there were times when I quite literally could not move. Eventually with the right medication and a fantastic psychiatrist I was able to recover. Depression is tough. I hope your SO can pull through it. "
"It's a mixture of fear, panic, hatred of others, and self-loathing. The tiniest little thing can set you spiraling into one of these categories.

My girlfriend and I recently got out of this funk after 3 months. All I could do was be as supportive and as positive as possible towards her. *She* has to want to get better as well. 

Be encouraging if she wants to do something. Thank her for things. Ask her for small favors. Don't be negative or sad back to her. Sadness is infectious just like happiness is.

"
"It's honestly hard to put into words. It didn't happen all at once and was kind of a downward spiral into nothing. It starts out as sadness and just goes on to become a constant nothing. It's hard to feel anything but hatred towards yourself. At my worst my grandfather had died and I just didn't feel anything although we were extremely close. As far as suicidal thoughts go you I never thought I would even consider. As the days went on I started weighing the pros and cons of it. I still didn't really want to die, but it just became an option. After a while I had considered it heavily and was on the verge of ending my life so I decided to see a psychiatrist. Things are better now, but they're still hard sometimes. To anyone going through depression of any form, get help immediately from a professional. It's not something that gets better on it's own."

"I had what was diagnosed as a Major Depressive Episode when my sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer. With the family going through a lot anyway, the only person who knew was my SO. Each day I would fake being normal and trying to support my family, and each night I would be so exhausted at the effort of it all I would just pass out. A few months after she died I was made redundant from my job and I pretty much had a breakdown as it all hit me at once. I lost the ability and energy to fake being normal anymore. I just couldn't cope. I still didn't tell my family though, as they were trying to deal with their grief. 

It's a few years on and I'm still struggling, although I can at least fake it now. It still exhausts me and every so often I just cannot get out of bed, and I phone into work with a stomach bug or migraine as I wouldn't trust them to understand a mental illness. It helps really that I HAVE to get up on most days, there is no choice, so I get up and pretend. I think those that I work with would be surprised if they knew. 

I'm not suicidal, but I'd be pretty pleased not to exist and go through this day after day. "
"Im not sure if mine is severe but its getting up in the morning and hating everything, begin driving to school and just pulling over and sitting there for 30 minutes before turning around and going back to bed."
"If I quit taking my Prozac, I become suicidal in about 48 hours.  By ""suicidal"" I mean I start thinking about how to commit suicide.  I realize what is happening, i.e., that I do not actually want to die, but I cannot voluntarily stop thinking about suicide and why I am worthless.  From time to time my pharmacy changes the brand of generic Prozac that it dispenses; some of them do not work.  How do I know?  I start thinking about suicide.  The common notion that a depressed person can choose not to be depressed is completely mistaken, and in a relationship situation it is toxic.  Depression is a biochemically-caused condition, and the victim can no more cure himself by will power alone than can a person who has a disease such as cancer or pneumonia."
I go through varying waves of depression every so often. If I'm just feeling down i drink a little too much a little to often and try to numb myself up to the world. If it gets really bad then I'll come home from work and get into bed and go to sleep because being awake and conscious seems like too much of a burden. I end up becoming a shut in for a couple weeks. Just work and sleep and work and sleep. 
"The best way I can describe it is like constantly wearing a very, very heavy coat with a mind of its own. 

Think about it. Think about depression like a very heavy coat, and its only objective is to bring you down to the ground. You don't know how it got on you in the first place. You don't know why it feels so heavy. You don't even realize at first it's there. But it's *heavy as hell*. It confines your movements. It weighs down on your shoulders. You know you can unbutton it, remove it, you know it's not right for you to wear the coat all the time, but it's so damn heavy that the effort to raise your hand and unbutton it is incredible. 

The coat only lets you move as far as it wants to let you move, and the collar is up so high that you hear and see only what it wants you to see and hear. 

And most people don't understand it. They can ask you, ""Have you tried taking it off?"" ""Can you not wear the coat?"" ""You're not accomplishing anything while in this coat!"" - they wouldn't know, unless they wore it for themselves. 

Eventually your body adapts to the coat, to its weight, to its confinement, and whatever you know or remember of life without the coat retreats into the back of your mind. Getting up is an effort, but it's a familiar effort. You know that the coat is on you. You know that it's possible to remove it, but either the weight of the coat sapped your strength, or you just adapt and accept it as par for the course. 

That's what the coat wants. And it can get heavier, confining you even more, and obscuring your vision until you just can't see past the coat collar. And you know, at that moment, that it can bring you to where you won't be able to get up again.

But when you do muster the power to unbutton even one button on that coat, removing it becomes easier. When you finally battle through removing it, you fling it into a corner, but it never goes away. It's always there, in a pile. You may forget about its presence, but your body remembers its weight, its confinement; your mind always remembers not being able to see past it. And you always keep wondering if one day you'll find it on you again. 

 
From personal experience with the coat, as I put it, I felt...numb. Most of the time, it's not so much as what I felt, as what I didn't. I would get so frustrated with the fact that apart from just an empty blank space, I didn't really feel very much. It took a long time to fight through, and an even longer time to feel happy in any iteration. 

The best thing you can do is be there for her. Hug her and tell her it's okay. If she wants to be in bed for a day, that is fine - stay by her. Listen to her when she talks to you about what she feels. Professional help is very important, but what's also important is support from the people closest to her - and that makes a huge difference in pulling through it."
"For me, I would go to bed wishing my heart would stop, and wake up disappointed to still be alive. Every single morning I would think ""how the hell am I going to talk to people, smile at people, pretend to be okay?"" Life was exhausting.

One way I tried to describe it to someone once: it's like your mind is an open field, and you're standing there, and all of a sudden you can feel the rain coming. There's this black cloud building up in your head and you try to stop it, because it's your mind, right? You should be able to stop things from happening in your brain if you want to, right?. But you can't - that cloud builds up and builds up no matter how hard you fight, and eventually it bursts into a storm, and once the storm starts you're just useless for a while. It literally did feel like a storm in my head - like a tornado, really. The inside of my mind was all dark and thoughts were spinning around at 150 mph and I had no control over it. It was scary as fuck and exhausting and that's really why I was suicidal - being inside my brain sucked so bad I didn't want to keep going anymore."
For me it is having daily thoughts of hanging myself but knowing that would hurt my SO too much to actually complete suicide. It also means seeing a psychiatrist for over a year but still searching for the right meds (they are now adding a low dose of abilify to my wellbutrin and trintellix.  It also means feeling like a failure because my job is being a youth and family therapist and I can't even get through my own depression. It's been 2 years now and I am just so tired of this shit.
"In my case it was awful. It cropped up twice. The first instance was a year and a half of fatigue, emptiness, and feeling absolutely useless. The second was just a month ago and I've only recently felt better (if you don't count any of this week). I screwed up though, I didn't let my SO know and now he's pulling away. My advice? Let her know you're there. You can never truly understand how she feels, but you can be there for her. It's dark, empty, and draining; however having someone there for me was comforting. Does she laugh when you make a fart noise? Make the damn fart noise. Laughing is light, you forget (even if just for a second) that you're down. When you sleep, hold her tight. Make sure she knows you won't let go. She will pull through, just say strong."
"I've had it my whole life (hereditary). I mean, it sucks but once you've found the right medication regimen --- and yes, trial and error can be a part of it --- it's not so bad. 

On top of everything else I lost my job and have been out of work, which has added more specific depression. However, in addition to my medication my ailment has also given me years of therapy which has equipped me to deal with it in a healthy manner.

**tl;dr** It sucks, but finding the right medication and therapy regimen can help you cope not only with the disorder, but also with other things that may go wrong in your life.



**EDIT**: Oh, but to answer your question, there's a sense of emptiness and boredom. Like, ""So I get up tomorrow and do shit and then go back to bed. And then I have to get up and do the same thing, day after day for the rest of my life? Am I just waiting out the clock?"". "
I read several of the comments regarding a lack of interest or meaning in life.  All of this is true.  Consider a life where everything is gray and there is nothing colorful.  your favorite food is ash in your mouth.  There's a bleak hopelessness that's pervasive in everything you do.  You're lonely even when around your closest friends.  Don't mistake it for sadness.  I can still chuckle at something humorous.  
"It's when you are sad every single second, without perspective and intrusive thoughts.

It will drain your life day by day, every new one will be worse if you let that happen. 

She needs professional help and build some self esteem, discipline and healthy habits. 

ps: Exercise helps alot, you should support her, it is a hell if you feel no one is supporting you. "
"Someone can be saying irrelevant things like ""Hi, how's your day?"" and you feel tears coming and you wonder why you stepped out of the house.
You dislike people and get them to stay away because you don't want people to see you.
Everything's wrong and jumping out seems not really that scary.

There's really nothing you can do. Hug her maybe. Nothing much else."
"Had a 2ish year phase where I was really bad, I worked as a bartender, loved my job/co workers, but little did they know that unless I was working, I was home playing WoW like a religion, drinking all the time..good days it was just beer, bad days I'd be killing bottles of jack or whatever I was having at the time.

Feeling lonely, worthless, crying myself to sleep on a nightly basis, a big reason was I fucked up a good long term relationship and didn't realize the gravity of my mistake til I moved to the other side of the country a couple months later.

3 suicide attempts..almost made it on my 3rd..russian roulette with a bunch of random pills and woke up in the E.R a few hours later.

I can go on but I'm not about to write a detailed novel."

"Show her that you care. Depression can affect each person in different ways but it makes one feel very lonely and worthless. You feel detached from the world , hence the feeling ""everything would be better of without me"" which is very common for everyone who suffers from it. 
As some people have said above, if she's in a very deep depressive state then you probably won't be able to offer much help, but be there. Show her that she's not alone , she's not a failure , that she's important for you . 
It's a very personal problem so in the end of the day she will have to be the one to deal with it on her own - but it's a lonely road so if you can just be there to make her feel loved and cared for then it might make things better. "
"Honestly, depending on what she is going through, there may not BE a ""pull through"". Up front I have to say, if it is real depression (major or minor) she should seek professional help.

With that out of the way, I can say a few things that you should know. First, let her know in clear and certain terms that you are there for her and can help her, and listen to her. A lot of stress can be relieved just by having someone to talk to, to share an emotional burden or feelings or other shit. 
Second, depending on whether this is a life-long thing or a brief episode, cognitive behavioral therapy helps, and is something you can do without a professional (though it helps to have a therapist). This means, if there are certain ways of thinking or thoughts that she has that are detrimental/defeatist/depressing, she acknowledges them when they happen, and mentally refutes them. It is a bit more in depth than that, but look it up, it can change a person's thinking.
Third, TELL HER TO SEEK THERAPY. There is no shame in going to a doctor when you are sick, and there shouldn't be any when going to a therapist for mental illness. Having a detached third party to talk about your problems with is very beneficial, even if she will talk to you about her problems. Another advantage is that it makes it that much easier to get a prescription if it is deemed necessary, or something that she wants to try.
Fourth, push her to do things. With depression, it becomes very easy to close yourself off and not want to do things, even things you would normally want to do, and sometimes she will need to be dragged into doing things. Going out, being social, doing fun activities, these can all help with depression, BUT, it can be difficult to discern when a push is needed or when it should not be attempted, and could actually be counter-productive.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a doctor or licensed therapist, I just know about my own situation and what helped me, from living my entire life with dysthimia, and having a two year period of major depressive disorder, and am now on medication and going to therapy, managing my mental health. "
"IMO, you can't TRULY understand it unless you experience it firsthand.  But I'll try to explain.

You feel surrounded by grey, by bleakness, a despair that almost has weight.  The world seems to love kicking you down; things are always going wrong.  You feel like the scum of the earth, no matter how many times people tell you you're wonderful.  You can only focus on all the bad things that have happened in your life, on the mistakes you've made.  You begin to see yourself as a burden, a shame to society, and you believe the world would be better off without you. Some days, you feel catatonic, and you aren't sure you're even alive anymore.  You have lost all hope and believe you're doomed to be unhappy and alienated forever.

But there IS hope.  Today, I am happy, smiling, looking towards the future.  I still feel really bitter about things sometimes, but I've let go of a lot of things I'd thought would fester inside me forever.  I believe your SO can recover.  Sometimes, depressed or not, we feel like we've sunk so deep into despair there is no way out.  But there is ALWAYS hope."
"Finding an answer is the best thing you can do. Through all the meaningless chaos and apathy in the world, the only respite a person can get is finding an answer that fits them. Allowing yourself to let out emotions can be a way....

Honestly, many people are digging themselves a deeper hole in the split moment where you want to commit suicide. Best thing to do is to tell your SO to sleep on it. Depression can come with stress or lack of sleep as well.

The saddest song I've heard.....

">  I question sometimes (rationally) the point in living.

I feel this. My only real family is my parents, and really only my mom. I have no siblings. I'm nearly 34 and have no real expectation of ever having a girlfriend or wife. Kids are even more laughable. 

I have no interest in going back to school, I have a dead end job, a house and two dogs. The dogs are really the reason I keep going. "
"its a sad reality, but life sucks, it fucks you sideways, and then you die and none of it really ever mattered. you live to die basically, its sucks that this is what civilization has come to"
Your experience is similar to mine. I think the most interesting thing about it (for me- I cant say this applies to you or anyone else of course) is that when I'm okay I still know that life is ultimately 'pointless' but it just doesn't bother me. Its interesting how the objective facts don't change but the way we feel about them does.
"This description actually sounds like Major Depressive Disorder. 

Manic depression, which you mention in your post is something different. 

You may want to consider therapy and/or pharmacological treatments."
It doesn't matter that nothing matters. You don't need to change the world to live a meaningful life. 
"I feel like you are also being reinforced by the mild high you can get from starving yourself.  At least that's how I feel.  Soon after I eat, I get the energy to 'think' and in turn have a multitude of negative thoughts. "
"That's me about once every other week, rather just sleep for an  eternity that do anything. "
"When I stopped taking my medication I tried eating food, but my mouth was completely dry. It's almost as if my body didn't want me to eat, or do anything.. When you're depressed you lose the will to do anything."

holy shit. thank you for sharing this video. it hits hard
"Oh my god, I can't believe how dead-on that *cartoon* was! Seriously word for word, everything that was stated/illustrated... I couldn't have said it better myself. I'm so glad you shared that."
"Im sorry you had to go through that. I don't know your case or your ex boyfriend, but I was somebody who dumped their girlfriend in the middle of her depression. For a long time I felt bad, I felt selfish. But I thought about it one day. For a year and a half I tried it all to fix her because she wasn't trying to fix herself. I tried being positive and giving her what she wanted, I tried forcing her out of bed and to school, I cried, I got angry, I screamed, I called doctors, I cried more and tried her to get into a mentally and physically healthier lifestyle. I even started to write her a book about how to deal with it, and how I felt - although I had no idea how to deal with it myself. One day I finally had enough, I broke it off with her for good (after many fights and semi break ups). I felt my happiness had dissappearred and I wasn't who I was anymore. Sometimes that's just the way people have to deal with things. "
Good for you the way people treated you after you were hospitalized was fucked up but I'm glad you made it through.
"I remember the real darkest depths of what I had, how actively horrible it was.

But what I have now, that chronic, moderate depression, is just as insidious. It's just like what you say. Maybe I don't wanna die, but life is just so hard, even if objectively it's not. You just deal and deal and deal, draining you away,  but you remember, maybe, at some point that it never used to be so hard just to live. That there's another feeling out there, one that actually feels good, that you used to feel more often than once a couple of months.

Onward to therapy and meds and the acknowledgement of hope that, even if I don't feel it in my heart, that I know it can be done."
I know bro stay strong ;) 
That quote is one of the best succinct descriptions I've seen so far; nice.
"It's the feeling (kind of true). That the entire fabric of our society and culture and social norms are built to the advantage of people who AREN'T depressed.  The world rewards outgoing, motivated, confident, driven,  emotionally in-control people.

It's horrible to basically have just been stuck with faulty wiring that basically makes you the OPPOSITE of what's required to mesh with the world, and it absolutely feels like a cosmic joke."
"You are so strong to have made it, even if it continues to be hard. 

I know that may sound hollow over the internet, maybe won't mean anything to you, but I'm someone who has suffered from depression and by nature of my particular illness will continue to do so periodically for the rest of my life. I mean it as more than an empty platitude.

Wishing the best to you and to all of us in this thread."

"Its more that supportive people must not take it as a fault of their selves if you have depression.  And this kind of narcissism is dangerous to friendship and life - it will ruin relationships and increase the volatility of the one suffering.  

you need to remember they are experiencing depression every second of their lives - in physical, emotional, and mental anguish.  They feel their past, present, and future are hopeless to a great extent.  

It is wonderful that you are compassionate and empathic enough to want to help.  that is very rare.  But you must remember this is not about you, it is about the individual who believes they are broken and not compatible with their life.  Things will be said with generalization and imperfect wording, do not try to hold them to this or use the ""But I didn't do that, did I,"" deflection because that just NULLIFIES their feelings and thoughts.  This nullification of their mental process is a defacto nullification of their entire selves.  And that is dangerous.  You are telling a depressed person that their thoughts and feelings are invalid and wrong.  if they are in a dangerous place, they may just snap."

Animals, gardening, woodworking, any form of creating....all pretty satisfying in my experience."
"Yeah, one thing that stuck with me was in a Ken Burns film about Lewis & Clark, where Meriwether Lewis on his birthday was all depressed and questioning if he had done enough to change the world.  He was younger than I am now.  Pretty sure he shot himself...."
"That just means that its common to feel this way, not that anyone/everyone who shares this feeling will be able to make a change."
"On a large enough scale, *nothing* matters. You could annihilate the entire planet, and sure, it would suck for the planet, but the galaxy wouldn't even notice. But that doesn't mean that nothing matters at all. It all does matter, at smaller scales. And that's okay. It means it's actually more important to do what matters to you, rather than worry about doing something that matters to the world. If you derive satisfaction from doing something with wider impact, by all means, shoot for that, but don't feel like your life is pointless just because it might not change the whole world; no matter what, it does change your own bit of the world."
"Mmm.  There are times where I won't sleep for days, because my brain won't stop tearing itself apart until there literally isn't enough energy left for it to remain operational."
Maybe just lazy. I feel the same and I'm not depressed
"You're welcome. Although I'm always torn... Glad the video is relatable, but sad that somebody else feels in such a way that they can also relate to it. :/"
"I can understand where you're coming from. In regards to my ex-boyfriend, he was my world and he knew it. We'd been together for about four years and he knew I had issues with depression, but I was pretty persistent to not dump my issues on him. I relied on him at first (when our relationship was young) but after, as you describe, fights and semi-breakups I realised what stress I was putting on him, particularly because his brother was fighting cancer. I really closed up emotionally to try and make his life easier. 

I have no hard feelings against him, just like I understand why you ended things, I can understand why he ended things. However, the way he did it was poor. He visited the hospital every day and night for the first few days and then one day he didn't turn up. Instead, my best friend turned up and explained that he wasn't coming because he wanted to breakup. Honestly, I have never felt so heartbroken. 

It was a good life lesson though and time is a great healer. He's in a relationship with another girl and is happy. I'm married and happy. I know he regrets what he did though, I can see it in his eyes whenever we bump into each other, however, I'm glad I saw his true colours before we got even more serious; as blunt as this sounds, I dodged a bullet."
Love you.
Same here! It really makes me feel. Glad you liked it. 
"That’s it exactly, its wiring.  Or chemistry.  I see absolutely no difference between depression and, say, diabetes.   It’s chemistry.  I’ve never been ashamed of my depression, in fact, I never knew I was depressed, I thought everyone thought about suicide, I thought it was a normal part of life.    Turns out its just a normal part of MY life. "
"Thanks for the kind words; they do mean something, even coming from a complete stranger. In an odd way it's almost calming reading others' personal experiences in this post."

Yes it means that they can take you into custody for fear that you are a danger to yourself or others.
"I can believe that, it is a very delicate point and experience. I was denied a psychologist as they thought medications and learning new routines would help me, something it did. Hope you are well now though."
"I've seen three therapists now, that have all tried pushing anti depressants on me. I'm really uncomfortable with it, because they're just throwing drug names out there willy nilly.

That and I really don't want to have to depend on pills."
"omg STRONGLY AGREE. Mine listened to me talk for like 25 minutes, obviously bored, and then started asking me instantly about SSRIs as if hoping to shut me up"

my parents do not understand at all. I'm not sure if this will help but I am going to share it with them in hopes that it will help a little. I'm getting help so don't feel sad! been on antidepressants for a while but just started therapy
Im sorry he done it that way. That's pretty crappy. I'm glad you're both doing better now though. Just wanted to share my story because I was on the other side once.
The difference is people don't expect you to be able to just stop being diabetic.
Oh I see. Thank you for clearing that up 
"if one is suicidal or even in the neighborhood they should go and see professional help assuredly.  I was dealing with counselors and pharmacologists who were obsessed with 1-10 rankings, pills, and convincing me that my concerns were not really that troubling.   That it was all through my employer's health and employee care programs did not help.  And yes, that company did lay me off as soon as they could shuffle my body around enough to do it legally."
"Sorry, I wrote to a generic reader who is trying to support someone who is suffering.  I deal every minute of every day with my specters as well, I didn't mean to cause trouble.  

I just wanted to help those that want to help understand something. As depression is such a personal and varied affliction I tried to relate in as generalized a manner as possible.  you know, to take the ego out of it.   

I know I have lost people and relationships because they took my depression personally.  It seemed they got angry with me that they were not the miracle worker.  And then I felt guilt for making them angry. And that really angered me (with my self and the other) and set me further back from society.  Further from even wanting to want to be in society.  

I just build what I can myself, within or around myself.  Do a little thing every day that makes my immediate world better.  just a walk, clean something for a minute (even if its just putting crap in boxes), etc.  - then letting it make me feel less bad when I see it next. Then let it snowball the next day.  "
"I do have plans.  I just realize that in a few hundred years, my life won't matter no matter how much I try to be great.  Unless of course you consider the butterfly effect.....we all influence one another, and we change the future.  How though?  And will my stepping on a butterfly negate the extinction of a species....or will the greedy assholes in power just nuke us all?  I call it being a realist."
"True.  But thankfully, I’ve never been told to ‘snap out of it’ or ‘just get over it’ "
[deleted]
"That's not being a realist. That's having delusions of grandeur, as if being remembered in a hundred years is the only thing that could give your life meaning. Your life is not pointless just because you didn't change the entire world. "
"It's usually not that blunt, but it tends to come down to the notion that you can just reason it away."
"true, just not a balanced catch-22.  If that makes sense, heh."

Deep physical pain. Feeling absolutely certain that nobody likes me and they wouldn’t care if I was gone. Wanting to quit my job and leave my life behind.
"numb, kinda. like everything is overwhelming to me, so i just kinda give up, wallowing in my misery thats usually of my own design"
"Before I was medicated it wasn’t depression . Depression is sadness but with me it was beyond that. It was absolute torture ! Like my brain is fried. I can’t even describe it . 1 minute felt like an hour ! 
Thank you god for medicine 
🧿🧿🧿Knockwood I’m much better now 🧿🧿🧿"
"Guilty. I don't know why I feel guilty, it's not like I feel guilty because I feel depressed and nothing is causing it. I've heard people feel guilty for that sort of reason, like other people have it worse, so why do they feel this way? That's not the case for me. Guilt for no reason, it's almost physically painful. It's like I ate a brick and it's stuck in my chest. Like I did something so awful, so terrible, so inhumane, and I feel guilty for it. Except, I didn't do anything. Sometimes it just eats me alive. It is such a dreadful feeling, I don't think I have words to describe how painful it is. This is when I'm genuinely sad and depressed. I can be depressed and not necessarily sad, but feeling this? It's like a constant state of devastation. One small thing could send me over the edge, and I'm in tears. You'd think someone must have died, or I had been told the worst news, life altering news. But I just knocked over a cup. It's a suffocating feeling. 

Or I'm empty. What little personality I had before is dead. What few things I enjoyed before are boring. Tedious. Irritating. Everything is a chore. All I want to do is sleep. When I can't sleep anymore, I'll stare at the ceiling. I can't eat. I can't shower. I can't find the motivation to do the dishes, to do laundry, to do grocery shopping. This causes some guilt. I'm not holding up my end of the deal with my partner, I'm lagging behind while trying to keep the house together. This creates more work for him, while I just lay there and rot. I dread waking up the next day because the feeling is never-ending. Like all of the sparks, all the light and imagination and joy I used to feel has been sucked out of me. My brain feels like it's rotting. I can't focus, I can't retain information. I could be told to remember one thing to do one day, I'd forget about it in a matter of minutes. What would normally takes me seconds to read, now takes me minutes. I forgot what I had just read, I have to go back and start over and over and over. I can't process the words I'm reading. I genuinely feel stupid when I'm depressed. It's like my brain is a shitty dial-up computer. 

All of it causes negative thoughts. What's the point? Why does my husband put up with this? Why does anyone put up with me? Everyone is going to get tired of me. I can't do anything right. I'm a terrible person. What terrible thing did I do to deserve to feel this way?"
"I’m in a bad depression right now, and today is the first day I could get myself out of bed. I showered yay! For me, I’m immobile. I could lay there for hours doing nothing but trying to quiet the things in my head. This time, I’m full of anger (triggering event has made me incredibly angry). But regardless of the trigger, I usually have some level of rage, but I’m almost catatonic in a sense. I’m very paranoid as well, and won’t answer any calls or texts."
It seems to be different every time for me. Sometimes I dont feel anything at all and I feel like I'm suffocating. Other times I get intrusive thoughts every 5 seconds for several weeks. Sometimes I get in a cycle where I wake up depressed and spend the last time of my day hypomanic
"Constant despair and rumination about negative things, always tired, poor sleep, physical aches and pains, physically slowed down, can't enjoy anything or see the good in anything"
Depression feels like to me like a dementor sucking my soul and feelings slowly till I’m crippled to the bed and under a blanket with not wanting to do nothing and mostly don’t want nothing to do with the outside world that I want curtains closed just darkness and my thoughts
"Feels gray, like I cannot feel feelings, days fly by and are all the same."
"The world is grey, the future is so, so bleak. Nothing can break through it. I can’t enjoy anything and when I wake up in the am, my first thought is crap, another day to get thru. Physically, I feel a dark empty hole where my heart should be. I cry a lot but if the depression gets worse, I can’t even cry. I’ve lost weight when depressed bc my appetite disappears. Sometimes there are feelings like I’m a fuck up. I don’t like myself. It’s hideous."
i feel like im just taking up space in the world
My depression is really low energy levels. So low that I'm getting irritated at every single thing I have to do because it's so much damn effort. Also anxiety that bad things are going to happen and anxiety about the way I think people see me (negatively) also Negative self-image and defensiveness.
"I feel like I'm not normal like other people, I don't see a future, I'm anxious, and when I get really down the suicidal thoughts kick in. When it gets really really bad, I'm nothing. I don't move, I just sit and stare. I can't move or talk, with not a thought going on in my head.

I always manage to climb out of it though. I'm lucky I have supportive friends and family, a good partner and a pretty decent job - but those things almost cease to exist in my mind when I go down the dark hole."
"I feel no emotions other than hopelessness and irritation when I'm depressed. I never have any energy and it's an extreme effort to try to act friendly, but I manage for short periods. Isolating doesn't help but I have to force myself not to."
"deep pit in my stomach, cant leave my bed, constant self-loathing, not eating/ being hygienic, crying a lot, very textbook shit"
Feels like a weight on me pulling me down. All I do is cry and I just can’t get out of bed. Very draining and mostly dark thoughts.
"So sad it feels like I’m physically sick- like days on end of just being tired, fatigued, sad then I just go home and cry for an hour or so and almost throwing up bc of it; it feels like my body is physically breaking- when it’s really bad I have suicidal thoughts that I know are just the chemicals talking so I’ve learned to ignore them; gladly I haven’t felt like this in almost a year since I’m on medication"
"The best way I can describe my depression is the inability to feel ""good"" feelings. Satisfaction, joy, pleasure, excitement... they are either dumbed down or completely nonexistent. Doing things that should feel good do not. I put on nice clothes but still feel ugly. I make my favorite food but don't feel satisfied afterwards. I stare at a blank canvas with no drive to paint anything. I force myself to smile when my friends make jokes. I try listening to my favorite songs but just turn them off halfway because it doesn't sound like it used to. 

This makes everything feel numb, as if going through the motions. Until it gets so bad I can't even do the basic things like get out of bed, brush my teeth, reply to people, because it doesn't feel good to do them. I do worse in school, I call out of work, I cancel plans with friends. I'll either stop eating or eat so much as a a desperate attempt to feel. 

And then there's that feeling deep in my gut. I have no way to describe it except pain. A pain that feels like there's a massive hand that's ripped something from inside of me, and left my abdomen empty and my body frozen curled up in a ball on the floor or in my bed. And the worst part of it is convincing myself that I feel that pain for a reason. Like it's my punishment because I fcked up and lost my job and failed my classes and cut off my friends, because the ""truth"" is that I'm a horrible person, who doesn't deserve to feel good. I feel guilty, alone, empty, and lost. 

Eventually it makes me feel so incredibly desperate for the pain to stop, and that's when I finally develop the motivation to do something - anything. Sometimes it means driving myself to the ER, writing a goodbye letter, or indulging in some self destructive behavior."
"It fluctuates for me. Sometimes it is a very profound susceptibility to sadness. Most times it's a profound weight, like the future doesn't seem worthwhile to me and I just want to hide and lie in bed all day but I know I can't because I'd be homeless which also is not an ideal state so I'm left in this constant limbo."
"Apathy with a little sprinkle of deep deep physically felt anguish, ya know for a little ✨pizazz✨"
"When I sink low enough it doesn't just effect my current mood, it sucks the joy from my past as well. Like, even if I can remember being stable it doesn't feel real and I become convinced I was just delusional, not stable or happy. It sucks the joy from literally everything and I can't even look back and say ""I was happy/stable before and I'll be that way again eventually."" Of course when it does finally end that feeling goes away but every time it comes back it feels like I will always be that way and always have been."
its a physical hurt that paralyzes me at times and seeps into my mind and all of the pain makes me feel sick like im slowly dying.
Drowning
"Aggravation, irritation, no energy, headache, dumb, no desire, frustration, slow, fog, pain"
"That rings true for me, it's like being a different mind where there's no hope for the future, no desire to have curtains open or see the light of day it's just too bright and everything hurts.  NO energy to little to none.  

Legs feel heavy, moving feels difficult and I just want to stay curled up in bed.  Sometimes I have pain on my face but that could just be poorly timed infections.

Angry, more anger and irritability of please just leave me alone. Isolation.  Not really eating, unless delivery possibly.  Messy area, more so than usual. 

Disorganized thinking and processing time slower.

Thoughts of I have to end it, then when I get out of the episode I forget I had those thoughts to begin with, a new brain it feels like.  

It's a very surreal feeling."
"To me it feels like almost constant suicidal ideation. Thinking about how I don’t want to grow old feeling like this. I’d rather die “young “ at 38 than be miserable for no reason for the rest of my life. I have a loving spouse, family, friends, physically fairly healthy. Not able to be as active as I’d like leisurely due to a car accident 8 years ago, which probably has a lot to do with my relapse into despair."
The best way I would describe my state of depression is me drowning in a huge pool. I always felt like I was drowning and when I started taking antidepressants and going into therapy I finally felt like my head was above the water.
Wow! Thanks for replying - it helps!
"For me, it's a kind of intense, bone-deep boredom. Nothing makes me happy (even things I normally love), so I don't do anything. Even when I'm not actively feeling sad, though that's usually the case when I'm in a down phase, it's like I'm just incapable of feeling happiness, like that whole emotional range has been cut out. And that makes the perfect opening for hopelessness and self-hate to muscle in and make themselves known."
I feel nothing. When I’m deeply depressed I’m just super apathetic and feel kind of like a robot. It’s absolute hell
"The ""everybody hates me"" thoughts hide in the back of my mind. It's like I don't even realize I'm thinking it."
Me too. I feel empty and out of place. My existing makes me uncomfortable in my own home. Like I should not be here.
[removed]
"I feel quite similar to this description. I am beginning to believe it’s over medication? I have slowly decreased a couple meds and I am able to do a little more. But the weight I have gained as a side effects is also depressing. I have reasons to be depressed ( no job, moved home at 53) but still the guilt from life lost due to this illness& meds is overwhelming. 

I hope you feel better eventually."
And then it lifts? And you are back?
Today was a big day! I am with you!
The anxiety! I absolutely feel the same the anxiety that bad things will happen…
"It’s so weird that when we are in the black hole we completely forget about the good things we have - family, friends, job, even things like watching the sunset don’t matter anymore. very weird"
Does it always come to an end?
and does it end?
"Wow, thanks!!!!!!!"
What state are you in right now? Does the future look more promising?
Oh wow! Thanks for replying! I do feel the same it’s like my past happy years it was not really me somehow and I am having a hard time imagining that depression will come to an end… like how will this end happen? how is it possible?
“Then when I get out of the episode I forget I  had those thoughts” loved it

I'm hoping the same for you. <3
"Eventually yes. The period of time this lasts varies a lot. A week, a month, several months. Sometimes if it's months, I'll get a few decent days here and there, and then it's back like it was before. Other times it's consistent throughout those months. Thankfully I'm not experiencing this now, and hopefully it'll be a while before it happens again."
"Sometimes I don't notice I'm getting depressed until the anxiety hits me. And I'm like ""oh shit"""
Yep - and it only takes a small moment of forgetting to do something stupid. That's why I always make sure to talk to my loved ones about my bipolar and when I'm feeling down. It helps them to also notice any changes and to know when I might need friend.
Well I'm still here! So it must do 😊
Sadly no. It comes and goes. As fucked up as it sounds sometimes I wish I can stay manic but I don’t even like myself when I’m manic at times. Just the dark thoughts consume you so much that at times I felt like I became it and I wanted feel nothing.
"Right now a bit of sadness and a lot of wanting to hide and do nothing. The future doesn't seem very promising to me right now. I don't look forward to it. I'm not suicidal though. I want to live. But I don't like where I'm at in life, and I don't like where it's heading. I fear that a great change will only bring temporary respite before it all gets sort of bleak again. But I'm doing my best to motivate myself."
