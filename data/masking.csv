"Essentially it is masking your autistic traits in order to fit in. It is very prevalent with older autistic people like myself who were never diagnosed at a young age. For me it involved studying lots of old movies so I could match what people said to their facial expressions ( old movies were good for that as they overemphasized they’re facial expressions). It involved practicing what I was going to say for every conceivable interaction with other people. It’s all in an attempt to outwardly appear “normal”. I though for the longest time I thought that everyone was like me but just better at being human. 

The big problem with masking is that it takes a great deal of effort and concentration and leads to burnout. Sometime to the point of going non verbal. It also leads to depression and other nasty mental illnesses like anxiety disorders."
"Autistic people behave in certain ways that are obvious to non-autistic people as autistic, or at least not ""normal"". 

Lots of neurotypical people don't react well if you behave in a way that's obviously autistic, so lots of autistic people learn to mask: which is when you force yourself to act in ways that people expect you to. Do things that don't come naturally to you but do come naturally to autistic people.

It varies a lot depending on the individual, but common examples are:

\- Forcing facial expressions that don't come naturally because people think you don't feel anything otherwise

\- Forcing yourself to stay still when you'd rather be stimming

\- Talking in ways that neurotypical people expect you to talk. Like saying ""how are you?"" when you don't actually care, feigning interest in people's hobbies and not just talking about your own interests, that kind of thing. 

\- Maintaining eye contact even though it makes you uncomfortable.

It's exhausting because you need to be pretty much actively doing it the whole time during conversation. But it can also be troublesome if, like me, you're no good at doing it, so people can usually work out pretty quickly that you're autistic."
"Neurotypical people tend to be uncomfortable around some people with autism when their traits are obvious, in order to fit in people will attempt to mask these traits so as to pass as a neurotypical person."
"You know how you put a high-powered graphics card in a computer, and you can play AAA games at full frame rates with no glitches? That’s because the card supplies hardware acceleration for graphics. It’s specifically designed to be really good and really fast at specialized, complicated calculations needed to render smooth, high-quality video.

Most people’s brains have “hardware acceleration” for social interactions. They know instantly, without thinking about it, what people’s facial expressions and body language mean, how their tone of voice sounds to other people, and so on. Autistic people lack that. It’s like running on integrated graphics. The CPU has to do everything... and man, does it get hot!

“Masking” is pushing that CPU full-throttle — still dropping frames, tearing, reducing quality — trying to keep up with a game that was meant to run on different hardware, and trying not to let anybody notice."
"Basically it's when someone who is autistic suppresses their autistic traits (not always possible and occasionally painful) to try to appear """"""normal""""""

Happens with ADHD folks too, can say from experience"
You ever have to go somewhere you hate but know it would be impolite to wear said annoyance around so you put on a happy face and pretend to be fine. It's that but for autistic symptoms. If you've worked retail customer service face is the same basic concept.
"A little anecdote about masking: I took the Meyers Briggs personality test once. I ended up getting a result completely different from what I expected. I realized that the test had asked me what I would do in a given situation, but that it didn't distinguish between what I would **WANT** to do, and what I would **CHOOSE** do. Essentially my natural behaviours, and those I had learned by masking were at odds.

Its quite similar to stage acting actually. Except that your role is a persona you have to have on all the time. I guess its something movie-stars deal with too."
"Some people have difficulties understanding social interactions. They need to see what other people do and try to imitate it. It's like being born without an instruction manual for social interactions, and having to create one from scratch through observation."
"Autistic masking, or camouflaging, is when someone with autism tries to hide or suppress their autistic traits in social situations. They might imitate behaviors that are considered ""normal"" or hide repetitive movements or behaviors that are typical for them. It's like putting on a mask to fit in and avoid standing out. However, masking can be really tiring and stressful for people with autism because they have to constantly monitor and control their natural tendencies. It can make it harder for them to express themselves and may affect their overall well-being."
"It's a series of behaviors meant to mask the otherness of being autistic, usually in an attempt to fit in or avoid discrimination.

For instance, I tend to make vastly different assumptions while I speak or write, combined with the inclusion of sound effects and rhythmic patterns,  plus the rarity of finding topics distasteful, means that my natural mode of talking is strange and annoying to most people. I also cry a lot whenever I talk about anything and get absorbed in the conversation, which disrupts the conversation with people asking if I'm okay, and putting people off with my sniffling. As a result, I mask my natural speaking voice by adopting a higher pitch, and adopting a detached and technical speech style. This prevents the weird speaking habits, and (usually) prevents me from getting too worked up about the topic of discussion.

It's not perfect, and causes its own problems, but it's often better than the alternative."
"Normal people will intuitively have a normal conversation, make normal facial expressions, laugh at normal times, get a normal amount of excited over normal topics.  
  
I (autistic) will have a conversation and will do all the same things, but only after years of intentional studying and copying how other people act.  
  
It is not intuitive.It is difficult, stressful, and exhausting. But because I've been doing it for years, it has become the usual way I interact with other people, so much so that I have lost touch with my own personality.  
That's masking.  
  
And the catch is that even when I'm masking as best as I can, other people notice that something is off about me and will often just say I'm weird or creepy or my ""vibe is off""."
"As an analogy, imagine learning handwriting. For most people, it becomes muscle memory. When writing a ""T"" for example, you can do it without even thinking about the structure and telling yourself ""okay, first draw the horizontal line at the top, then, from its center, draw a vertical line to the bottom"". Maybe the first couple of times you do have to do that, but now when you write a ""T"" your body just *does* it without you thinking about the shape.

Now suppose that, for some reason, you just *can't* get this through muscle memory. Every single time you write a ""T"", you have to think ""ok horizontal line, then vertical line from the center down"". But the more you do it, the faster you're able to go through this thought process, and the better you do it. Almost to the point that you're looking as proficient at handwriting as any normal person. However, unlike a normal person, who is doing it via muscle memory without thinking, you are thinking about the shape of every letter you write. Therefore, even though you can pass yourself off as a normal writer, you can't keep it up as long because it is *far* more exhausting for you. Thinking of the shape of every letter is a major cognitive load that normal hand-writers don't have to worry about.

This is what autistic people go through, but instead of handwriting, it's reading and displaying social cues. Things such as understanding people's facial expressions and inferring their emotions from it, displaying your own facial expressions to express your feelings, understanding when you're reaching somebody's boundary of comfort from the tone of their voice, etc. This is something that neurotypical people learn to do by ""muscle memory"", and they don't have to think about it. But autistic people *always* have to think about it. We get better and better at doing it as we live and interact with more people. But it will *always* require cognitive effort, it will never be ""muscle memory"". 

That's what ""masking"" is. Looking like we're as good at reading and responding to social cues as normal people, because we get more and more proficient at doing the mental exercise. But we can still never keep it up as long as normal people because it will never be automatic for us, it will always require conscious effort."

"It's basically expending effort & focus to appear ""normal"". People are assholes. It's socially easier to play pretend so people don't notice

You know those memes about ""now you're breathing manually""? Imagine that, but for every social behaviour you exhibit. It also involves consciously suppressing the ""undesirable"" things that people find annoying. 

It's exhausting, and can reinforce feelings of social isolation due to the fact you're basically talking through a social glass screen; the alien pretending to fit in"
"For those who were diagnosed later in life, did you have children & did your children have autism or were they on the spectrum at all?"
"When we try to act normal to avoid being seen as “low functioning” or “weird”. Though I have absolutely no idea how to mask so I end up looking 9, even tho I’m nearly 16"
"I'm fairly sure I have very high functioning autism. Never diagnosed, but it would explain SO MUCH of my behaviors, ticks, and way of thinking. Should I get myself tested? Is there any benefit to getting diagnosed? Or should I just continue as I am?"
"You don’t practice making expressions in the mirror?

Everyone masks.  Those that do so more naturally or without conscious effort are deemed neurotypical."
"When I’m around people, I make myself act like them. I have a persona that is an amalgamation of everything that’s socially acceptable. I have to tone down or completely “mask” my reactions to things.

Since my intense and unfiltered reactions to some things are weird or annoying (I audibly gag at some textures and stim a lot physically), I hide them because people treat me differently when I’m not masking around them.

I’m able to be around close friends and family without hiding my neurodivergent traits, but with most people I suppress myself, and that takes so much effort."
"It's living in hell, all your life. It's pretending to be someone you're not in an attempt to survive and succeed, even if what you're doing goes against everything your body/mind is telling you to do.

Think of a neurotypical person and their typical social motions: looking people in the face, understanding social cues, being relatively comfortable with common things like going to the store or perhaps some other social gathering (let's not even get into large gatherings and tons of noise/lights/smells), understanding and being able to identify or regulate your emotions, not being highly sensitive to one or more primary senses (sound, temperature, light, odor, etc.).... the list goes on.

Now take those things and make it so the social norm is the exact opposite, and in order to survive or succeed you have to learn how to do these things, but you don't really learn them and understand them, it's more that you've memorized the steps to the dance and have practiced and practiced until you can get it right even though it's not genuine.

Now take that scenario and make the neurotypical world the default, and autists have to figure out hownto live in that world. That is autistic masking. It's pure hell every day and it causes a ton of depression, anxiety, and other things. Medicine can take the edge off, but that's it."
"ELI5: make an effort to appear normal.

It is masking your condition to blend with neurotypical people. It usually consumes a lot more resources than neurotypicals can imagine and causes a lot of mental fatigue"
"It is when someone who has autism has to act like they don't have autism, to fit in with people who don't have autism.

Often it is just societal bullshit, especially when the autism is merely mild autism, or ""high functioning"" autism. Society should simply accept those people as they are, instead of them feeling that they should have to mask.

Fuck most of society and fuck the people that cause people with autism to have to mask."

I've described it as suppressing the urge to stick my head under the chocolate fondue fountain because I know it's socially unacceptable but still wanting to very badly
"Autistic guy here, ive known that people maso but i havent that much, whenever i mask, its because i dont want to be chastised at school, a public place, etc. Although recently ive been trying not to since i feel more free. Basically it comes down to this in the simplest terms
A ""defense mechanism"" that ensures you arent socially chastised and called out in public"
"I'm glad you explained that so well. I have friends that are going through some of the same things...it took a minute for me to catch on...getting close to someone that has autistic mannerisms, well you pick up on it if you really pay attention to them. I felt as if I was violating something private by asking but was relieved to find out that they were so open about it and relieved to have someone else they could be honest and really themselves with...one of my dearest friends..."
"Avoiding tasks and stuff that could possibly expose you -  and it makes it worse because I get a little a anxious and overwhelmed trying and doing new things and even though I have good intentions everything always , always go wrong.

I've always been the type to want to do something last, or do it alone in the middle of the night so no fear of judgement. I would wake up in the middle of the night to do my homework at like 2 or 3 am because I hated doing it in front of my family. My mom would try to help but never be able to answer the questions I had and it made me so upset that I would never truly understand anything I'm doing . (ADHD/possible)"
"As children, our behaviours are constantly corrected to be ""neurotypical"" behaviours - which really means, the behaviours that society has decided are acceptable and which come more naturally to people who are not autistic. 

We learn very quickly that only a neurotypical presentation is ""acceptable"" and if we want to stay out of trouble, make friends, get and keep jobs eventually, we have to pretend to be neurotypical.

Imagine being an actor, on stage all day long, constantly trying to remember the ""right"" lines, and facial expressions to make in every scene, constantly judging whether you got it right. That would be really exhausting wouldn't it?

And that is how we live when we mask. Permanently exhausted, and that's before you add on sensory stimulation and all the others things that eat away at our fabric.

I was diagnosed aged 43, and masking is still the most damaging thing I do to myself."
"Imagine a robot who looks just like a human. Now imagine them doing robot stuff. That's natural for them but wierd for you. 

Now imagine being a robot trying to pretend to be a human and blend in, it's not natural. They may get good at it and or they may be terrible at it, you might notice something off about them, but either way it's mentally exhausting and takes a toll on them to analyse and second-guess the correct way to move and behave.

This is just an analogy but I guess some autistic people won't be happy being called robots. Ive been called a terminator in the past but I'm not bothered by it."
"Could someone ELI5 how this differs (neurologically, and in other ways) from using social judgment? For example, I may feel an impulse to interrupt my colleague, but I make the decision not to; or I want to roll my eyes at something someone said, but I decide not to out of politeness. My burning truth may be that I still hate my colleague or want to roll my eyes, but I suppress it to keep the peace or to keep a strategic advantage. Is the NT/ND difference in how much energy or resources it requires to conceal these real reactions?"
"As someone who was diagnosed (technically with Aspergers) at 32, it was mind blowing to me when I found out that other people didn’t practice potential social interactions and conversations. Like how tf do you know what to say and how to act if you didn’t practice?!?"
It's exhausting.
"It’s funny, how at times I felt the same way - that everyone was like you and I, but better at it doing it. And later, as a teenager, how lonesome it was, like nobody else struggled like us, trying to act and “be” normal. 

I am so grateful that there is so much better awareness and understanding of it today, for the sake of our kids."
"I'm autistic and my work is in a related field.

FYI, there is no such thing as ""going non-verbal."" Non-verbal autistic people can express fewer than 20 words or signs to communicate at any time.

You're talking about shutdown and selected mutism during periods of overstimulation.

I see people saying ""I go non-verbal"" all the time, and it's taken on a colloquial meaning, but that's really to the detriment of people who are actually non-verbal, a much more serious symptom.

So, please make an effort to correct your terminology and encourage others to be more accurate."
"Huh, I've just learned I've been masking for nearly 40 years and didn't even know it.  It's gotten to the point that I don't even know who I really am anymore and I am just able to fit in with pretty much any group."
Who do you talk to for a diagnosis? This basically sums up how I’ve lived my life. Typically I like avoiding talking all together because I don’t want to make mistakes when it’s not a conversation I have practiced. And I don’t want to accidentally react wrong. It’s interesting to know that I’m not alone in doing this now though
"My daughter was recently diagnosed and it has made me think/realize I must have it as well. This describes my childhood as well: studying others to learn how to act, not getting it, not fitting in. Masking successfully later (in high school and college) but also experiencing burnout, hating my own brain and life in general, and drinking heavily because it turned off my brain and made social interactions much easier.

Im 35 and newly sober and still trying to figure it all out. Honestly I don’t know if I have ASD or just social anxiety or what but definitely something is going on. Something that's interesting to me is that this has gotten better for me as I've gotten older. I've been able to train myself and get more comfortable as I've grown and matured and gone through life experiences. I'm reading from others in this thread that that's not typical for ASD so really I don't know what to think."
"I'm late diagnosed myself.  Currently 51 and, after Covid everyone seems to have transformed into their literal social media personalities.  Everyone seems so hostile and quick to attack.  My previous scripts and research have to be completely redone.  It's really exhausting, especially at our age.  I just don't know if I want to put the time into it or just move somewhere else and completely isolate.  lol."
"burnout is real.  I've gotten to the point where I just don't want to be around other people anymore, ever."
"I have a permafrown because of all the concentration is takes. It worked out though, because I'm in my mid-sixties and my face is wrinkle-free, lol"
This is also a super useful skill for sociopaths and serial killers!
"Sounds traumatic, as commendable as that is"
"Fuck me, am I autistic? I’ve never watched anything to match facial expressions but have practiced in the mirror. Always have practiced any conversation and how to respond in my head."
"Otherwise known as socialization.

We're all wearing masks and uniforms, dude."

[Me in a nutshell.](https://imgur.com/a/tanRmcU)
So would a therapist be able to diagnose autism?
"Fuck me, I should probably see someone about a diagnosis, because this is sounding way too familiar"
"Everything you said here encapsulates me. I was diagnosed at 40. As soon as a situation didn't go according to plan, I got totally lost and struggled to function. The relief on diagnosis was very much my brain saying, ""My life and mental experiences make so much sense now.!"
"Dude, I feel your post.
And then you get real proud of yourself for seeming like a real person until you realise what you're actually thinking and it hits you; how screwed up that is that you don't think of yourself as a ""real person""."
"Oh hey it's me. The bottom half. I'm currently dealing with those issues, but trying to get away from the ganja and focusing my life. Although that doesnt help with the autism lol"
"This right here is one of the best answers of this thread and should really be the top comment. Masking is not unique to autism, but as you have done a great job describing, autistics have to mask certain differences related to the areas you described."
Sounds a lot like customer service roles in most jobs.
">Talking in ways that neurotypical people expect you to talk. Like saying ""how are you?"" when you don't actually care, feigning interest in people's hobbies and not just talking about your own interests, that kind of thing

Now I'm concerned there's a bunch of people thinking ""I might be autistic!"" when they're just arrogant, self-centered and rude."
"i do all of that and i couldnt explain it any better or at all actually lol

personally eye contact is the worst even with best friends (the only people I can look in the eyes comfortably are the people i genuinely love (my sister and my then-gf)), I become almost literally paralized, like all of sudden I was put inside some casting.

When it comes to facial expressions I usually just copy the other person or try act accordingly to the way they said something (its hard af when its a stranger tho)"
"\-I‘m bad at this. Luckily the phrase “resting bitch-face” came out, and I can usually get a laugh out of my coworkers if I use the right tone when I use it to excuse myself, but family photos are still a problem.

\-A big issue. I stop myself from pacing by sitting down, but I still need to move so I jiggle my leg. But my family doesn’t like it when I jiggle, because it rattles the couch, so I have to keep reminding myself or being reminded to sit still and it’s stressful.  

\-I have literal scripts that I go through, and if something comes up that I don’t have a script for, it’s like a computer crash.

\-I manage the eye contact thing with the old “look at their forehead, not their eyes” trick, but I’m still self-conscious and I keep wondering if I’m blinking enough or they’ll think I’m staring at them."
"I have a hard time understanding how this is much different than neurotypical people. I'm not autistic, but all of these (apart from eye contact) are very relatable and I know I'm not the only non-autistic person who experiences that."
I'm in this post and I don't like it.
BRB going to get tested.
im in these comments snd i dont like it
The trick is to think it’s sort of a mini-game and it becomes fun. Otherwise it is exhausting.
As someone with ADHD and something that causes me to have motor tics (mainly facial and much more prevalent when tired) I have spent 20 years masking my ADHD in public and around most people because “it’s not normal” to act the way my brain wants to. It is truly exhausting as you said. Most of my socks end up with holes in the toes because one thing I do is constantly curl my toes to take my brain off of “needing” to fidget/move.
"> Talking in ways that neurotypical people expect you to talk. Like saying ""how are you?"" when you don't actually care, feigning interest in people's hobbies and not just talking about your own interests, that kind of thing. 

To avoid a bunch of neurotypical people from self diagnosing, just because you do these as well doesn't mean you're autistic. ""How are you doing"" is a typical greeting that people just say even when they don't want an actual answer. ""Fine"" and ""good, how are you"" are the typical and expected answers. Not everyone is into the same hobbies and sometimes they just aren't interested in what someone else is talking about. Feigning interest is the polite thing to do."
Yeah I notice people are a little uncomfortable around me - and then I feel their uncomfortableness because I'm scanning their body language etc. Meds have helped in that regard and I usually start the convos to make less awkward. Though I am self medicated right now with nothing official 😆
It still blows my mind that there are people that don't practice/prep every conversation they expect to have and have never had to study and practice mimicking body language.
"It actually happens with a lot of mental health disorders such as depression, social anxiety, and PTSD. Masking is not unique to autism. What is unique for all of these is what they are masking."
"I used to talk to my dad about how I did much better at work when I mirrored other people’s emotions, movements and differences in speech such as cadence and direction. I made a personality for each person I dealt with. He said that was what he did so I figured everyone did that. 

This was a good solution when I was an engineer and didn’t really talk to people that much. Mostly just sat in a cube and coded. For reasons I switched into management and I couldn’t personalize for each person and had to build a consistent character. My mental health dropped immediately after getting promoted.  I was so exhausted after every meeting.

After years of this I’m going back into engineering."
Nailed it completely

Autism is when you like chocolate?
I don't have autism but I do have social anxiety and I do think of situations in my head of where I will need to say something.
Yeah. I was diagnosed at 53 and it was quite shocked myself. I was always amazed how other people could keep track of conversations when I’m a group. I’m ok one on one but as a few more people and I’m totally lost. I was always so jealous of people with social skills. I thought they must have practiced really hard.
"To be clear almost everyone practices some things,  job interviews,  asking out your crush,  asking your boss for a raise."
"Everybody masks sometimes. Nobody is their true authentic self all the time, that's impossible. And yes NTs absolutely do practice conversations.

The difference in autism is always the severity. Every ""problem"" an autistic person has can sound like a normal human problem when you isolate it. But it's the frequency, duration, and severity of these issues that are much higher with autism. 

Obviously this doesn't really address the idea of being wired differently as there are lots of different ways to look at autism. But I think it's important to remember that every person experiences some autistic traits some of the time.

I'm not downplaying anybody's personal struggle, my whole family is ND."
"I don't have an autism diagnosis, but I'm on a waiting list to get assessed. I'm 36 and when I started practicing social interactions (20s ish)  and preparing my intro for phone conversations, I suddenly got so much better at that stuff.

My spouse looked at me like I was an alien when I asked them if they do that too because they're so good at conversations and professional interactions. They were like ...no?"
"This reminds me of a situation the other day where I had to remind my wife how much I depend on pre-prepared reactions to social situations, in a situation where I absolutely did not read the room nor consider the implications of that very specific situation."
if it makes you feel better im 39 known i was autistic for about 3 years and im just finding this out :D
"Shit.

I thought that was normal."
"Thing is, A LOT of people who aren't on the spectrum don't know what to say or how to interact properly with others either. These are people usually referred to as ""rude"", ""lack tact"" or ""lack delicacy"", etc."
Oh I might be autistic
"I don't know if this is normal, but I sort of make up scenarios where I'm explaining something and practice that way, with whatever's on my mind at the moment."
"Heh, I've been there. The plus of that is that you become more conscious about yourself, while others that look like the most normal ones may be surprised in some situation and get angry, disoriented, emotional beyond their control.

The next step of ""rehearsing interactions"" is kinda fake it till you make it. After many of them, trying well and attitude of not being an asshole and actually aiming at being good human flow in interactions comes by itself."
Technically Asperger is still autism but this term was introduced by a  nazi scientist who wanted to distinguish between high and low “function ing “ autistic peeps
A good many of us do. We have social anxiety.
Have you seen the show The Rehearsal?
And it gets harder and more exhausting the older you get. You’d think it would get easier over time but for some reason it’s the opposite. My recovery days are starting to really ad up now.
I know that. You know that. But most other people don’t know that and it’s just easier to say than going in to a lengthy explanation of what it is that is actually happening.
"This could be code switching, which is when you behave and speak in certain ways around certain groups because that's how they respond best to you. This isn't unique to being neurodivergent, it's pretty common part of socialisation. If you don't have people you can 'switch off' around, you may feel like you lose your sense of self.

Masking is more about supressing or downplaying aspects of yourself to fit in. Like, forcing yourself to appear calm in situations where you are actually very uncomfortable, or stopping yourself from talking about certain topics because you don't want to come across as weird."
"Right there with you. 52 years old and I'm beginning to realize I don't know which parts of my behaviours are ""me"" and which parts are adaptations and masking."
You sound like my twin. Haha.
"Find a psychiatrist that specializes in autism spectrum disorder. It will involve a bunch of test and can take some time. And it can be expensive. I was lucky, or unlucky, enough to have had a complete breakdown that led to seeing a psychiatrist who made the connections and decided to administer the tests. I ended up not needing to pay."
"Autism is generally regarded as hereditary so it’s possible! The other thing is that you can be extroverted and enjoy people and still be autistic. 

Myself as an example: I’m great with people but part of my social fauxpaw struggles are that I do not understand boundaries of like what’s appropriate to say to whom. I happen to be really nice to people and compliment others regularly and this comes off as me being naive, nice, or two faced depending on who you ask and what they’ve been through. This behavior though isn’t commonly noticed as autism because I don’t come off as the stereotypical “rude” or “aloof”. 

So part of the social aspects of autism are also examined within a cultural lens. If you have someone who’s autistic but grew up in California or the south, they might be regarded as rude, but put them in New York City and they might fit in a little more in that aspect. Now that doesn’t mean autism suddenly vanishes when you enter a new region, it just means certain traits or behaviors are (especially socially) are going be highlighted more or less. The sensory aspects and brain structure and function don’t change. 

I hope this makes sense. I by no means am saying that someone is or isn’t autistic or that autism isn’t real. Just that cultural expectations can highlight or minimize certain social behaviors autists might exhibit."
"I think there’s more to it than that.

I don’t speak body language. I have learned that certain poses are supposed to mean certain things- I’ve basically pieced together a phrasebook. But I can’t really understand anyone else’s body language without consciously thinking about it. I think most people don’t do that.

I know eye contact is a big thing. The only information I’m getting when I make eye contact with somebody is what color their eyes are. I think other people are getting some more out of it than that. I try to make the right amount of eye contact during conversations, but i have to think about it."
Ah. There’s always one.
Getting a diagnosis doesn’t really change things. It validates your experiences and it helps you put a name to stuff. It also allows you to get some help accommodations from work or school. But it really doesn’t make things better.
"They aren't allowed to.  Each of the four I spoke with said the same thing: ""we definitely can't diagnose autism, but here's a list of people that can and you may enjoy reading this stack of literature about autism as well""."
As far as I am aware they cannot.
I fully understand the not going to plan part. I used to be a truck driver. It was good because I worked alone and there was a routine. But as soon as the routine was changed at the last minute I would become irrationally angry. One small change and I would fall apart. I never knew why I had those extreme reaction to change of routine. Now I do.
"and still you think that you are the right person to judge a policeofficer killing a 17 yo kid. 

Im sure you represent the average human regarding emotions, morals and general consideration of what is right and what is wrong."
"The term originates from autistic people, but plenty of people who aren't autistic do some thing similar, yes"
"Thanks for pointing that out. For a moment I was like ""Have I been autistic my whole life without knowing""."
A notoriously draining role
"Part of this is a matter of degree. Yes, we all have the experience of at times not wanting to say hello, or being worried that what we are really thinking or feeling is not the best or most appropriate for that situation but for autistics these problems are more highly prevalent and they may struggle with being able to adopt a facial expression that looks more genuine or typically struggle to truly understand the need or the why of social behaviors. A good example is a 45 year old man who told me it took him until he was 35 to realize that it is important to say thank you, not that he understood why, just that to other people it was important. Also please understand too that we are much better in the past 20 years in helping autistics with gaining this type of information so someone who doesn't ""look"" autistic may be masking. The best thing to do is if you think you have a problem ( and trust me you would get a fair amount of feedback from others if you did) then you should try to see a qualified mental health specialist."
The difference is that neurotypical people do this stuff naturally without having to really think about it. For autistic people it takes a lot of active effort to remind yourself to seem interested
"Same - I rehearse before every work conversation because it helps me feel more in control. Even the most benign ones. 

My manager told me once that I was a hard person to read and it made me feel awful because I feel like I really try to be expressive."
"I think a lot of people do it, autistic or not. I'm very good at talking with people and have no difficulty doing it (I did as a kid but then somehow everything changed when I hit high school), but I still mentally replicate situations and conversations over and over and over, I spend a lot of time overthinking and imagining what I would say in X setting. This leads me to being overcharged and basically a freight train of words, and also allowed me in the past to pretty easily handle being on a stage or talking to complete strangers without any preparation.

The gist is, a lot of people do it to some extent, it helps with improving your readiness for public situations and talks, whatever your baseline is. I still wouldn't say *it's a good thing*. Don't think that you should be like this if you are not. There pros and cons and I'm pretty sure overthinking and rumination cause me a lot of anxiety."
"Is the crowded room issue due to your mind trying to track all conversations at once?

That's what always trips me up. I can be in a conversation with the person right in front of me, desperately trying to concentrate on what they're saying, but my brain is got the clicker going, just cycling through every conversation in the room, like it's trying to find a show it wants to watch.  God forbid there's an actual television in my line of sight. 

Then I realize that the person in front of me has been speaking for however long, but I wasn't hearing them. So I have to scramble to try and remember what words I picked up from them while my brain was flipping through all the other conversations."
"Did you constantly hear ""could do better?"" as a kid?

""Could do better"" was the mainstay of all my school reports.

Except I couldn't do better. But still, to this day, I can't get out of that mindset... if only I'd done better!

Diagnosed at 43."
"All of those things are times when you want to make a good impression, so it makes sense to ""practice"". The difference seems to be that non-autism people don't need to ""practice"" regular social interaction such as with their friends."
"Do non-autistic people have ""set pieces""?  Specific bits of dialogue that you use in similar social situations, e. g. when speaking to other parents at a playground, or strangers on a bus?"
"That’s very similar to how that conversation went for me. 

I’m the same way, it’s hard for me to “argue” with my partner if I wasn’t ready for the conversation. She can just spin me in circles. She’s learned to give me a heads up for any difficult conversations. Makes them go much more smoothly for both of us."
"Lmao. I’ve lost count of the amount of times that I’ve said something that’s pissed off everybody and then had to have my girl explain to me why everybody was mad at me. 

I’ve gotten better and learned to not always say what I think. But I honestly can’t wrap my mind around how people get mad when all I did is say out loud exactly what just happened."
"Yes. My diagnosis is now “high functioning autism”. They don’t use Aspergers anymore in a clinical setting. But that’s a pretty recent change. 

Random side note: 

When I was first getting diagnosed, I didn’t understand the spectrum at all. I just kept getting angry and saying “I’M NOT RETARDED!” (She finally got me to agree to the test when she told me “I bet people tell you that you are a jerk or an asshole very often, and you can’t figure out why because all you did is explain what is happening”). 

When the therapist finally got me to take a few test and stop fighting her. She explained Aspergers to me in great detail for almost an hour. 

My response was “so I’m Autistic, but only the good parts?” She laughed her ass off for a good minute before telling me that was the most Asperger response she’s ever heard."
"I've seen people use that term in autistic forums and subreddits, where people should know. I'm not convinced that even they know that. I think it's a misconception the majority of people, autistic or not, have and that it should be corrected."
"Lol, at first I thought you were saying you had a twin with autism."
Shit sucks!
Thanks for the response! Hopefully my insurance will cover some of the costs
"Yeah, but in the end we're all on the spectrum to a certain degree. The point is to not make the human condition itself into one form or another of a disease.

(Left as the traditional exercise for the reader.)"

"I had a surprise visit from my mum and grandparents. It messed me up for days. I hadn't long been out of hospital and had just planned on relaxing on the sofa. Seeing them was obviously a better thing, my mind was blown that they were there."
"Yeah, that is one of the problems right now with everyone talking about masking and not having much information about it. It is hard because people don't know what is a common human experience, what is a common experience among different experience of different disorders, and what is more specific. I am glad we are now more open about our experiences but sometimes people go a bit overboard. The best thing to do honestly is if you are noticing something about yourself that you are concerned about is to try and talk to a professional and find one you feel comfortable being honest with."
"It wasn’t until this year (I’m 29) that I realized that when people are making conversation and asking me how things are going, what I do for work, etc., I should ask them questions back and I was probably seeming rude or self-centered all this time. But that’s just a bit of my obliviousness in some areas. As I said before, I’m not autistic. 

I think a lot of people are reading about a couple autism traits or some anecdotes from autistic people online and jumping to the conclusion that they have autism. It really takes a clinician with a holistic (meaning whole person and environment, not “holistic medicine”) approach to make an accurate diagnosis. People are tend to be pretty bad at accurate self-aware. 

Anyway, you probably know all these so I might just be preaching to choir. I just wanted to add that perspective for anyone else reading this."
"Its probably because your 'acting' rather than  letting your natural words and body language do its thing, overthinking essentially. Expressive people tend to go with the flow"
"It sucks they said that, but it may just be that THEY have a hard time reading you (maybe because they don't know well enough) and they are generalising. Keep at it, you're doing great !"
"Is this an autism thing? I've experienced this, not a great time."
"For me (diagnosed autistic) it's that I hear ALL THE SOUNDS at once, like having a hundred TVs all on different channels, so it can be almost impossible trying to filter out the one conversation I'm trying to pay attention to."
"I have an auditory processing disorder that manifests itself when trying to understand people when there is back ground noise, especially voices"
I have very few memories of my childhood. Almost none. But I do have stories from from when I was a child told to me. Similar to you. Could do better. Need to participate more. Doesn’t apply himself.
Exactly.  Just wanted to make sure a bunch of people didn't start diagnosing themselves because they've practiced a conversation a few times
"What if they can't anticipate well enough to practice, but seem to always either mess up in small ways they didn't realize they were doing but that turned out to actually be big ways, or else be worried about what little things they still haven't realized they're doing?"
"I think so but it depends on how long you mean. I know I have a couple funny stories that work in certain settings and certain topics I know make good responses to common topics (local sports,  weather,  etc)

But they aren't word for word or anything"
"""Schtick"", it's called"
"If you’re talking about “canned responses?” Yes and no. You could argue that small talk is largely canned questions and responses, with some variation. I think the difference lies in the degree at variation and response fluidity when it’s necessary to go “off script.” When switching to improv, so to speak.

I would imagine “off script”  improv mode is more difficult for those with autism?"
">it’s hard for me to “argue” with my partner if I wasn’t ready for the conversation.

Yuuuup. I'm a little better at it now (due to a lot of research and practice, lol classic) but I'm one of the world's worst arguers. If you give me your arguments on paper and send me off for few days, I can write you a beautiful rebuttal. But in the moment I'm just slack-jawed.

We've got better at communicating too. I joke (dark humour) that is a good thing my spouse isn't abusive because they could gaslight the shit out of me, it would be about a morning's work and I'd never have an independent thought again. On a serious note, it makes it so easy for me to see how autistic people suffer higher levels of domestic abuse. For a lot of us, it would be the easiest thing in the world to love-bomb us, then turn to emotional manipulation."
I connect with this HARD.
Neurodivergent power✊🏼
"Self diagnosis is mostly valid if you’re honest. There are some , however, that diagnose just to belong. It’s a weird dynamic."
"Not really concerned about anything. Lets say that I didn't enjoy talking with people as much. I'm fine with the Family and close friends circles, but outside of that I rarely care, so I just fake it."
"I believe it's a stimulus filtering issue, which is true of ASD and ADHD, afaik. 

Being unable to, or having to exert lots of mental energy to focus on a single conversation, and usually only being sort of successful.

Sometimes having all the conversations and noise in a room come thundering into your brain at once. 

Before I took my diagnosis seriously, I just thought I was an introverted extrovert. In short bursts, I enjoy socializing even in groups.

I didn't realize that I was so drained afterwards because of all the additional mental strain to listen, to filter sounds, then generally to bullshit to cover up how much I missed while my mind was being overwhelmed by stimulus. Even the times that the din was so loud in my head that I wanted to cover my ears, I'd just ride that out and keep nodding and smiling. 

After a big group thing, I'd often take days or even weeks where I minimized contact with others, to recharge. 

Full disclosure: I'm not a doctor, and I've never been formally diagnosed with ASD. I have been diagnosed many times as ADHD (ADD at the time, so ADHD-I by the current definition.)"
Yeah there’s a big issue online these days of people naming something that is quite common and attaching it to autism or adhd
"I don't mean stories, I mean pre-set answers (words, gestures, and inflections) to all expected questions like ""how was your vacation"" or ""what do you do"" or ""have you lived in Ruritania long?"""
"It is, but if one has enough canned responses it's almost never necessary.  Kind of like playing chess - at first you have to improvise in response to every move the opponent makes, but after a few thousand games read and analyzed you know that it's an  X attack and you simply respond with a Y defence."
Yes. People with autism need to watch out for narcissists. They’ll spin you in circles and you won’t be able to “justify” any of your (valid) emotions because you just can’t keep up with the conversation
"I'm kind of going through the process now. I'd figured I have ADHD and reached out for a diagnosis on that.

And not that it can't be both, but after talking to me, the psychiatrist thought ASD was a strong possibility and I've had to reach out to people specializing in this for another test (not taken yet)

This was something I'd experienced a few times and it took on a different context in light of the possibility of ASD."
"It’s something else to learn how to do that kind of filtering with active cognition that doesn’t overload the brain. 

What’s funny to me is that basically we’re getting minimally to unfiltered data straight to our brains. 

In a conversation with a professor of neuropsychopharmacology, I inquired what it would be if one altered how they process their sensory perceptions consciously and conscientiously rather than unconsciously and uncontrollably in the case of hallucinations, be they organic (due to brain or body issue) or chemically induced.

“That just sounds like normal filtering ability to me,” was his answer.

Wild how this scientific answer syncs with a Buddhist caution to not fully trust one’s own senses unless one is an arhat, bodhisattva or buddha, basically all the sentient beings who have experienced enlightenment."
"Yup, according to the CDC about 1.5% of males in the US are autistic. According to the people on some social media sites that number is around 65%. I’m half joking and no way this is meant to offend those that are actually diagnosed on the spectrum…..it’s all the “self diagnosed”"
"This is SUCH a great example and explanation, thank you - I’m not autistic but I have friends and family who are, and this is a brilliant concrete example of different ways to handle those types of social interaction."
"No not really. The only thing I can think of like that is if I'm walking my dog and we pass another dog walker I've got a few things I have preloaded to easily explain to other dog people my dog is nice,  but she's big and loud and if your dog gets nervous she'll get weird, so it might be best to keep your distance if your dog doesn't want to meet or you don't have time to. But there's a very specific reason that I've tried to boil that down to a phrase or two"
"I think that’s actually an excellent analogy. For most people, this happens passively and unconsciously over time. With autism, perhaps it’s more of an active and conscious process.

Similar to stimulus filtering but instead it’s response selection."
"I hope it goes well for you.  I have found it life changing to learn these things about myself, and to know where I'm different. Not because it really fixes any of the symptoms, but rather it helps me figure out if I can learn to cope, or at least learn to accept these things.

I still feel like an alien at times, but knowing definitely helps me accept it, to be at peace with who I am."
"Our brains are us. And our brains have no direct sensory capability, so everything we perceive is abstracted at least one layer out.  Plato's cave where our brains are trying to figure out the world but can only use the shadows cast on a cave wall.

Having done some experimentation myself, both with coping mechanisms for sensory issues, and tripping balls, I'm constantly amazed at the malleability of our perceptions."
Humans have been asking the same questions for all of our existence. Sometimes it’s just a difference in the language used to express the answer.
"misinformation is so rampant because of them these days. i had someone genuinely tell me that *blinking while you sneeze* is an autistic trait.

i also saw an instagram post where they said “autism makes me better in social situations, and if your afab it might do the same to you!” like??? i can understand picking up on small details with people you know (maybe someone clicks their fingers slightly before they get mad etc) but a major part of the disability is it’s impairment on social situations? wtaf are these people going on about"
Get stoned and watch the NOVA specials on the brain you’ll love it even if you’re already aware of the stuff.
"While I enjoy studying religion as philosophy as well as philosophy, I really am blown away by the places where science has caught up with ancient wisdom."
"Wow, people never cease to baffle. Thanks for sharing"
"LMAO

*blinking while sneezing* well we’re all autistic then I guess."
"It’s kind of reminiscent to “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Philosophy (and religion viewed through the lens of philosophy) developed through pure logic. We could only examine the mind.

But now we have the technology to examine the physical brain in process, and assign modern technical language to theories that far predate modern technology.

So now the hard science is starting to coincide with the soft science in areas."
Had a guy telling me that carbohydrates aren’t needed in a healthy diet and you should have zero carbohydrate intake. He got mad when I warned him he should probably be avoiding vegetables…
"Eh, a lot of people refer to extreme low carb diets as ""no-carb"", which it isn't really, but I can understand how someone might make that mistake if they are just following some basic rules and haven't really studied the matter much."
"Oh a lot of it boils down to a poor understanding of what a “carb” is. If I were being polite, I’d say they were failing to distinguish between carbohydrates generally and sugars specifically. Let alone nuances between refined/added sugars versus “natural” sugars. We’ll just leave glycemic index and glycemic load alone altogether."
"Essentially it is masking your autistic traits in order to fit in. It is very prevalent with older autistic people like myself who were never diagnosed at a young age. For me it involved studying lots of old movies so I could match what people said to their facial expressions ( old movies were good for that as they overemphasized they’re facial expressions). It involved practicing what I was going to say for every conceivable interaction with other people. It’s all in an attempt to outwardly appear “normal”. I though for the longest time I thought that everyone was like me but just better at being human. 

The big problem with masking is that it takes a great deal of effort and concentration and leads to burnout. Sometime to the point of going non verbal. It also leads to depression and other nasty mental illnesses like anxiety disorders."
"Autistic people behave in certain ways that are obvious to non-autistic people as autistic, or at least not ""normal"". 

Lots of neurotypical people don't react well if you behave in a way that's obviously autistic, so lots of autistic people learn to mask: which is when you force yourself to act in ways that people expect you to. Do things that don't come naturally to you but do come naturally to autistic people.

It varies a lot depending on the individual, but common examples are:

\- Forcing facial expressions that don't come naturally because people think you don't feel anything otherwise

\- Forcing yourself to stay still when you'd rather be stimming

\- Talking in ways that neurotypical people expect you to talk. Like saying ""how are you?"" when you don't actually care, feigning interest in people's hobbies and not just talking about your own interests, that kind of thing. 

\- Maintaining eye contact even though it makes you uncomfortable.

It's exhausting because you need to be pretty much actively doing it the whole time during conversation. But it can also be troublesome if, like me, you're no good at doing it, so people can usually work out pretty quickly that you're autistic."
"Neurotypical people tend to be uncomfortable around some people with autism when their traits are obvious, in order to fit in people will attempt to mask these traits so as to pass as a neurotypical person."
"You know how you put a high-powered graphics card in a computer, and you can play AAA games at full frame rates with no glitches? That’s because the card supplies hardware acceleration for graphics. It’s specifically designed to be really good and really fast at specialized, complicated calculations needed to render smooth, high-quality video.

Most people’s brains have “hardware acceleration” for social interactions. They know instantly, without thinking about it, what people’s facial expressions and body language mean, how their tone of voice sounds to other people, and so on. Autistic people lack that. It’s like running on integrated graphics. The CPU has to do everything... and man, does it get hot!

“Masking” is pushing that CPU full-throttle — still dropping frames, tearing, reducing quality — trying to keep up with a game that was meant to run on different hardware, and trying not to let anybody notice."
"Basically it's when someone who is autistic suppresses their autistic traits (not always possible and occasionally painful) to try to appear """"""normal""""""

Happens with ADHD folks too, can say from experience"
You ever have to go somewhere you hate but know it would be impolite to wear said annoyance around so you put on a happy face and pretend to be fine. It's that but for autistic symptoms. If you've worked retail customer service face is the same basic concept.
"A little anecdote about masking: I took the Meyers Briggs personality test once. I ended up getting a result completely different from what I expected. I realized that the test had asked me what I would do in a given situation, but that it didn't distinguish between what I would **WANT** to do, and what I would **CHOOSE** do. Essentially my natural behaviours, and those I had learned by masking were at odds.

Its quite similar to stage acting actually. Except that your role is a persona you have to have on all the time. I guess its something movie-stars deal with too."
"Some people have difficulties understanding social interactions. They need to see what other people do and try to imitate it. It's like being born without an instruction manual for social interactions, and having to create one from scratch through observation."
"Autistic masking, or camouflaging, is when someone with autism tries to hide or suppress their autistic traits in social situations. They might imitate behaviors that are considered ""normal"" or hide repetitive movements or behaviors that are typical for them. It's like putting on a mask to fit in and avoid standing out. However, masking can be really tiring and stressful for people with autism because they have to constantly monitor and control their natural tendencies. It can make it harder for them to express themselves and may affect their overall well-being."
"It's a series of behaviors meant to mask the otherness of being autistic, usually in an attempt to fit in or avoid discrimination.

For instance, I tend to make vastly different assumptions while I speak or write, combined with the inclusion of sound effects and rhythmic patterns,  plus the rarity of finding topics distasteful, means that my natural mode of talking is strange and annoying to most people. I also cry a lot whenever I talk about anything and get absorbed in the conversation, which disrupts the conversation with people asking if I'm okay, and putting people off with my sniffling. As a result, I mask my natural speaking voice by adopting a higher pitch, and adopting a detached and technical speech style. This prevents the weird speaking habits, and (usually) prevents me from getting too worked up about the topic of discussion.

It's not perfect, and causes its own problems, but it's often better than the alternative."
"Normal people will intuitively have a normal conversation, make normal facial expressions, laugh at normal times, get a normal amount of excited over normal topics.  
  
I (autistic) will have a conversation and will do all the same things, but only after years of intentional studying and copying how other people act.  
  
It is not intuitive.It is difficult, stressful, and exhausting. But because I've been doing it for years, it has become the usual way I interact with other people, so much so that I have lost touch with my own personality.  
That's masking.  
  
And the catch is that even when I'm masking as best as I can, other people notice that something is off about me and will often just say I'm weird or creepy or my ""vibe is off""."
"As an analogy, imagine learning handwriting. For most people, it becomes muscle memory. When writing a ""T"" for example, you can do it without even thinking about the structure and telling yourself ""okay, first draw the horizontal line at the top, then, from its center, draw a vertical line to the bottom"". Maybe the first couple of times you do have to do that, but now when you write a ""T"" your body just *does* it without you thinking about the shape.

Now suppose that, for some reason, you just *can't* get this through muscle memory. Every single time you write a ""T"", you have to think ""ok horizontal line, then vertical line from the center down"". But the more you do it, the faster you're able to go through this thought process, and the better you do it. Almost to the point that you're looking as proficient at handwriting as any normal person. However, unlike a normal person, who is doing it via muscle memory without thinking, you are thinking about the shape of every letter you write. Therefore, even though you can pass yourself off as a normal writer, you can't keep it up as long because it is *far* more exhausting for you. Thinking of the shape of every letter is a major cognitive load that normal hand-writers don't have to worry about.

This is what autistic people go through, but instead of handwriting, it's reading and displaying social cues. Things such as understanding people's facial expressions and inferring their emotions from it, displaying your own facial expressions to express your feelings, understanding when you're reaching somebody's boundary of comfort from the tone of their voice, etc. This is something that neurotypical people learn to do by ""muscle memory"", and they don't have to think about it. But autistic people *always* have to think about it. We get better and better at doing it as we live and interact with more people. But it will *always* require cognitive effort, it will never be ""muscle memory"". 

That's what ""masking"" is. Looking like we're as good at reading and responding to social cues as normal people, because we get more and more proficient at doing the mental exercise. But we can still never keep it up as long as normal people because it will never be automatic for us, it will always require conscious effort."

"It's basically expending effort & focus to appear ""normal"". People are assholes. It's socially easier to play pretend so people don't notice

You know those memes about ""now you're breathing manually""? Imagine that, but for every social behaviour you exhibit. It also involves consciously suppressing the ""undesirable"" things that people find annoying. 

It's exhausting, and can reinforce feelings of social isolation due to the fact you're basically talking through a social glass screen; the alien pretending to fit in"
"For those who were diagnosed later in life, did you have children & did your children have autism or were they on the spectrum at all?"
"When we try to act normal to avoid being seen as “low functioning” or “weird”. Though I have absolutely no idea how to mask so I end up looking 9, even tho I’m nearly 16"
"I'm fairly sure I have very high functioning autism. Never diagnosed, but it would explain SO MUCH of my behaviors, ticks, and way of thinking. Should I get myself tested? Is there any benefit to getting diagnosed? Or should I just continue as I am?"
"You don’t practice making expressions in the mirror?

Everyone masks.  Those that do so more naturally or without conscious effort are deemed neurotypical."
"When I’m around people, I make myself act like them. I have a persona that is an amalgamation of everything that’s socially acceptable. I have to tone down or completely “mask” my reactions to things.

Since my intense and unfiltered reactions to some things are weird or annoying (I audibly gag at some textures and stim a lot physically), I hide them because people treat me differently when I’m not masking around them.

I’m able to be around close friends and family without hiding my neurodivergent traits, but with most people I suppress myself, and that takes so much effort."
"It's living in hell, all your life. It's pretending to be someone you're not in an attempt to survive and succeed, even if what you're doing goes against everything your body/mind is telling you to do.

Think of a neurotypical person and their typical social motions: looking people in the face, understanding social cues, being relatively comfortable with common things like going to the store or perhaps some other social gathering (let's not even get into large gatherings and tons of noise/lights/smells), understanding and being able to identify or regulate your emotions, not being highly sensitive to one or more primary senses (sound, temperature, light, odor, etc.).... the list goes on.

Now take those things and make it so the social norm is the exact opposite, and in order to survive or succeed you have to learn how to do these things, but you don't really learn them and understand them, it's more that you've memorized the steps to the dance and have practiced and practiced until you can get it right even though it's not genuine.

Now take that scenario and make the neurotypical world the default, and autists have to figure out hownto live in that world. That is autistic masking. It's pure hell every day and it causes a ton of depression, anxiety, and other things. Medicine can take the edge off, but that's it."
"ELI5: make an effort to appear normal.

It is masking your condition to blend with neurotypical people. It usually consumes a lot more resources than neurotypicals can imagine and causes a lot of mental fatigue"
"It is when someone who has autism has to act like they don't have autism, to fit in with people who don't have autism.

Often it is just societal bullshit, especially when the autism is merely mild autism, or ""high functioning"" autism. Society should simply accept those people as they are, instead of them feeling that they should have to mask.

Fuck most of society and fuck the people that cause people with autism to have to mask."

"Autistic guy here, ive known that people maso but i havent that much, whenever i mask, its because i dont want to be chastised at school, a public place, etc. Although recently ive been trying not to since i feel more free. Basically it comes down to this in the simplest terms
A ""defense mechanism"" that ensures you arent socially chastised and called out in public"
"I'm glad you explained that so well. I have friends that are going through some of the same things...it took a minute for me to catch on...getting close to someone that has autistic mannerisms, well you pick up on it if you really pay attention to them. I felt as if I was violating something private by asking but was relieved to find out that they were so open about it and relieved to have someone else they could be honest and really themselves with...one of my dearest friends..."
"Avoiding tasks and stuff that could possibly expose you -  and it makes it worse because I get a little a anxious and overwhelmed trying and doing new things and even though I have good intentions everything always , always go wrong.

I've always been the type to want to do something last, or do it alone in the middle of the night so no fear of judgement. I would wake up in the middle of the night to do my homework at like 2 or 3 am because I hated doing it in front of my family. My mom would try to help but never be able to answer the questions I had and it made me so upset that I would never truly understand anything I'm doing . (ADHD/possible)"
"As children, our behaviours are constantly corrected to be ""neurotypical"" behaviours - which really means, the behaviours that society has decided are acceptable and which come more naturally to people who are not autistic. 

We learn very quickly that only a neurotypical presentation is ""acceptable"" and if we want to stay out of trouble, make friends, get and keep jobs eventually, we have to pretend to be neurotypical.

Imagine being an actor, on stage all day long, constantly trying to remember the ""right"" lines, and facial expressions to make in every scene, constantly judging whether you got it right. That would be really exhausting wouldn't it?

And that is how we live when we mask. Permanently exhausted, and that's before you add on sensory stimulation and all the others things that eat away at our fabric.

I was diagnosed aged 43, and masking is still the most damaging thing I do to myself."
"Imagine a robot who looks just like a human. Now imagine them doing robot stuff. That's natural for them but wierd for you. 

Now imagine being a robot trying to pretend to be a human and blend in, it's not natural. They may get good at it and or they may be terrible at it, you might notice something off about them, but either way it's mentally exhausting and takes a toll on them to analyse and second-guess the correct way to move and behave.

This is just an analogy but I guess some autistic people won't be happy being called robots. Ive been called a terminator in the past but I'm not bothered by it."
"Could someone ELI5 how this differs (neurologically, and in other ways) from using social judgment? For example, I may feel an impulse to interrupt my colleague, but I make the decision not to; or I want to roll my eyes at something someone said, but I decide not to out of politeness. My burning truth may be that I still hate my colleague or want to roll my eyes, but I suppress it to keep the peace or to keep a strategic advantage. Is the NT/ND difference in how much energy or resources it requires to conceal these real reactions?"
"As someone who was diagnosed (technically with Aspergers) at 32, it was mind blowing to me when I found out that other people didn’t practice potential social interactions and conversations. Like how tf do you know what to say and how to act if you didn’t practice?!?"
It's exhausting.
"It’s funny, how at times I felt the same way - that everyone was like you and I, but better at it doing it. And later, as a teenager, how lonesome it was, like nobody else struggled like us, trying to act and “be” normal. 

I am so grateful that there is so much better awareness and understanding of it today, for the sake of our kids."
"I'm autistic and my work is in a related field.

FYI, there is no such thing as ""going non-verbal."" Non-verbal autistic people can express fewer than 20 words or signs to communicate at any time.

You're talking about shutdown and selected mutism during periods of overstimulation.

I see people saying ""I go non-verbal"" all the time, and it's taken on a colloquial meaning, but that's really to the detriment of people who are actually non-verbal, a much more serious symptom.

So, please make an effort to correct your terminology and encourage others to be more accurate."
"Huh, I've just learned I've been masking for nearly 40 years and didn't even know it.  It's gotten to the point that I don't even know who I really am anymore and I am just able to fit in with pretty much any group."
Who do you talk to for a diagnosis? This basically sums up how I’ve lived my life. Typically I like avoiding talking all together because I don’t want to make mistakes when it’s not a conversation I have practiced. And I don’t want to accidentally react wrong. It’s interesting to know that I’m not alone in doing this now though
"My daughter was recently diagnosed and it has made me think/realize I must have it as well. This describes my childhood as well: studying others to learn how to act, not getting it, not fitting in. Masking successfully later (in high school and college) but also experiencing burnout, hating my own brain and life in general, and drinking heavily because it turned off my brain and made social interactions much easier.

Im 35 and newly sober and still trying to figure it all out. Honestly I don’t know if I have ASD or just social anxiety or what but definitely something is going on. Something that's interesting to me is that this has gotten better for me as I've gotten older. I've been able to train myself and get more comfortable as I've grown and matured and gone through life experiences. I'm reading from others in this thread that that's not typical for ASD so really I don't know what to think."
"I'm late diagnosed myself.  Currently 51 and, after Covid everyone seems to have transformed into their literal social media personalities.  Everyone seems so hostile and quick to attack.  My previous scripts and research have to be completely redone.  It's really exhausting, especially at our age.  I just don't know if I want to put the time into it or just move somewhere else and completely isolate.  lol."
"burnout is real.  I've gotten to the point where I just don't want to be around other people anymore, ever."
"I have a permafrown because of all the concentration is takes. It worked out though, because I'm in my mid-sixties and my face is wrinkle-free, lol"
This is also a super useful skill for sociopaths and serial killers!
"Sounds traumatic, as commendable as that is"
"Fuck me, am I autistic? I’ve never watched anything to match facial expressions but have practiced in the mirror. Always have practiced any conversation and how to respond in my head."
"Otherwise known as socialization.

We're all wearing masks and uniforms, dude."

[Me in a nutshell.](https://imgur.com/a/tanRmcU)
So would a therapist be able to diagnose autism?
"Fuck me, I should probably see someone about a diagnosis, because this is sounding way too familiar"
"Everything you said here encapsulates me. I was diagnosed at 40. As soon as a situation didn't go according to plan, I got totally lost and struggled to function. The relief on diagnosis was very much my brain saying, ""My life and mental experiences make so much sense now.!"
"Dude, I feel your post.
And then you get real proud of yourself for seeming like a real person until you realise what you're actually thinking and it hits you; how screwed up that is that you don't think of yourself as a ""real person""."
"Oh hey it's me. The bottom half. I'm currently dealing with those issues, but trying to get away from the ganja and focusing my life. Although that doesnt help with the autism lol"
"This right here is one of the best answers of this thread and should really be the top comment. Masking is not unique to autism, but as you have done a great job describing, autistics have to mask certain differences related to the areas you described."
Sounds a lot like customer service roles in most jobs.
">Talking in ways that neurotypical people expect you to talk. Like saying ""how are you?"" when you don't actually care, feigning interest in people's hobbies and not just talking about your own interests, that kind of thing

Now I'm concerned there's a bunch of people thinking ""I might be autistic!"" when they're just arrogant, self-centered and rude."
"i do all of that and i couldnt explain it any better or at all actually lol

personally eye contact is the worst even with best friends (the only people I can look in the eyes comfortably are the people i genuinely love (my sister and my then-gf)), I become almost literally paralized, like all of sudden I was put inside some casting.

When it comes to facial expressions I usually just copy the other person or try act accordingly to the way they said something (its hard af when its a stranger tho)"
"\-I‘m bad at this. Luckily the phrase “resting bitch-face” came out, and I can usually get a laugh out of my coworkers if I use the right tone when I use it to excuse myself, but family photos are still a problem.

\-A big issue. I stop myself from pacing by sitting down, but I still need to move so I jiggle my leg. But my family doesn’t like it when I jiggle, because it rattles the couch, so I have to keep reminding myself or being reminded to sit still and it’s stressful.  

\-I have literal scripts that I go through, and if something comes up that I don’t have a script for, it’s like a computer crash.

\-I manage the eye contact thing with the old “look at their forehead, not their eyes” trick, but I’m still self-conscious and I keep wondering if I’m blinking enough or they’ll think I’m staring at them."
"I have a hard time understanding how this is much different than neurotypical people. I'm not autistic, but all of these (apart from eye contact) are very relatable and I know I'm not the only non-autistic person who experiences that."
I'm in this post and I don't like it.
BRB going to get tested.
im in these comments snd i dont like it
The trick is to think it’s sort of a mini-game and it becomes fun. Otherwise it is exhausting.
As someone with ADHD and something that causes me to have motor tics (mainly facial and much more prevalent when tired) I have spent 20 years masking my ADHD in public and around most people because “it’s not normal” to act the way my brain wants to. It is truly exhausting as you said. Most of my socks end up with holes in the toes because one thing I do is constantly curl my toes to take my brain off of “needing” to fidget/move.
"> Talking in ways that neurotypical people expect you to talk. Like saying ""how are you?"" when you don't actually care, feigning interest in people's hobbies and not just talking about your own interests, that kind of thing. 

To avoid a bunch of neurotypical people from self diagnosing, just because you do these as well doesn't mean you're autistic. ""How are you doing"" is a typical greeting that people just say even when they don't want an actual answer. ""Fine"" and ""good, how are you"" are the typical and expected answers. Not everyone is into the same hobbies and sometimes they just aren't interested in what someone else is talking about. Feigning interest is the polite thing to do."
Yeah I notice people are a little uncomfortable around me - and then I feel their uncomfortableness because I'm scanning their body language etc. Meds have helped in that regard and I usually start the convos to make less awkward. Though I am self medicated right now with nothing official 😆
It still blows my mind that there are people that don't practice/prep every conversation they expect to have and have never had to study and practice mimicking body language.
"It actually happens with a lot of mental health disorders such as depression, social anxiety, and PTSD. Masking is not unique to autism. What is unique for all of these is what they are masking."
"I used to talk to my dad about how I did much better at work when I mirrored other people’s emotions, movements and differences in speech such as cadence and direction. I made a personality for each person I dealt with. He said that was what he did so I figured everyone did that. 

This was a good solution when I was an engineer and didn’t really talk to people that much. Mostly just sat in a cube and coded. For reasons I switched into management and I couldn’t personalize for each person and had to build a consistent character. My mental health dropped immediately after getting promoted.  I was so exhausted after every meeting.

After years of this I’m going back into engineering."
Nailed it completely

Autism is when you like chocolate?
I don't have autism but I do have social anxiety and I do think of situations in my head of where I will need to say something.
Yeah. I was diagnosed at 53 and it was quite shocked myself. I was always amazed how other people could keep track of conversations when I’m a group. I’m ok one on one but as a few more people and I’m totally lost. I was always so jealous of people with social skills. I thought they must have practiced really hard.
"To be clear almost everyone practices some things,  job interviews,  asking out your crush,  asking your boss for a raise."
"Everybody masks sometimes. Nobody is their true authentic self all the time, that's impossible. And yes NTs absolutely do practice conversations.

The difference in autism is always the severity. Every ""problem"" an autistic person has can sound like a normal human problem when you isolate it. But it's the frequency, duration, and severity of these issues that are much higher with autism. 

Obviously this doesn't really address the idea of being wired differently as there are lots of different ways to look at autism. But I think it's important to remember that every person experiences some autistic traits some of the time.

I'm not downplaying anybody's personal struggle, my whole family is ND."
"I don't have an autism diagnosis, but I'm on a waiting list to get assessed. I'm 36 and when I started practicing social interactions (20s ish)  and preparing my intro for phone conversations, I suddenly got so much better at that stuff.

My spouse looked at me like I was an alien when I asked them if they do that too because they're so good at conversations and professional interactions. They were like ...no?"
"This reminds me of a situation the other day where I had to remind my wife how much I depend on pre-prepared reactions to social situations, in a situation where I absolutely did not read the room nor consider the implications of that very specific situation."
if it makes you feel better im 39 known i was autistic for about 3 years and im just finding this out :D
"Shit.

I thought that was normal."
"Thing is, A LOT of people who aren't on the spectrum don't know what to say or how to interact properly with others either. These are people usually referred to as ""rude"", ""lack tact"" or ""lack delicacy"", etc."
Oh I might be autistic
"I don't know if this is normal, but I sort of make up scenarios where I'm explaining something and practice that way, with whatever's on my mind at the moment."
"Heh, I've been there. The plus of that is that you become more conscious about yourself, while others that look like the most normal ones may be surprised in some situation and get angry, disoriented, emotional beyond their control.

The next step of ""rehearsing interactions"" is kinda fake it till you make it. After many of them, trying well and attitude of not being an asshole and actually aiming at being good human flow in interactions comes by itself."
Technically Asperger is still autism but this term was introduced by a  nazi scientist who wanted to distinguish between high and low “function ing “ autistic peeps
A good many of us do. We have social anxiety.
Have you seen the show The Rehearsal?
And it gets harder and more exhausting the older you get. You’d think it would get easier over time but for some reason it’s the opposite. My recovery days are starting to really ad up now.
I know that. You know that. But most other people don’t know that and it’s just easier to say than going in to a lengthy explanation of what it is that is actually happening.
"This could be code switching, which is when you behave and speak in certain ways around certain groups because that's how they respond best to you. This isn't unique to being neurodivergent, it's pretty common part of socialisation. If you don't have people you can 'switch off' around, you may feel like you lose your sense of self.

Masking is more about supressing or downplaying aspects of yourself to fit in. Like, forcing yourself to appear calm in situations where you are actually very uncomfortable, or stopping yourself from talking about certain topics because you don't want to come across as weird."
"Right there with you. 52 years old and I'm beginning to realize I don't know which parts of my behaviours are ""me"" and which parts are adaptations and masking."
You sound like my twin. Haha.
"Find a psychiatrist that specializes in autism spectrum disorder. It will involve a bunch of test and can take some time. And it can be expensive. I was lucky, or unlucky, enough to have had a complete breakdown that led to seeing a psychiatrist who made the connections and decided to administer the tests. I ended up not needing to pay."
"Autism is generally regarded as hereditary so it’s possible! The other thing is that you can be extroverted and enjoy people and still be autistic. 

Myself as an example: I’m great with people but part of my social fauxpaw struggles are that I do not understand boundaries of like what’s appropriate to say to whom. I happen to be really nice to people and compliment others regularly and this comes off as me being naive, nice, or two faced depending on who you ask and what they’ve been through. This behavior though isn’t commonly noticed as autism because I don’t come off as the stereotypical “rude” or “aloof”. 

So part of the social aspects of autism are also examined within a cultural lens. If you have someone who’s autistic but grew up in California or the south, they might be regarded as rude, but put them in New York City and they might fit in a little more in that aspect. Now that doesn’t mean autism suddenly vanishes when you enter a new region, it just means certain traits or behaviors are (especially socially) are going be highlighted more or less. The sensory aspects and brain structure and function don’t change. 

I hope this makes sense. I by no means am saying that someone is or isn’t autistic or that autism isn’t real. Just that cultural expectations can highlight or minimize certain social behaviors autists might exhibit."
"I think there’s more to it than that.

I don’t speak body language. I have learned that certain poses are supposed to mean certain things- I’ve basically pieced together a phrasebook. But I can’t really understand anyone else’s body language without consciously thinking about it. I think most people don’t do that.

I know eye contact is a big thing. The only information I’m getting when I make eye contact with somebody is what color their eyes are. I think other people are getting some more out of it than that. I try to make the right amount of eye contact during conversations, but i have to think about it."
Ah. There’s always one.
Getting a diagnosis doesn’t really change things. It validates your experiences and it helps you put a name to stuff. It also allows you to get some help accommodations from work or school. But it really doesn’t make things better.
"They aren't allowed to.  Each of the four I spoke with said the same thing: ""we definitely can't diagnose autism, but here's a list of people that can and you may enjoy reading this stack of literature about autism as well""."
As far as I am aware they cannot.
I fully understand the not going to plan part. I used to be a truck driver. It was good because I worked alone and there was a routine. But as soon as the routine was changed at the last minute I would become irrationally angry. One small change and I would fall apart. I never knew why I had those extreme reaction to change of routine. Now I do.
"and still you think that you are the right person to judge a policeofficer killing a 17 yo kid. 

Im sure you represent the average human regarding emotions, morals and general consideration of what is right and what is wrong."
"The term originates from autistic people, but plenty of people who aren't autistic do some thing similar, yes"
"Thanks for pointing that out. For a moment I was like ""Have I been autistic my whole life without knowing""."
A notoriously draining role
"Part of this is a matter of degree. Yes, we all have the experience of at times not wanting to say hello, or being worried that what we are really thinking or feeling is not the best or most appropriate for that situation but for autistics these problems are more highly prevalent and they may struggle with being able to adopt a facial expression that looks more genuine or typically struggle to truly understand the need or the why of social behaviors. A good example is a 45 year old man who told me it took him until he was 35 to realize that it is important to say thank you, not that he understood why, just that to other people it was important. Also please understand too that we are much better in the past 20 years in helping autistics with gaining this type of information so someone who doesn't ""look"" autistic may be masking. The best thing to do is if you think you have a problem ( and trust me you would get a fair amount of feedback from others if you did) then you should try to see a qualified mental health specialist."
The difference is that neurotypical people do this stuff naturally without having to really think about it. For autistic people it takes a lot of active effort to remind yourself to seem interested
"Same - I rehearse before every work conversation because it helps me feel more in control. Even the most benign ones. 

My manager told me once that I was a hard person to read and it made me feel awful because I feel like I really try to be expressive."
"I think a lot of people do it, autistic or not. I'm very good at talking with people and have no difficulty doing it (I did as a kid but then somehow everything changed when I hit high school), but I still mentally replicate situations and conversations over and over and over, I spend a lot of time overthinking and imagining what I would say in X setting. This leads me to being overcharged and basically a freight train of words, and also allowed me in the past to pretty easily handle being on a stage or talking to complete strangers without any preparation.

The gist is, a lot of people do it to some extent, it helps with improving your readiness for public situations and talks, whatever your baseline is. I still wouldn't say *it's a good thing*. Don't think that you should be like this if you are not. There pros and cons and I'm pretty sure overthinking and rumination cause me a lot of anxiety."
"Is the crowded room issue due to your mind trying to track all conversations at once?

That's what always trips me up. I can be in a conversation with the person right in front of me, desperately trying to concentrate on what they're saying, but my brain is got the clicker going, just cycling through every conversation in the room, like it's trying to find a show it wants to watch.  God forbid there's an actual television in my line of sight. 

Then I realize that the person in front of me has been speaking for however long, but I wasn't hearing them. So I have to scramble to try and remember what words I picked up from them while my brain was flipping through all the other conversations."
"Did you constantly hear ""could do better?"" as a kid?

""Could do better"" was the mainstay of all my school reports.

Except I couldn't do better. But still, to this day, I can't get out of that mindset... if only I'd done better!

Diagnosed at 43."
"All of those things are times when you want to make a good impression, so it makes sense to ""practice"". The difference seems to be that non-autism people don't need to ""practice"" regular social interaction such as with their friends."
"Do non-autistic people have ""set pieces""?  Specific bits of dialogue that you use in similar social situations, e. g. when speaking to other parents at a playground, or strangers on a bus?"
"That’s very similar to how that conversation went for me. 

I’m the same way, it’s hard for me to “argue” with my partner if I wasn’t ready for the conversation. She can just spin me in circles. She’s learned to give me a heads up for any difficult conversations. Makes them go much more smoothly for both of us."
"Lmao. I’ve lost count of the amount of times that I’ve said something that’s pissed off everybody and then had to have my girl explain to me why everybody was mad at me. 

I’ve gotten better and learned to not always say what I think. But I honestly can’t wrap my mind around how people get mad when all I did is say out loud exactly what just happened."
"Yes. My diagnosis is now “high functioning autism”. They don’t use Aspergers anymore in a clinical setting. But that’s a pretty recent change. 

Random side note: 

When I was first getting diagnosed, I didn’t understand the spectrum at all. I just kept getting angry and saying “I’M NOT RETARDED!” (She finally got me to agree to the test when she told me “I bet people tell you that you are a jerk or an asshole very often, and you can’t figure out why because all you did is explain what is happening”). 

When the therapist finally got me to take a few test and stop fighting her. She explained Aspergers to me in great detail for almost an hour. 

My response was “so I’m Autistic, but only the good parts?” She laughed her ass off for a good minute before telling me that was the most Asperger response she’s ever heard."
"I've seen people use that term in autistic forums and subreddits, where people should know. I'm not convinced that even they know that. I think it's a misconception the majority of people, autistic or not, have and that it should be corrected."
"Lol, at first I thought you were saying you had a twin with autism."
Shit sucks!
Thanks for the response! Hopefully my insurance will cover some of the costs
"Yeah, but in the end we're all on the spectrum to a certain degree. The point is to not make the human condition itself into one form or another of a disease.

(Left as the traditional exercise for the reader.)"
[deleted]
"I had a surprise visit from my mum and grandparents. It messed me up for days. I hadn't long been out of hospital and had just planned on relaxing on the sofa. Seeing them was obviously a better thing, my mind was blown that they were there."
"Yeah, that is one of the problems right now with everyone talking about masking and not having much information about it. It is hard because people don't know what is a common human experience, what is a common experience among different experience of different disorders, and what is more specific. I am glad we are now more open about our experiences but sometimes people go a bit overboard. The best thing to do honestly is if you are noticing something about yourself that you are concerned about is to try and talk to a professional and find one you feel comfortable being honest with."
"It wasn’t until this year (I’m 29) that I realized that when people are making conversation and asking me how things are going, what I do for work, etc., I should ask them questions back and I was probably seeming rude or self-centered all this time. But that’s just a bit of my obliviousness in some areas. As I said before, I’m not autistic. 

I think a lot of people are reading about a couple autism traits or some anecdotes from autistic people online and jumping to the conclusion that they have autism. It really takes a clinician with a holistic (meaning whole person and environment, not “holistic medicine”) approach to make an accurate diagnosis. People are tend to be pretty bad at accurate self-aware. 

Anyway, you probably know all these so I might just be preaching to choir. I just wanted to add that perspective for anyone else reading this."
"Its probably because your 'acting' rather than  letting your natural words and body language do its thing, overthinking essentially. Expressive people tend to go with the flow"
"It sucks they said that, but it may just be that THEY have a hard time reading you (maybe because they don't know well enough) and they are generalising. Keep at it, you're doing great !"
"Is this an autism thing? I've experienced this, not a great time."
"For me (diagnosed autistic) it's that I hear ALL THE SOUNDS at once, like having a hundred TVs all on different channels, so it can be almost impossible trying to filter out the one conversation I'm trying to pay attention to."
"I have an auditory processing disorder that manifests itself when trying to understand people when there is back ground noise, especially voices"
I have very few memories of my childhood. Almost none. But I do have stories from from when I was a child told to me. Similar to you. Could do better. Need to participate more. Doesn’t apply himself.
Exactly.  Just wanted to make sure a bunch of people didn't start diagnosing themselves because they've practiced a conversation a few times
"What if they can't anticipate well enough to practice, but seem to always either mess up in small ways they didn't realize they were doing but that turned out to actually be big ways, or else be worried about what little things they still haven't realized they're doing?"
"I think so but it depends on how long you mean. I know I have a couple funny stories that work in certain settings and certain topics I know make good responses to common topics (local sports,  weather,  etc)

But they aren't word for word or anything"
"""Schtick"", it's called"
"If you’re talking about “canned responses?” Yes and no. You could argue that small talk is largely canned questions and responses, with some variation. I think the difference lies in the degree at variation and response fluidity when it’s necessary to go “off script.” When switching to improv, so to speak.

I would imagine “off script”  improv mode is more difficult for those with autism?"
">it’s hard for me to “argue” with my partner if I wasn’t ready for the conversation.

Yuuuup. I'm a little better at it now (due to a lot of research and practice, lol classic) but I'm one of the world's worst arguers. If you give me your arguments on paper and send me off for few days, I can write you a beautiful rebuttal. But in the moment I'm just slack-jawed.

We've got better at communicating too. I joke (dark humour) that is a good thing my spouse isn't abusive because they could gaslight the shit out of me, it would be about a morning's work and I'd never have an independent thought again. On a serious note, it makes it so easy for me to see how autistic people suffer higher levels of domestic abuse. For a lot of us, it would be the easiest thing in the world to love-bomb us, then turn to emotional manipulation."
I connect with this HARD.
Neurodivergent power✊🏼
"Self diagnosis is mostly valid if you’re honest. There are some , however, that diagnose just to belong. It’s a weird dynamic."
"Not really concerned about anything. Lets say that I didn't enjoy talking with people as much. I'm fine with the Family and close friends circles, but outside of that I rarely care, so I just fake it."
"I believe it's a stimulus filtering issue, which is true of ASD and ADHD, afaik. 

Being unable to, or having to exert lots of mental energy to focus on a single conversation, and usually only being sort of successful.

Sometimes having all the conversations and noise in a room come thundering into your brain at once. 

Before I took my diagnosis seriously, I just thought I was an introverted extrovert. In short bursts, I enjoy socializing even in groups.

I didn't realize that I was so drained afterwards because of all the additional mental strain to listen, to filter sounds, then generally to bullshit to cover up how much I missed while my mind was being overwhelmed by stimulus. Even the times that the din was so loud in my head that I wanted to cover my ears, I'd just ride that out and keep nodding and smiling. 

After a big group thing, I'd often take days or even weeks where I minimized contact with others, to recharge. 

Full disclosure: I'm not a doctor, and I've never been formally diagnosed with ASD. I have been diagnosed many times as ADHD (ADD at the time, so ADHD-I by the current definition.)"
Yeah there’s a big issue online these days of people naming something that is quite common and attaching it to autism or adhd
"I don't mean stories, I mean pre-set answers (words, gestures, and inflections) to all expected questions like ""how was your vacation"" or ""what do you do"" or ""have you lived in Ruritania long?"""
"It is, but if one has enough canned responses it's almost never necessary.  Kind of like playing chess - at first you have to improvise in response to every move the opponent makes, but after a few thousand games read and analyzed you know that it's an  X attack and you simply respond with a Y defence."
Yes. People with autism need to watch out for narcissists. They’ll spin you in circles and you won’t be able to “justify” any of your (valid) emotions because you just can’t keep up with the conversation
"I'm kind of going through the process now. I'd figured I have ADHD and reached out for a diagnosis on that.

And not that it can't be both, but after talking to me, the psychiatrist thought ASD was a strong possibility and I've had to reach out to people specializing in this for another test (not taken yet)

This was something I'd experienced a few times and it took on a different context in light of the possibility of ASD."
"It’s something else to learn how to do that kind of filtering with active cognition that doesn’t overload the brain. 

What’s funny to me is that basically we’re getting minimally to unfiltered data straight to our brains. 

In a conversation with a professor of neuropsychopharmacology, I inquired what it would be if one altered how they process their sensory perceptions consciously and conscientiously rather than unconsciously and uncontrollably in the case of hallucinations, be they organic (due to brain or body issue) or chemically induced.

“That just sounds like normal filtering ability to me,” was his answer.

Wild how this scientific answer syncs with a Buddhist caution to not fully trust one’s own senses unless one is an arhat, bodhisattva or buddha, basically all the sentient beings who have experienced enlightenment."
"Yup, according to the CDC about 1.5% of males in the US are autistic. According to the people on some social media sites that number is around 65%. I’m half joking and no way this is meant to offend those that are actually diagnosed on the spectrum…..it’s all the “self diagnosed”"
"This is SUCH a great example and explanation, thank you - I’m not autistic but I have friends and family who are, and this is a brilliant concrete example of different ways to handle those types of social interaction."
"No not really. The only thing I can think of like that is if I'm walking my dog and we pass another dog walker I've got a few things I have preloaded to easily explain to other dog people my dog is nice,  but she's big and loud and if your dog gets nervous she'll get weird, so it might be best to keep your distance if your dog doesn't want to meet or you don't have time to. But there's a very specific reason that I've tried to boil that down to a phrase or two"
"I think that’s actually an excellent analogy. For most people, this happens passively and unconsciously over time. With autism, perhaps it’s more of an active and conscious process.

Similar to stimulus filtering but instead it’s response selection."
"I hope it goes well for you.  I have found it life changing to learn these things about myself, and to know where I'm different. Not because it really fixes any of the symptoms, but rather it helps me figure out if I can learn to cope, or at least learn to accept these things.

I still feel like an alien at times, but knowing definitely helps me accept it, to be at peace with who I am."
"Our brains are us. And our brains have no direct sensory capability, so everything we perceive is abstracted at least one layer out.  Plato's cave where our brains are trying to figure out the world but can only use the shadows cast on a cave wall.

Having done some experimentation myself, both with coping mechanisms for sensory issues, and tripping balls, I'm constantly amazed at the malleability of our perceptions."
Humans have been asking the same questions for all of our existence. Sometimes it’s just a difference in the language used to express the answer.
"misinformation is so rampant because of them these days. i had someone genuinely tell me that *blinking while you sneeze* is an autistic trait.

i also saw an instagram post where they said “autism makes me better in social situations, and if your afab it might do the same to you!” like??? i can understand picking up on small details with people you know (maybe someone clicks their fingers slightly before they get mad etc) but a major part of the disability is it’s impairment on social situations? wtaf are these people going on about"
Get stoned and watch the NOVA specials on the brain you’ll love it even if you’re already aware of the stuff.
"While I enjoy studying religion as philosophy as well as philosophy, I really am blown away by the places where science has caught up with ancient wisdom."
"Wow, people never cease to baffle. Thanks for sharing"
"LMAO

*blinking while sneezing* well we’re all autistic then I guess."
"It’s kind of reminiscent to “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Philosophy (and religion viewed through the lens of philosophy) developed through pure logic. We could only examine the mind.

But now we have the technology to examine the physical brain in process, and assign modern technical language to theories that far predate modern technology.

So now the hard science is starting to coincide with the soft science in areas."
Had a guy telling me that carbohydrates aren’t needed in a healthy diet and you should have zero carbohydrate intake. He got mad when I warned him he should probably be avoiding vegetables…
"Eh, a lot of people refer to extreme low carb diets as ""no-carb"", which it isn't really, but I can understand how someone might make that mistake if they are just following some basic rules and haven't really studied the matter much."
"Oh a lot of it boils down to a poor understanding of what a “carb” is. If I were being polite, I’d say they were failing to distinguish between carbohydrates generally and sugars specifically. Let alone nuances between refined/added sugars versus “natural” sugars. We’ll just leave glycemic index and glycemic load alone altogether."
Lonely. I’ve personally been happier for unmasking but I’ve come to the conclusion that others need me to mask or they just don’t like me.
It’s very difficult. I don’t know what is the mask and what is me and what is the mental illness I’ve acquired along the way (late diagnosed). I’m lost with it tbh.
My mom told me she absolutely hates who I’ve become and wishes the old me would come back. I don’t have energy to go back to that
"Not good. I have had to mask so thoroughly and from such a young age, using a number of different masks, that I don't know who the hell I actually am. I'm not sure the real me can even speak."
"People don’t want to talk to me. People don’t want to get to know me. At all. 
Maybe it’s because of the way Ive learned to circumvent social situations but I ask people a lot of questions about themselves. 
People don’t ask me questions about myself or my life, not even those closest to me. If I try to talk about something I’m interested in or tell a story then I’m ignored. It’s like I don’t exist unless I’m enabling them to talk about themselves ."
"Diagnosed adhd, heavily suspected autism.

I'm still finding my through this so take with a grain of salt, but it's come with identity crisis. Obviously I'm still the same person but there has be so much people pleasing and internalized ableism that I'm unsure just how much I do for other people.

I mean I find myself acting out that I'm more confused than I am about something so it obviously reads to others. It's just like who am I performing for? Do I really need whatever validation that brings me?

Also I don't know who to present to people anymore. I try to be honest but Living My Truth ™ now looks different than when I started listening to all the ""tiny"" things making me wince internally that I've suppressed due to parents punishing me into being more normal. Guilt for needing music and gloves to do dishes, a mask to clean cat litter, etc.

My biggest fear is that I'm deluding myself into something I don't have just because I've been so involved with information about it. Because there's like no information unless you seek it or luck into already having that community in your life to have examples.

But I do wince when I scrub the cutting board if it has groove and I'm losing my mind each year at a job and quitting because it's quitting the job or my life... So somethings up.

I don't claim to represent those diagnosed with a more clear status but this is my pov trying to get it sorted for multiple years dissolving all the shitty biases I was raised with"
Any personal experiences with unmasking yield negative results. For context: I live an area where something as simple as my flat affect and monotone means I'm barely tolerated even when masking.
"He're a life hack for people.

Date and make friends with people from other countries. They won't notice all your little oddities like an American would.

I am dating a woman who moved from China 20 years ago and she thinks I'm so cute and adorable and loves my little quirks. She does not have all the societal training in America to see me as odd.

So there you go, unmask yourself and find foreigners."
"As a 34-year old undiagnosed female who only recently realized I am highly likely to be autistic, I always thought masking was something everyone did to an extent. For a long time I didn’t realize people actually looked each other in the eyes when talking, for example. I had naturally started looking at peoples’ noses to appear normal without really thinking about it.

I don’t think of myself as very odd, but I am often told I am some variation of quirky/eccentric/unique when I am being my most authentic. I still have trouble with impulsively sharing all of my thoughts without thinking it through or considering my audience. I am very candid and honest (often to my own detriment), and assume that others are the same. 

I didn’t realize for a long time that most humans do not talk about their problems or highlight their failings, while I am extremely open about mine when I am being myself. However, this often makes me feel different and contributes to unhelpful mental comparisons I make.

I honestly think some level of masking is necessary for autistic individuals to fit into our current society, but at the same time it can cause a lot of pain and a feeling of otherness for me. 

In my eyes, it comes down to three options, all of which suck:

A) Be 100% you, in turn rubbing people the wrong way and alienating others  
B) Mask for a majority of your life to please others, yet feel like you are never your authentic self  
C) An exhausting back-and-forth combo of A & B."
"Exhausted

I haven't realized how heavily masked I've been until I started taking it all off.... Now I feel exhausted from having had all that on for so long. 😓"
"I notice a lot of us think unmasking means denying accountability for our actions and blaming autism for behavior that 'people don't like'.   
In my observation most us struggle with being very self-involved to the point where we don't listen to people or feel that we can process the emotions that come from authentic relating.   
As I learn to relax my masks, I relax over-all.  Contemplative practices helps calm the nervous system, including cold showers and physical exertion. Unmasking is more about knowing my limits and letting people know ahead of time. Yes, it's still difficult."
"Diagnosed with autism at age 17 and diagnosed much younger with innatentive ADHD, depression, and anxiety. I didn't really understand what being autistic meant for me until I was 23 years old and started learning more about it. I also learned at that age that I have an information processing delay that affects my ability to learn things.

Masking for me was more for survival than anything else. I masked at work and I just kept to myself at school and hoped to not become a victim of bullying again (bullied in elementary and middle school but just an outcast in high school). I learned at age 20 that coworkers can't be trusted and that it's risky making friends at work and trusting people at work (I have C-PTSD and I was a victim of stalking and harassment in the workplace).

Masking for me is being more engaged socially than normal (the real me is a hermit crab) and trying my best to appear sweet, warm, and welcoming. Especially when volunteering or at work (volunteering with the elderly and working front-desk at an assisted living/memory care facility part-time). I used to have to work more and mask more due to not having been on SSDI and parent's expectations of me.

Now I'm on SSDI I don't have to worry so much about money and I have medical insurance through Medicare. The main concern for my parents was whether I would be able to work enough hours to qualify for medical insurance through an employer or not and now that isn't a concern so their expectations of me are lower and much more reasonable.

That being said I do not feel completely comfortable unmasking at home. I've suffered from years of covert narcissistic emotional/mental abuse from my mother and my spineless father goes along with her to avoid being a victim himself. Ideally I would move out on my own but financially I can't afford to do so so I'm trapped. Usually there is a calm before the storm so I try to be as good of a daughter as possible and the least autistic/depressed/chronically ill I can be to avoid my mother's emotional/mental abuse.

So my experience hasn't been great. I stim alone in my room to avoid judgment from others, I struggle to set reasonable boundaries with family and enforce those boundaries, I'm codependent of my parents due to their emotional abuse/neglect, and I oftentimes feel like I'm having to be careful of not upsetting the fragile balance of agreeing to do too much because not agreeing to attend social events would cause my mother to be abusive and having no social battery the next day or saying no and hoping it doesn't upset her.

Just so everyone knows I do see a wonderful therapist, I am on antidepressants, and I do try my best to take care of myself and my needs instead of just always being a people-pleaser. Of course, neither of my parents will agree to go to therapy (their insurance covers it fully and they have plenty of options cause I used to be on their insurance and get therapy through it) and when I suggest it they take it to mean that I hate them and that they are horrible human beings. So I just avoid the subject matter entirely."
"Either you stop and lose the majority of your friends and possibly family (depending on how understanding they are), or you keep masking, and be accepted. I guess you could do it somewhere in between, but I was miserable, like walking on eggshells miserable.

Even though I don’t have many people now, the people I do have accept me for me, as I do with them. All in all, I’ve never been happier, even with the hiccups I still have from the past."
"I still struggle with this because it was bullied into me. When it comes off it's because burnout has torn it off.

It's been three years since my diagnosis and last year it finally clicked, if that makes sense. Takes me a long time to properly process shit.

So hopefully there's some good advice here. I need it too, bc I've developed a cycle of burnout and meltdown, and I know I'm not alone in this. Need the wisdom of the autist elder sages."
"Well, I’m pretty sure my journey to unmasking helped speed up my soon to be ex husband not wanting to be with me anymore. 😂 
I just started to look within myself and realize I didn’t…have to mask? I’m an adult and if doing something makes me happy and my day to day life easier, I’m going to do it. I started getting way more outspoken, calling out things that he was doing/saying that weren’t conducive for any of the parties involved. Generally just started advocating for myself/our kids, and he didn’t like it. 
All in all, I’m happier and more confident in doing things on my own. Just wish I could stop taking everything literally, as someone who’s sarcastic as fuck, I have a hard time pin pointing when someone else is being sarcastic 😂"

no matter how hard id try- people still find me “wierd”
"Late diagnosed AudHD. As I unmask...it's a beautiful journey. Life feels sweeter. The things I love about unmasked me; other people love as well. It surrounds me with people who love me for me, and that's a breath of fresh air to say the least. Yesterday was my birthday, and I went out with my boyfriend. I did my happy dance when I ate something I loved, and the server said ""I love the happy food dance. That's always a good sign!"". My boyfriend giggled endearingly at my stims and excitement. I could see him love me in his whole being. He didn't react poorly when I said thank you to the gifts in my natural monotone blank face way. He knew I was being genuine despite my tone of voice and expression. He didn't get frustrated or invade my space when I unwrapped my present by not tearing the paper at all lol. He smiled. I even had friends at the restaurant write ""Happy Birthday!"" And ""congrats on you autism you bendy f*ck"". (I got my autism diagnosed on Dec 5th, and I also have Elhers Danlos syndrome hence the ""bendy f*ck"" part of it. I worked as a chef before becoming disabled so they are restaurant industry friends). They all laughed with me, and we had a great time. They smiled lovingly at me when I did happy hand flaps. They were so kind when I couldn't decide on what I wanted to eat or drink, and took forever to pick cuz ADHD and tangent conversations. It felt so nice to be myself. I can put on noise cancelling headphones and take social breaks without any issue or question. I'm still insanely kind and empathetic. That's not going anywhere. I do find myself questioning what's me, what's a good learned behavior vs an unhealthy one, what's a mask and what's not, what is reasonable to feel/do, what is from trauma, how to communicate better, when to take a break...lots of things.... But it's so so lovely learning. Most of my friends are neurodivergent, so most often I'm met with understanding and support. I felt like I was being a rigid jerk recently, but many people reassured me I wasn't and that it was okay to just have my preferences. I'm very intelligent, and I know it's often viewed as egotistical/bad to say so. However it feels isolating and my friends are helping me see that I'm not a jerk for finally realizing I have a high IQ; that it's okay to prefer to be around people I can easily identify with. For so long I've worked to find my place around/with people I don't prefer because I feel like I need to work on myself to get along with and communicate better with others (especially cuz I think ""there's nothing wrong with them, and they're great people. I should work on me instead."").  I'm learning where to set my boundaries, and spend my energy. Trying hard to unmask and find a balance of meeting my needs, and simultaneously understanding where my place is in this world. I want to always be kind. I want to always be working on improving myself, and communicating better. That doesn't mean I can't unmask, or that unmasked me will suffer. It doesn't mean that unmasking will be easy. But to me it's so worth it! I love it so so much! 🥰
I never respond to pain like an NT...I often don't react at all and that's been hard on my physical health journey. It hurts me. I learned to mask to act like an NT for my doctors, so I could get the help I need. Now that they know I'm autistic I can tell them that, and let them know that I react differently to pain. I can unmask and communicate exactly what's happening. That's huge for me! I'm already happier, calmer, more accommodated, kinder, etc. I can't wait to keep learning, growing, and finding myself. Heal!"
"I don't unmask unless I'm completely exhausted / alone. Society has narrow expectations of a middle aged male with a full time job and if I want my life to not fall apart I have to play the game. I am virtually indistinguishable from my ""mask"" at this point because the only being who has seen me not doing it is my dog."
"To work through the mask, I have to work through the trauma that lead me to mask in the first place. Have to deal with a lot of shame and trying to reframe things."
"Tough. I feel like I’ve barely got anywhere, and have mostly come to the conclusion that if you want to hold down a job then you have to mask because society isn’t made for us."
I can’t. At least not around other people.
"It's been slow going, and I've been doing it carefully as I definitely cannot unmask fully at work and such. 

I've been stimming more and caring less in public. I would always look at people on the sidewalk to subconsciously see if they disapprove of what I'm doing. I don't care anymore and I've been doing my best to not look at them. I'll do some stims now in public and it's been really nice actually. Just some movements and mouthing words to songs while walking down the street, nothing that is actually disruptive.

At work I got permission to wear my noise canceling headphones at all times, so I do. Nobody has really cared since I can press a button to hear just as well as not wearing them. And it makes work so much more tolerable for me. I've also brought a couple stim toys to use."
"Well, diagnosed as a child, now 30 years old:
Masking is not an all or nothing thing, I have learned to modulate it through out my life as my needs change and copious use of coping mechanisms (like stim-toys, alone time, setting expectations and boundaries etc) help me keep up with it even though sometimes when life is really rough I still get shutdowns and meltdowns, but I don't think those are fully due to the masking I put myself through.
The thing that made me go with this approach was realising that relationships are only half about myself and the worthwhile ones (where you listen and are listened to) require you to put in some effort and that could mean some light masking to be counscious of peoples expectations if they are important to you.
Another important part of this whole thing for me was also learning when its safe to unsmask. Which means that when the social situation has no steaks that I care about I will simply not bother masking. I will be my fully autistic self most of the day because 90% of the people you meet while living in a city won't even remember your face, those interactions are almost always low stakes, so safe to unmask. That makes it easier to cope when it is important to mask.

If you work people facing jobs or don't have my luck of being a person that can WFH 2 times a week I understand that it can be really tough for the same reason that it is important to mask: many of my autistic affects read as weird/dangerous, it's a bit more true to me since I'm a huge kinda-fat dude (189cm) that does not present very friendly, so society kinda requires the masking for jobs and shit like that but for me it's been all about how I can cope and still maintain a social life and hold a job I'm happy with, hope I can keep doing it for a bit longer without burning out!

Wish OP and other commenters the best of luck on their unmasking journey."
"once you get authentic about who YOU are, others who like you start to be attracted to you, just the same way you are to them ... finally you get to have friends :)"
"I can't stop. Everyone insists my social skills have gotten worse over the last six years because I stopped masking as much. Nobody wants me to be me, they want me to be the me they think is the real one because they can't see it's the lie."
"Unfortunately, unmasked me is very angry and bitter and unpleasant to be around, and it makes everyone I interact with very uncomfortable and intimidated. It really is for the best that I continue masking whenever possible."
"I know how I used to be (when masking) but I just can’t figure out how to do that any more — like, it just doesn’t compute. I’m angry, I’m tired. I’m always losing jobs or friends. Part of it is mental health, part is being honest and unmasked. Wish I never stopped masking tbh."
"Realized after unmasking that I should have kept it on. Not for myself, but as a communication tool. With it off, people just straight don't get it, even if they try."
"Oof, patience with myself? I learned I was on the spectrum a year ago at age 40 (female). In retrospect I see how the mask had been slipping for a bit but it was like it just fell OFF. It’s been a real struggle controlling what comes out of my mouth.

This may not be the case for you, but I had a ton of anger when I learned I was essentially “scared” into creating this fake personality and holding all this stuff in for years, so I almost didn’t care about people accepting the “real me.” But I’d go back and forth about it. The pendulum is still swinging a little but less wildly - I’m closer to balancing being able to act like ME most of the time with not just being an asshole and expecting everyone to tolerate because I’m autistic. 🤍"
"Very frustrating but rewarding.  I've been more comfortable on average by a significant degree and my burnouts have been lasting much shorter, but most everyone has been noticeably annoyed by who I actually am.  It's unsurprising that my mother has had a hard time dealing with it since she's the main reason I started masking as a child, but I find that people in general have a notion of how things work and when you tell them that it bothers you or that you are uncomfortable with something that most people are fine with, they get defensive.  It has also led me to realize just how uncomfortable the world as a whole makes me which is something that sucks and there's never going to be a good fix for it.  All in all, I'm glad that I learned that the thing holding me back most in life was the drain that heavily masking was putting on me, but I really wish that it had been something with a better solution.

Side note, I was fortunate enough that when finding out I was autistic, I find out that most of my long term friends were as well.  A few of them thought I already knew so when I stopped masking they thought that I had just gotten more comfortable around them.  It was nice finding out that nearly my whole long term friend group was on the spectrum as well because it gave me some confidence that they weren't just tolerating me which is an insecurity that I've had with everyone my entire life."
You can never truly stop
I didn't learn how to stop it. I kind of forgot how during the pandemic. Mixed with familial stress since the pandemic & trying to be a better role model for my daughter. She has the right to grow up in a world I wished I grew up in. She can stim and be herself or whatever.
I do not even know when I'm masking. I'm either super hyper or super chill.
Not being around people a lot
it’s extremely hard to. but once i have in different situations i’ve been told i’m now a ‘different person’. so i stay masking 90% of the time. it’s exhausting. which is why i’m currently in burnout.
"I haven't been able to figure out how to not do it.  I never knew I was doing it in the first place, so I don't even know, necessarily, what it is that I'm doing.  I can unmask pretty well when I am alone at home, for the most part (I think), but no matter what I do, I only know how to be ""public me"" when I leave the house.  And it's so exhausting.  It's turning me into something of a shut-in, I'm afraid, because I get so tired going out and dealing with other people that I don't go out unless I need to now.  I was ""fine"" until I hit burnout, and now I'm starting to wonder if I'm ever going to be able to get back to the level of functioning in a workplace that I was at before.  And I'm struggling to find work I can do from home that will cover the bills."
"I just simply quit wearing the mask, I pull back the curtains and become what's underneath, But then I develop a sort of exoskeleton another layer the thick skin starts to become the mask all over again."
Not having enough alone time to unmask. Sometimes I don’t feel well enough to mask so I don’t. And I’m okay with that but not having to be conscious of it is best.
"The only way I felt comfortable doing it was probably not the way anyone would condone or recommend. 

I hated the idea of navigating all the relationships I had through unmasking, I’d tried to be myself here and there in the past but was also trying to maintain relationships at the same time and that felt like trying to pour water into a straw.

When I wasn’t going with the flow of everyone else, people seemed to either want to attempt to nonchalantly dissect me with seemingly unrelated questions or just overtly try to usher me in the direction they wanted me to go. 

Being like that, I realized that I sacrificed a lot of my boundaries and inadvertently let a lot of people into my life that I shouldn’t have.

Unfortunately, the want to address it wasn’t enough to get a good bead on the who’s who of it all because I’d gotten so used to burying how I felt in each moment to make it easier to *live* in those movements. I just didn’t know who was good for me and who wasn’t. 

So I kinda decided to throw the baby out with the bath water. Not my proudest moment but I made sure not to intentionally burn any bridges, I just wasn’t going to favor anyone more than common decency I’d give to a stranger, to ensure I could go through with it completely without the risk of one person coercing me into wearing the mask to reassure them I was “still me”. 

I distanced myself from everyone I knew and stopped giving people openings or being particularly friendly. I thought about changing my number too but I instead just removed the group chat functionality and stopped replying or answering unless I actually had something I *wanted* to say.(While keeping in-mind the “if you don’t have anything nice to say…” saying, I mainly just stopped acting on the worry of how others might perceive my response, or lack there of)

I wanted to prevent situations where even new people might feel inclined to take a step into my life, like a fence neighbor or some new coworker that wants an after-work buddy. I stopped sharing my interests and hobbies with people at work and kept conversations short and to the point. When the point was done, I stoped giving my attentions.

It took a while but at some point I had finally and thoroughly replaced the masked version of me that people may have had in their heads with someone else, someone more cold and uncaring. Not someone mean, just indifferent. That was probably as much of a mask of its own to be honest. But it was an *enabling one* rather than one that boxed me into a corner. 

It was a set-stage that allowed me to then be whomever I felt like being without issue. Who’s going to be upset and pushback when I suddenly have *more interest* in their life or what they have to say, you know. I set the baseline low enough that I was confident the unmasking was going to be well-received and therefore my brain was going to be rewarded for doing it. It seemed to work out that way in the end. 

When I run into people I know, or used to know, I just act the way I act and say what’s on my mind, accept or decline invitations and theres no more of that, “oh, come on, why not”, “it’s just this little thing”, “you used to ___” ,”what’s wrong” , “you just need to be around some people, *yada yada*.” Maybe it’s because the relationship is severally diminished but I’m not okay with the relationship’s strength being reliant on me masking so that’s a sacrifice I made with this choice. 

There likely exists a “healthy” path, most definitely a “healthier” one for relationships where you work through the conflicts and communicate the adjustments and boundaries with everyone you care about. But I honestly think I’d still be struggling with, or given up on, that path of trying to force myself to steady my had and pour water down the straw. Maybe I’m an asshole for not trying to explore *more* ways or not trusting the people close to me. Maybe a professional would have been able to steer me down a long healthy path of improvement and I just dug a deeper hole, I accept that, I knew it when I did it that It was selfish and in the end, I feel more stable and my boundaries are intact. Like the feeling of finally getting a job that can pay all your bills. Not everything is solved and I still have issues and complaints, but things are just…better. 

But like I said, I don’t think many would recommend my method and I won’t say I recommend it myself. It might not be the tactical nuke of unmasking, but it’s probably a cluster bomb solution, it comes with a pretty heavy prerequisite of being extremely independent already, financially and otherwise, else you risk screwing up your support structure."
"Live / worked in a major global capital until my late 20s, I had a gold medal in masking. Eventually I moved overseas to a place where I knew no one and the process of unmasking happened for a number of reasons but I guess the most important reasons is that I felt safe. There has been some luck involved, some hard work but I am now in a better position to be my true self and retain friends in a more sustainable/ harmonious manner"
"My unmasking as been purely involuntary. After (what I now realise was my last massive burnout and breakdown) Last year. The mask as been slipping and slipping which is what led me to go get assessed for autism and adhd. Up untill recently i was a MASSIVE people pleaser/fawner. But now I've started to say no to things and trying to put boundaries up for the 1st Time which is good ig. My stimming involves alot of sounds and random words, pacing and sometimes whacking my arms around. And rocking.  Atm there isn't many people to notice as I'm agoraphobic, but the person I live with is noticing more and I get wierd looks, and asked what am I doing and why. Which makes me feel like i need to push it back in.  But it's really hard and exhausting to do. I've found that im more blunt and say what I'm thinking, which as caused arguments.
I had a pretty awful public shutdown couple weeks, person I live with just didn't understand or give me space and kept going on and on at me and telling me to stop rocking. And I eventually screamed and swore at him.
I know I will have to get my own place as living with someone who doesn't understand and doesn't want to understand isn't going to go well. And the house can be so chaotic and noisy especially when he as his kids come visit. I know I need to get help to leave. Which is terrifying as I've never been independent.

I've only got 2 friends left in my life and Ig I am curious as to how they will react  when i am able to see them. I have told them  about how I will maybe be  different.  But If they don't like it then nothing I can do, I promised my self a year ago to try and do what's best for me, and make my self the main character of my own story/life. Because I've always sorta been just an audience member. 
Unfortunately I will always have to mask a little as if I didn't I wouldn't be able to speak to people at all. 

Sorry for going on. 
Tldr; involuntary unmasking, realising I need my own place, unsure so far about most people's reactions as agoraphobic."
"I find myself in more neurodiverse spaces because more autistic/adhd folks tend to gravitate towards me more (more than before). So more friendships that lead to more experiences that are positive. This also means cutting ties with certain people that I knew were unhealthy even when I was masking. 
More learning how to get used to being misunderstood/judged/talked down to. This has always been hard, but now unmasking will teach me how to get comfortable with it (if ever possible). 
Another hard one: I realize my tolerance for BS and “fakeness” is getting thinner. This can also be due to being in my 30s. But I realize that I’m much more sensitive to insincerity, especially if there’s an agenda or malice behind it. Or just social situations just seem inauthentic. I feel more anxious and angrier than i used to get. Also I’m more blunt/assertive/direct and understand that my gender and race are factors in how people react to it (I’m a black woman) but I also expect the same level of directness and honesty and need to realize that not everyone works that way. It’s especially hard in work environments where social situations can be performative and it’s triggering around subjects related to trauma."
"I haven’t stopped doing it yet because I feel like all my life people have been expecting me to mask, because my unmasked self is simply wrong. I know that I “need to be myself” and that if I do “at least people will like me for who I truly am”. But at 30 yo, I have no idea how to do that. I just don’t. I am exhausted."
That it fucking hurts.
"It’s a conundrum. I feel more authentic unmasking but I feel that people perceive me to be more “weird” and unfortunately I feel really sad about that. At the very least, I’m glad there are a few people who like me as I am. Few are far between but precious to me."
"Unmasking has been different than I expected. I thought about it abstractly, like “ I will start rocking again and let my vocal stims come out”. But more significantly, I am beginning to feel the reemergence of my childhood self, as in five years old; highly sensitive, fragile, nervous, delicate, and just feel very exposed and unsafe. It’s been a year and I know I’m just beginning to unmask and heal. Anyone experiencing this?"
"I highly recommend the book Unmasking Autism by Dr. Devon Price (who is also autistic). My experience with unmasking has been mostly positive. I think there is a lot of benefit in it, even if others are less comfortable when we don’t mask to the same extent."
I think I realized that not masking doesn't really bother people that much. One of my main stims is humming and I used to never do it in front of people but now I do it all the time at work. Rocking back and forth is another. For the longest time I convinced myself it was weird but then I realized it's actually pretty normal and lots of people do it for comfort.
"People started to consider me mean, impolite"
"I don't really know how to explain it, might be able to answer questions. I just... Started doing it, and now it's been like 2 years and i see progress. I no longer force myself to do things i'm not comfortable with. Sometimes i do put the mask back on for social situations but i know that it's the real me deep down and I'm not being forced into anything. The truth is, though, I am social and i like cracking jokes in certain situations. My ability to handle a lot of social in a day is absolute piss poor, but if i can laugh and talk fast and pun around for ten minutes i'm comfortable."
Lost my spouse by unmasking but starting to love myself again.
"I’m going through unmasking and in some ways it’s worse now. I’ve heavily masked to the point of convince myself that I’m fine and don’t have social anxiety etc. 

Now that I’m being more authentic to myself, and honest with other people about who I am, I feel much better and certain things are easier now that people understand me better. For instance, I used to make excuses for declining parties and I was running out of ways to get out of large social gatherings. Now I can just say ‘no thanks, it’s too many people for me, but I’ll come to the next event when it’s a smaller group’. 

However, now that I’m more honest with myself, I’m more anxious than before because I’m allowing myself to feel my anxiety, understand it and label it."
"Why would I stop? Everyone has proved that they can’t be trusted. Any time I’ve unmasked, I’ve felt ashamed and miserable. I always mask to some degree."
"Honestly I regret every time I stop masking. I feel unpleasant and I can sense people get uncomfortable. I can only do it with my therapist, 'cause when I try to be spontaneous with someone else there's a lot of bad consequences. I either become an inside joke or a burden."
"That is my experience. At home. With friends. At work etc. it’s all the same. I try not to let it get to me but it’s hard sometimes when people just use any excuse to make you the problem rather than taking a beat and being more understanding.

Edited to clarify: there are things that I don’t get socially unless it’s pointed out and the person is willing to talk and help me understand. These people tend to not exist in my office. It’s better at home and with friends, but it’s still work trying to deprogram whatever crazy “normal” expectations people have of me."
"thank you for this comment,  everyone worries about me now,  i stopped playing the game of being the comedian and everyone is concerned about my mental health.  i have not felt better actually,  i feel my soul healing and my focus is more on being a better person who helps others with action. 

 i now volunteer at food pantry, soup kitchens and help with charities like for clean water,  animal shelters and orphanage.  i do not understand why so fee people participate in these activities, its a better use of time than sitting home and watching tv or shopping outfits.  i am confused more and more about taught priorities of people."
And that’s precisely why I’m so terrified to unmask. Being a people pleaser sucks.
Sometimes I make involuntary sound effects. I've seen some disgust and disappointment. Every now and again I meet someone who I don't bother. I love those people.
What is it they don't like?
I feel this.
"The word autism does come from a Greek word meaning ""auto"", as in we are better alone than with others..."
Facts facts facts
"it feels like so many of these ""i wanna unmask"" posts are about people that just want to justify being a crap person to be around.

EVERYONE masks including or especially NTs.

NTs just do it naturally or don't notice that they do it.  It's how they seem to blend together with other people.

NDs call it masking because we tend to have to make a conscious effort while interacting with the world.

it's just my opion after dealing with this planet for over 50 years now so take it for what it's worth."
I feel this
"Absolutely. I was diagnosed as an adult almost eight years ago, and I'm just now learning how to unmask in my recovery time when I'm burned out. I'm finding it shortens recovery so much, but it requires a safe and trusted space/people. Allowing myself to trust was the hardest part tbh"
"What helped me most with it was constantly asking myself ""Is this me?"" with everything I was doing.  Facial expressions, tonality, what I was talking about, the way I was talking about it, whether I'm pretending to be comfortable, whether I genuinely enjoy something, etc..  It's a lot and can be overwhelming but it's a habit that I now have.  Mind you, it's only been about 6 months since I really started unmasking and I don't think I'm done yet, but it takes time and I'm being as patient with myself as possible.  And even if something is mental illness, it is still a part of you.  I think it's best to first move towards being yourself before trying to figure out why you are that way."
Hahaha we must have the same mom. Sigh! if only she knew how hurtful this was
"Lmao my mom has said the exact same, almost word for word. She is a covert narcissist, but it's just such a ridiculously shitty thing to say to your kid."
That hurts... I'm sorry about that...
"I have seen this comment so many times all over the Internet — you're not alone in this! You are still there, I promise. 

FWIW, trauma-informed therapy (for me, Internal Family Systems, “parts work”) has been the best way to rediscover myself and reconnect to pieces of myself that I thought were lost."
I’m currently finding out the real me doesn’t talk well at all
This is the feeling that lead me down the path to diagnosis. I was essentially having an identity crisis because the public me was so different than the private me.
Still figuring this out too. Why is dialog a one way street?
Woah. This is my exact experience too. It’s so draining
"This hurt me to read, absolutely so relatable. Sometimes I gaslight myself into thinking I do get to share about myself but I get so caught up in my RSD/feeling ignored or interrupted that it overshadows, but no, truly I don't get to talk about myself much and I think that's why I tend to dump information unceremoniously on anyone who I perceive to give even an ounce of a fuck. How do I make people care about me and my interests?"
"Dude there's a lot more to telling a story than just the delivery of the story itself. You have to know how to read the room. It has to be the right time and place. Your body language MATTERS. There's a ton of things you have to be good at doing, and if you're not, people are not going to listen to you. Unless it's out of pity. And trust me. You don't want pity listeners. 

If you want to get better at this, read books. You need to do a lot of research on this. You don't have the natural born charisma that a lot of other people clearly have. You can't afford to go about your social life relying on nothing but your bare wits. 

First you need to read The Laws of Human Nature. That's the most fundamental one by far. Then start reading stuff by Carl Jung. Man and his Symbols helped me immensely. The 48 Laws of Power will show you how others try to manipulate you. Storytelling books are also great to read. The Psychology of Persuasion will also teach you what kinds of persuasion neurotypicals will respond to"
You deserve to explore this. But I recommend neuropsych evaluation.
"Sympathies. My attempts at unmasking have been pretty unsuccessful, in terms of the response I get, too."
Brilliant actually
"I didn’t realize for a long time that most humans do not talk about their problems or highlight their failings

What? I think I do it too.."
Very well put
"Unmasking is a process that a person goes through. It is the process of removing the ""masks"" - the parts of our identity that are not our own, but placed upon by others in our lives - and replacing them with our true selves. Before one can learn their limits, they must first be able to explore the edges of those limits. This gets messy and uncomfortable for everyone. Maybe no one is trying to be an ass hole, and everyone is just doing their best where they are on their own journey."
"I definitely agree that there seems to be a “grey area” in the approach of unmasking. 

It seems like some individuals are using it as an excuse to be a shitty person , like you said. If unmasking means you now loose your shit at people for no good reason and blame Autism, you are a shitty person.. etc 

I however don’t believe that in the process of unmasking that not forcing eye contact, not forcing small talk or faking excessive emotions (that you don’t even feel) to make the other person comfortable is being a shitty person. 

Being outright rude and ignoring people is definitely not the right approach , however we shouldn’t be expected to force things like eye contact or extended small talk if it makes us uncomfortable, so the other person is comfortable. 

There’s a grey area , between not forcing ourselves to do uncomfortable things and also doing what society deems polite/acceptable. This makes unmasking so much more complex. 

Part of my journey to unmasking is me just being more authentic, I’m reducing or if at all forcing eye contact when I don’t feel like it, limiting small talk (so I don’t ignore them , but don’t continue the conversation), only eat/do what I feel like (as long as the activity doesn’t interfere with others) and just overall looking out for my needs, mentally and also sensory. I, like most of us here can probably relate, have spent my entire life masking to the point where acting my personality to fit in has been my normal. I was sick of having to act all day everyday, pretend I was someone else , just for it to burn me out, make me depressed, and still not get friends or happiness in the process. 

Since beginning to unmask, I have mentally started recovering ( a long process given the years it’s been happening ), I do seem to feel more alienated, as my traits are showing more, but I haven’t had that impact me anywhere near as much as I thought it would ( a little difficult since I started with no friends anyway)."
This is a succinct observation
"Contemplative practices helps calm the nervous

Can you extend on that?"
"Your advice does not apply to all people with autism. What works for you does not work for everyone. It's important that you make that distinction, but it's even more important that the people reading your comments make that distinction and i'm concerned that they won't."
"I had two narc parents and a narc older sister. Them and me, in my family. Guess who was the family scapegoat. My father especially turned his attentions to me with the abuse because you 1) can't get supply from a narc unless it's a covert using the abuse for their own purposes (like my mother), and my sister was an overt who couldn't be hurt and manipulated emotionally: and two, my sister wasn't both physically weak and ill, and autiHD, undiagnosed. It seems like a lot of us undergo abuse whether we have narc parents or not; I suspect people who might be indifferent, inadequate parents at best--which frankly I think is most people--turn actively abusive when confronted with a child that has any issues at all. 

Not that my parents wouldn't have been abusive anyway. They were narcs."
"Very well spoken, thank you. You and we all deserve better than this."
Identity and gender “dysphoria” are primary characteristics of autism.
We deserve better tho. I hope you can find more freedom over time.
How are you behaving when unmasked?
"Thank you. I'm at work rn. I have no idea if I'm truly autistic and if what I'm referring to truly is masking/unmasking, in the sense that I haven't been officially diagnosed. But I'll use these words nonetheless, because they feel right.

I feel like sometimes, I can be in this strange state where every color, every wind, every interaction, every sound, movement, moment, is tasteful. I don't need to be on my phone 24/7 anymore because there's so much happening, and it feels nice, it's soothing. I just feel home. And suddenly I don't to look at people in the streets to receive their validation anymore. I just avoid everyone. Leave me alone unless required otherwise. I don't speak unless I truly feel like it. I do it in the metro, or when I go to the museum, or when I walk, or yesterday when I went to the pharmacy.

It's a very isolating state of being. But I really enjoy it.

But at work.. it was just making things awkward this morning, with my boss, so I switched back to the funny goofball I can be (I went through 10 years of improv comedy, I've learned). So yeah, all that to say, it feels like it wasn't the right moment to do it at all at work. I didn't have a choice.

Edit : forgot to mention, it's a very delicate state, if I go back to looking and sounding cool for one moment the state is gone and I'll have to wait hours or days for it to come back."
"Well said. We tend to be traumatized, some to the point of PTSD, and have black and white thinking as a result. The grey area you speak of clearly comes with time and experience."
"I've done 10 years of improv comedy. I can be very enthusiastic and funny and welcoming and cheering... People love it!

...yeah"
You deserve space to relax and be yourself. The anxiety caused by masking is exhausting.
This is burnout. The mask just…fails. We can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube. Upward and onward. I hope you and we can find ways to relax and be true to ourselves and our physical and mental needs.
"Sorry that was worded a little sloppy - just to be clear, I don’t mean that all unmasking should be equated to “acting like an asshole” but in my case I was heavily camouflaging my communication style to basically kissing everyone’s ass all the time to feel safe (the “fawn” response) and I went from that to super blunt, not caring who I offended at all for a bit."
"Very much how it feels when I let ""this part of me"" out. Delicate, vulnerable, sensitive, unsafe, but also extremely connected to what's surrounding me, more genuine, and any genuine form of interaction with someone willing to meet ""this part of me"", is a bliss."
"I def want to read that. The back made me cry. Was waiting til I felt I could read the whole thing without it overwhelming me emotionally, but it looks amazing."
I’ll have to keep volunteering in mind. I’m pretty sure it’s going to get lonelier this next year for me.
As I’m getting older I’m starting to prioritize my own happiness. So I may be lonely but I’m more true to myself
"Vocal stims are my thing, and rocking when it's really bad.

I don't even realize I'm doing it until people ask me to quiet down."
"For me if I don’t mask people think my lack of communication on certain things means something. For instance if I don’t come up with an artificially excited type of response the person often thinks I am not interested. 

Keeping relatively flat generally means I am having a negative reaction to whatever someone else is saying or doing. In their eyes, that is."
"I’m told I need to change and I have no idea how my unmasking (or even being on the spectrum) is making people feel upset I can’t communicate, or rather I don’t communicate in the way expected of me.

Note: this is feedback from my wife."
"You sound either not autistic, or so autistic that you are not being compassionate for those of us having a different, more difficult time than you. Either way, not helpful."
"Never in the history of ever have i heard neurotypicals discuss their everyday neurotypical masking. But as soon as an autist mentions masking, suddenly it's ""oh that's something all neurotypical people do all the time, too.""  Hmm 🤔"
Thanks this was helpful.
Thanks.
"How does that make sense?

(this is a genuine question. How do you explain your mask can speak and ""seem normal"", but you can't speak? I'm just trying to get information)"
"Just bc someone happens to be bad at telling stories, which you don't know if this person even is, doesn't mean that everyone should ignore them. And getting better at telling stories doesn't mean that people will stop ignoring them. You clearly don't know what you're talking about"
"Youre making so many negative assumptions about this person! Youre assuming they have bad storytelling skills, that they cant read a room, that its the wrong time and place, that they have poor body language... Where is all of this coming from? All they said was ""if i try to [...] tell a story i'm ignored"" and you immediately attack all of their communication skills as if theyre an alien from another planet and not a human being. It's terribly rude."
"Had one but they were either looking for a boy who thought frogs flying was impossible and would stop the entire test or they were looking for an engineer with no social aptitude (/Gen) and I'm too cunt for that. 💅 (/j) 

No but for real, I'm such a good masker that without a deep conversation to explore that, which my eval didn't have, they concluded I am not autistic because I didn't check one of the boxes well enough.

Honestly I'm like we'll fuck that then. I waited 6 months in a horribly stressful job needing therapy twice a week to make it and they weren't curious about unobvious symptoms.

Now I'm unemployed and using savings (easy to save when you don't want to live) while taking the time to listen ""to my autism"" for lack of better words to gather more data on current symptoms.

I had a whole 2 years' worth of info from childhood but I didn't want to go in with a binder and get invalidated. Looks like I made the wrong choice.

Anybody reading this, make sure to grill your evaluator during the first conversation on if they look for adult autism, late diagnosed autism, masked autism, and non-""asshole male who stops the whole room from moving to argue over a small detail until the information is perfectly accurate and has never been challenged not to do that through abuse during all of his formative years..."" autism.

The diagnosis would be great for accomadations or disability so I could finish school or something. But that's been kept from me so I'm just going to keep working at finding symptoms and things that are draining me that I've suppressed my whole life. Money will have to figure itself out. Yay falling through cracks"
Thanks!
"Replacing a mask with a 'true self' is merely replacing one mask for another mask the ego prefers.  If we disregard other's impressions of us in favor of being our 'true selves' there is a slippery slope to narcissism ahead. (Almost) No one ever tries to be an asshole. Everyone's behavior is co-regulated by others, this is not a matter of masking or finding yourself.   
There is no self. Look for it, you won't find it. There are conglomerated processes and functions, none of which are you, and none of which are less than you. But there is no ultimate self-referent. One can allude to the mystery of this, but one cannot describe it in language.   
It's a more complex conversation than is suitable for reddit, and I think I would have lot of explaining to do."
"NO. You are not a shitty person if you sometimes have a weak moment, get upset or even have an irrational meltdown. Autistic brains and neurochemistry are physically different than NTs and this handicap’s primary characteristic is emotional dysregulation. Learning to improve our reactions and behavior is much more difficult than an NT person, and requires, patience, help, years of therapy, and forgiveness from ourselves, our friends and family, AND our autistic community."
"The style of contemplative practices I do are about realizing wholeness beyond what the human psyche can grasp.

Autism, as I understand it, it primarily a mismatch between the phenomena that appears and the pre-programmed reaction to that phenomena. Andy Clark's book Surfing Uncertainty has probably the best technical description of neurodivergence that I've read, so check that out if you want to know more about how autism is essentially a misfiring predictive model.

Autistics are good at building very detailed predictive models to avoid certain types of negative feelings, IE masking etc. The problem occurs when we mistake those predictive models for reality, when we've only been able to build them on data that we've already taken in. In other words, having *certainty* about predictive models is always delusional, yet many of us defer to those models to shape our choices.

In realizing wholeness, I am shifting my knowingness to knowing no-thing in particular except reality. This sounds easy or even what 'most people do', but I assure you it is the most rare state in the world to view reality as it actually is without filtering it through our pre-conceived notions. This means relaxing the reflex to self-identify in anyway including as a human.

Contemplative practice is about relaxing this reflex to self-identify, and instead resist the habit to conceptualize about any thing at all. This is very difficult because it defies the survival instinct. I have a hypothesis that this helps because autism is, in essence, a survival instinct run amok. But it doesn't make things 'ok', what it does is confront the mind with the naked horror of existence and yet find beauty, truth, and inherent goodness beyond personal or impersonal category.

My guide to contemplative practice has been David Chaim Smith, look him up if you want to understand more."
That comment contains no advice. It contains my observations and my own practices.
Agreed. I'm sorry you had to go through all of that.
"Thank you for the kind words. :) 

I'm hanging in there. Sorta."
I just sit in silence and read a lot. I eat what is available rather than what people would sci spider a meal.
great thing about volunteering is you meet people with really big hearts. that wnat to put out love and care into the world.
"> “I may be lonely but I'm more true to myself”

**THAT PART**

People who love me exactly as I am are more precious than platinum. 

I'm not saying there's no feedback — on the contrary, they communicate about my behavior with compassion, even when I do something they might not like."
"There’s just something about vocal stims that are the best. I tend to rotate every few weeks with a word or sentence. 

Stuff randomly like, beans, yeah boyyyy, that’s the issue, “that’s bloody lovely that” - in a British accent, “A” (but pronounced AHHYEE). 

I love going home or the drive home so I can just unleash all of them I was building up for the day."
"YES. When I first learned I am autistic and said “what were my stims?”, which are completely repressed causing severe anxiety, over time I realized vocal stims were my main thing ( and rocking). Letting them come out after 25 years of suppression has been a weird process, where at first I felt like I was faking it, or insecure, and then slowly I have just tried to relax and see what happens. Everything from vocalizing emotions with growling and weird hums and sighs, to lots of TV and movie and cartoon voices, and phrases from decades of watching video."
Yep. I actually started using exclamation points in written communication for this very reason and people are generally receiving me better
"THIS. I’m either flat like TV static and freak people out, or I overcorrect and get hyper and freak people out."
"Ive been been clinically diagnosed over 10 years ago and did my best to raise two children on the spectrum as well.  The eldest holds down a decent full time job and younger shes figuring out her place in the rold.  Neither of them stuck entirely in their rooms unable to do anything for themselves.  So, I think have a bit of experience to share.

  
That being said many, many posts talk about unmasking as being some sort of wonder cure and that their lives are better for not doing it anymore.  And I suppose if you did not have to interact with the outside world to survive, I suppose that could work, but it could end up being a very isolated existence.

  
The world is a harsh and uncaring place at the best of times.  And if you need people to be at least somewhat sympathetic to the issues you are facing in life you need to show that you are trying to meet them halfway."
"they dont talk like that because they generally dont even think about needing to think about they have to interact with other people.

  
they pickup on those unspoken hints and clues without even thinking about it.  Thats a big part of what being neurotyical is.

  
But go ahead live in your rose colored world where everyone that does not think like you is an idiot.  Its a very autistic way to view the world."
"I personally used to preplan what I was expected to say.  People would say that I was well-spoken but the reality was that I stopped listening to what they were saying halfway through so that I could prepare an eloquent response.  Now that I don't pre-plan, I talk more slowly and with pauses.  I'm actually thinking much more in-depth about what I'm saying now, but it can be easily misinterpreted as me being distracted or being a really poor talker."
"Because we feign various personalities to suit whoever we’re talking to, expertly reacting in ways to make people happy ( because we have over excited neurons and and more mirror neurons than normal) and when we stop masking, we are like a different person."
"When masking, I devote most if not all of my energy to speaking and expressing myself in a way that makes sense to other people. Often appearing well spoken. I’ve realized it takes a ton of energy to use my mouth and throat muscles to push words out verbally. This leaves me with headaches, fatigue, dysregulation (and more) after social situations. The more I have social situations that I have to do this the more meltdowns and anxiety I have. The more I unmask, the more I realize I don’t feel like devoting the energy to speaking verbally and would rather use speech to text, or other ways to communicate."
"If you cannot hold people's interest, they will not pay attention to you. 

It is as simple as that. If you don't like it, you can go find people here on the Reddit communities who have not had luck in real life either"
It's not my fault you can't handle the truth. Go get help
Well... I certainly wasn't expecting a ride on the nihilism train.... I'm just offering that maybe people struggle their processes in different ways and we can just offer each other some grace.
"This articulated something I have been suspecting for a while now, and feel gaslit by others into thinking there is a ""me"""
"I think you may have misunderstood me, 

Everyone gets angry, everyone looses their shit. Everyone has moments they aren’t proud of, especially us on the spectrum. Our emotional dysregulation means this is more likely to happen. 

If we have a meltdown or get angry and start yelling because we are super over stimulated etc, ASD is an explanation, and this is going to happen at times. It’s however not an excuse to consistently abuse others.

Im not saying we can’t loose our anger now and then, im referring to people who consistently yell , insult and abuse other people and use Autism as an excuse. Maybe I should have been more specific in my comment! 

Autistic people are allowed to get angry, I definitely do, I have moments my emotional dysregulation really shows,  but if I consistently behave like that in a way that hurts other people, and refuse to change, that makes me a shitty person."
"Let me rephrase that.

Everything you're saying does not apply to all people with autism. Youre only describing what works for you."
"Exactly!!! My wife told me last week she didn’t think I’d find happiness after marriage with her because of autism.

That’s a giant red flag IMHO.

I talked with her about it. She said I took it out of context (I confirmed with her at the time that’s what she said!!). And stumbled over her words as she tried to explain it."
"Haha I collect phrases from movies series and YouTubers like precious gemstones. I have this one ""my friends, it just keeps happening"" from a YouTuber, I can say it again and again. And again."
"I don't even say phrases. I go like ""bop bop bop"" and click my lips (bc I like the sensation and it's calming) so I do the sound effects kind.

I do do it much more now that older I'm older, but usually when I'm alone or da kine."
Omg. These are stims?!?! I had no idea!! I knew I always did them and others don’t. But wow!! lol
All morning I've been singing wingly wangley wongle ding dang dong to a news theme tune.  The moment the house is empty it all comes out. My dogs don't seem to mind tho
Same!! It really works haha
"My partner and I have been struggling on the communication front also. We have agreed to use more written communication to allow each other (myself, really) more time to process before responding. I am finding it helps me to take more time to build the sentences that convey what I mean. So far, this is helping us communicate better."
"It is so dumb that we have to do this, but I do it too."
I was doing good at this for a while but I'm so burnt out atm and I hate doing it so much!
“Ha ha! I am laughing at your joke now and making human faces! I enjoy this conversation!”
"> But go ahead live in your rose colored world where everyone that does not think like you is an idiot. Its a very autistic way to view the world.

What is your problem? You do know I'm not the same person you were talking to before, right? Or do you know that but insist on being rude and making assumptions about me anyway? I never said anyone who doesn't think like me is an ""idiot"" nor did I ever imply that.

And what the hell does ""very autistic way to view the world"" mean?  Are you a self-hating autist or are you just not autistic at all? I'm autistic and I would never in my life think of using such a phrase to insult someone.

And I haven't even touched on the fact that your RUDE reply doesn't address the main point of my comment."
"Bro, what are you talking about? Did you even read the guys comment?"
"I save your comment for later, because I'll need to observe my own process. That's very interesting"
"You have a pretty sad worldview. Often times me and my friends talk about nothing interesting or tell really bad stories, but we still listen to each other bc we care about each other. Pity that you haven't experienced that"
"That is entirely situational.  I have plenty of friends that are happy to have me around even when I'm talking about something they don't care about because they know that it makes me happy and they want me to be happy.  I'm the same way for them.  On the other hand, I've had a lot people literally walk away from me while I'm mid-sentence because there was something more interesting to them than me talking about a video game.  Whether someone will listen to you despite their lack of interest is entirely rooted in how they feel about you.  I get that you've clearly had a lot of bad experiences with people, but not everyone is entirely self-centered."
What did i say that was incorrect? If you cant enunciate that then you dont have a leg to stand on.
"Grace is exactly what I'm advocating for, but to most materialists that comes across as nihilism. I get it. I used to be in that camp too. Virtually anyone trained in the modern university system is. It treats the psyche as an object. There is nothing more nihilistic than self-objectification, which what I'm saying is the big mistake."
"Yes. That's why I made statements about myself.  
For those who take self referential statements as implied calls to action, its likely that people in their early development made self-referential statements and then blamed them for not acting upon the unstated implication.  
I've had to unlearn this particular pattern handed to me by my parents. My first instinct when my wife makes a statement about how she's feeling is to try to manage that."
"As soon as my roommates are gone, the house gets very vocal."
That’s great to hear
Hey if you want to spew nonsense all day with your friends then be my guest. But don't try to say I'm weird for not doing your strange activities
"First of all I didn't attack anyone. It's just criticism. 

Of course, someone like you with low self-esteem probably can't distinguish between genuine criticism and a personal attack."
"Buddhism is challenging for those of us on the spectrum, lord absurd. Many of us have daily physical pain, overwhelm, sensory difficulties , anxiety and PTSD that preclude our ability to function at a base level of calm that is required to then transcend our material situation. Point taken, but not helpful here. We autistics are not a monolith and many are suffering more than you, and have every right to focus on themselves after decades of masking and trauma."
Are you a psychologist?
I didn't even say that lmao. I'm just saying you're incorrect for saying that no one will listen unless you're saying something interesting or you're a good storyteller
"Criticism implies there's something to criticise. But in this case there was nothing to criticise except the things you made up (assumed) about the person. That's not *genuine criticism* and i'm offended you think i'm dumb enough to believe such a feckless excuse. 

If youre going to be upset, be upset at yourself for posting these comments."
"I'm not a Buddhist. I also have everything you described; pain, overwhelm, sensory difficulties, anxiety, including decades of masking Autism and CPTSD from sexual abuse.   
No amount of those precludes anyone from aspiring to being the way they wish to be. Yes, it is more difficult for us, but there is no material situation that 'clears' you to transcend materiality.   
If you wait for one, you'll be waiting until death, and then you'll transcend it whether you want to or not. Most humans release that materiality only with a tremendous amount of regret and suffering.   
Is it better to practice releasing it now or wait until it's ripped from us?   
I only know which I'd rather do, and maybe it's futile to try to help but maybe not. 

Focusing on one's trauma can easily result in it being the largest object of thought in one's life. If this happens, one will never grow beyond it. I'm not advocating ignoring it, it can either shrink and be integrated or grow and dominate your life. The energy and attitude one brings to it determines the result. I believe we are more than our past would suggest.     


Just because a suggestion is not helpful for you, doesn't mean it's not helpful for someone else reading this. If anyone had told me years ago that my reactions to these things were actually within my control and given me places to follow up, I'd be much better off."
"Of course someone will listen. I'm sure there's plenty of hobos who would be fascinated with you. My point is that unless you want to be the resident wallflower at every party for the rest of your life, you have to make the effort to become a bit more interesting. It's not about ""stories"" or whatever"
I don't know the Webster's New World definition of criticism but it does sound like you're criticizing me right now
"Wow someone's butthurt bc I told you were wrong. And fun fact, people love me at parties and I don't make that much effort. Never read a book about stydying the atmosphere or anything lmao"
"Yes, i am criticising you."
You sound like one of those people who pretends to be autistic because it's trending on Tiktok and you are desperate for something that'll make you unique
Say criticize one more time. And spell it correctly we're in America now
And you sound like you have no friends
"Criticism implies there's something to criticise. But in this case there was nothing to criticise except the things you made up (assumed) about the person. That's not genuine criticism and i'm offended you think i'm dumb enough to believe such a feckless excuse.

If youre going to be upset, be upset at yourself for posting these comments."
"Look I think you're getting a bit too deep into it and I really didn't mean to be all technical like what you're trying to do. I just gave a few simple suggestions since the guy was complaining about a lot of thing

But hey. If you don't want strangers' input, then don't air out your issues on a public forum. Lol"
">  If you don't want strangers' input, then don't air out your issues on a public forum. 

Take your own advice. Please."
How am I not taking my own advice? I never said I have to agree with you. You seem to be confused about a lot of things
"What scares me about you is you keep making things up about people and then attacking the thing you made up. First it was that person's supposed poor storytelling abilities (something you just made up), and now you're attacking me for allegedly saying you have to agree with me (I think we can both agree I never said that). 

I'm not afraid of you on reddit of course, but IRL I'd consider you a dangerous person to be around.

Are you aware you're making these things up or is this occurring subconsciously?"
"Since you keep bringing it up, I'll say it:

If you tell a story, and people do not listen to that story, and this is something that happens pretty often, guess what? You're probably not that good at telling stories. 

It's not ""assuming"". It's putting 1 and 2 together and finding out that (wow) it equals 3. 

The only one who's assuming is you. Apparently you think I'm a ""dangerous"" person just because I disagree with you. Like, seriously dude? Make it make sense for me. What even is your logical thought process in coming up with this bs"
"Yes, I often pretend not to be as smart as I am. Otherwise you're Sheldon Cooper."
"Absolutely.  My therapist says I have ""high processing speed"", though I never did a proper test as far as I know.  But it doesn't really mean I get things done quickly, because I also have to take so many details into consideration.

The therapist who diagnosed me said that it probably helped with finding strategies to adapt, but at some point, I didn't have the energy to do it anymore.  And it leads to people thinking I am just being difficult, lazy, annoying...  and when the masks slips, and I do have a meltdown, they are bad. I tried to explain my difficulties, but somehow it always came across wrong. Like I was asking too much. And when I did stop functioning, I was called manipulative.

My current problem is that I kinda have the ability to ignore how exhausted I am, so I keep going until nothing goes anymore.

I had a few presentations in the last weeks, and they turned out really well. But while presenting, I had that voice in my head telling me to speak up! control my tone! make appropriate eye contact! watch my body language! And after the presentations, I was so spent I could barely think straight. My class mates were very impressed, but it's learned and rehearsed behaviour and does not come easy to me at all. 

It is both a blessing and a curse. I am glad I have the ability to do things, but I also need people to be understanding because I can't perform well all the time and it's difficult to understand why I can't do something g."
"Yes, I feel it’s difficult to ask for help without people imaging you couldn’t need any."
"Someone is trying to spill their problems to you:

Mind immediately goes “why don’t you just do this A>B” it seems quite obvious. I refrain and just empathize. Think everyone suffers with this but especially the autistic high IQ individual"
"Have you heard of the “gifted kid to burnout from undiagnosed neurodivergence pipeline”? It’s a more comical way of referring to exactly what you describe - how for many of us, we didn’t receive the accommodations we needed when younger because our high performance academically/intellectually and effectiveness at masking led others to perceive us as not needing any."
"Blessing. 

Although at 62 I'm still overestimating people's intelligence. Which is an ongoing source of frustration...

I mask like a champ and I don't really have any expectations about how people should feel about my struggles. I know my struggles and I don't need their affirmations."
"I've never been very good at masking despite having a high IQ, so no.

It's been a frank advantage to be smart because to an extent I can cognitively emulate functions of parts of my brain that don't work correctly or whatever. I don't know if this is IQ-related necessarily but I was eventually able to teach myself to be self-aware, how to tolerate unpleasant sensory stimuli, how to make sense of my feelings and how to be aware of the thoughts of others. Life would be so much harder if I had difficulty thinking abstractly or recalling information so that I couldn't even simulate those things. That's not to say that I don't still struggle, but people who say that intelligence is a curse or whatever are average redditors and full of it. A lot of people on the spectrum have cognitive abilities on the lower end and I feel that it's actually pretty insulting to them to suggest this ""no no being intelligent is actually le bad because people overestimate you"""
"what do you mean by high iq?

i'm a ph. d. candidate and therefore what people usually think of as a Smart Person (if they've never met academics, we are actually super fucking dumb most of the time), and i need assistance to do some pretty basic stuff like buying milk.

i'm not even very emotionally intelligent, i spend my free time provoking harry potter and star wars fans on social media which i'm sure isn't something a well-adjusted person would do."
"Yah, it sucks, it *kinda* helped me for a REALLY long time, until it didn’t"
"I've never taken an IQ test so I don't know if I have a high IQ. But I intentionally dumb myself down at work because if I show my full intelligence, my supervisor will have unrealistic expectations of me"
Among autists (according to studies) masking is associated with higher IQ and more anxiety btw.

"Yes. People still have it stuck in their heads that only those with intellectual disabilities and are completely non-verbal can be autistic. This was especially a thing for my parents. I've gotten so good at just doing what's ""expected behavior"" and covering up what isn't expected (such as stimming) that people just think I'm lazy or just a crabby person. Really though, I do want to talk but struggle to communicate. I try and streamline everything so I don't go into full blown mental exhaustion before the day is even over from having to do extra work that can be avoided with the same quality (or better) output. I never got diagnosed as a kid because parents thought everything was normal. I can't entirely blame them, but I wish I didn't have to now figure everything out that I didn't learn earlier, as an adult."
"I don’t think it’s fair to link high IQ with masking. I have multiple degrees including a masters, but I have level 2 autism and struggle a lot socially and with communication and I am unable to mask."
"Omg yeah, this speaks to me. I’m guessing the main reason why nobody questioned if I had autism until age 12 is because I was “academically gifted”. Not top of the class gifted, but in the top 3-5. My brother got diagnosed a lot faster because he struggled a lot more in school. It’s both good and bad, good that I didn’t really struggle at schoolwork but bad because I went through 12 years of being an outcast without anyone giving me any charitability."
"Yes. more a curse then anything. I have had to hide my ability to think from partners who found it intimidating. It also hurts when i can see people feel like I am being condescending because Im talking about something ""intelligent"". took years to come to peace with it before my diagnosis(get diagnosed recently as an adult.)"
"I subscribe to the theory of multiple intelligences. Meaning that I believe that intelligence is a spectrum, and that a person can be high IQ in one area and low IQ in another area.

Because of that, I have a hard time answering your question because IQ is being generalized."
"Yes, and for years I intentionally “dumbed myself down” as part of the mask."
"I have ""handsome"" privilege and a high IQ with special interests in learning. High school was a breeze. It's like pulling teeth trying to get my own fucking parents to see my differently abledness"
yup
"Thank you for replying! I swear the more I talk to people, the more I feel that I grasp some of my own experiences better.😅😊"
"I’m a bit late to this thread so I fully understand if you don’t reply to this but the scenario you described resonates with me on a deep level… and also validates the traumatic, career-ending experience I had while attempting to obtain my Ph.D. Interested in hearing more about your experiences and perspectives on this issue—both personally, and in terms of accommodation rights in higher education"
"That’s awesome! I’m glad you’re able to have such a positive outlook on things! I try to be the same way, I just feel a little alone on my struggles sometimes when I feel like I cant talk about my suspicions of what may be causing them. It would be nice to have some understanding from those around me you know? I guess it’s just an anxious thing.😅hopefully someday I can get somewhere with it. I’ll sure keep trying."
"Well that may be the experience for those people tho. They may have experienced overestimation because of their intelligence shining immensely in an area (likely multiple and in areas where it “counts” to most people) but then having a difficulty in another that gets promptly chalked up to “you just don’t WANT to do [insert difficult thing here].” But thanks for sharing your pov, intelligence is helpful."
"I mean…the definition of IQ is just a measurement of how well a person can use reasoning to apply facts and logic learned through observation or experience to solve problems…so I mean high IQ as in having a large amount of success in that very category- having a substantial amount of intelligence and ability to problem solve through logic and reasoning based on observations and facts. I hope that doesn’t sound mean, I only mean to clarify. Hope that helps!"
"Being in academia has been fun because 1) the concentration of autistic people is suuuuper high - where else will you find people who want to be experts on a hyper-specific part of their interests- and 2) I no longer feel bad about the chaos my life becomes when I’m forced to keep myself alive and also be good at my job, because absolutely no one in this field has a work/life balance or the ability to act like a functional adult outside of their work."
"Getting a degree is more about work ethic than intelligence. Not that I'm saying you're not intelligent. But yeah this is a stupid assumption.

Personally my social skills have improved to the point that they don't affect my life strongly in a negative way because I know how to carry on a conversation, and I don't tell people irl about my diagnosis, which I guess makes me sound like I am good at hiding that I have autism but I don't think I actually am. I think I kind of suck at it but since I'm level 1 I come across as a bit off but not necessarily like there's something ""wrong"" with me."
"It’s true that it doesn’t apply for everyone, but masking is correlated with intelligence."
"Hmm I think I sorta get what you mean? But I would just consider the different “areas” as different types of knowledge. Intelligence is really just the ability to apply that knowledge reasonably and in a way that is helpful, so I wouldn’t say your IQ varies from subject to subject because if knowledge was withheld from you, that doesn’t make you less intelligent, you just don’t have access to that certain piece of info, and therefore cannot apply it. So like, can a person apply the facts they are given to solve problems? That is what is used to help determine IQ."
The Wechsler scale includes a lot of different facets. Things like musical ability correlates strongly with fluid ability so basically you’re studying the same construct.
">They may have experienced overestimation because of their intelligence shining immensely in an area (likely multiple and in areas where it “counts” to most people) but then having a difficulty in another that gets promptly chalked up to “you just don’t WANT to do [insert difficult thing here].”

That's happened to me before, but I'm just saying that even having the ability to broadcast competence is an unambiguous privilege. I've been on the other side of this where people patronize me and the former is a lot better."
"Well, technically IQ us not just applying facts and logic. The Wechsler scale measures verbal comprehension, logical/spatial reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. Also sometime fluid reasoning is broken out as a 5th category. The structure of the scale has changed over the years, but these are the five general areas that are scored when assessing “IQ.”

I score extremely high in verbal comprehension, logical/spatial reasoning, and fluid reasoning. So standardized tests are a breeze, and I grew up with everyone claiming I am a genius. But my working memory is trash, and my processing speed is, like, sub-human. (This particular combination of scores is apparently exceedingly rare. Sprinkle in social difficulty, demand avoidance, executive function problems, hypersensitivities, and sensory stimming like dermatillomania, and you start to see why I lurk in this sub.)

Thing is, I can reason my way through most situations, and I’ve never been able to rely on memory or recall to help me. So I am very used to walking into situations and just winging it, relying on my “intelligence” to get me through. I can perform at an average level when I must cover for my weaknesses, and at a high level in areas that play to my strengths. Unfortunately, even though people act like I’m a genius, the fact is that in several areas I am equivalent to someone with a very low IQ. And those difficulties are often not acknowledged and not tolerated. 

This has made me **amazing** at masking. Like, ridiculously good. Unfortunately masking at this level tires me out and causes anxiety. 

So tl;dr: yeah, the struggle is real. 

I will say, though, that understanding the different areas of “IQ,” and being able to really pinpoint the trouble areas that have been the basis of my difficulties growing up, has been fantastically useful. Knowing my brain better has allowed me to tweak my own expectations of myself, and to be kind and forgiving to myself in times when I used to be hard on myself."
"lol

this is more or less how someone who wants to define themselves via their IQ would respond to that kind of question, don't worry."
"politely, i've run into a **lot** of bullshit because i'm visibly relatively higher needs and have a comorbid schizophrenia spectrum disorder, which makes working with me honestly pretty difficult. a lot of ""sorry i missed my deadline babs but i'm pretty sure an evil cabal of psychiatrists were trying to plant cameras under my eyes"" lol.

anyway, i've run into a lot of older profs treating a friend next to me like my case worker, dismissive comments, ""and you showed it to a friend to make sure nothing cuhraaazy made its way into your writing?"" etc. one of my friends is an indigenous woman which is surprisingly pretty rare in the history field here, and people treat her with a similar bigotry of low expectations attitude, assuming she's mostly working on black emu-type stuff. the highlight was back in my master's, when a low needs prof with an ""always unique, totally intelligent, sometimes mysterious"" poster on her wall told me that i need to stop requesting so many accommodations / opportunities to attend lectures and so on electronically instead of in-person, because ""it makes it look as if people like us can't do the job."" 

i totally believe that there are a lot of bubbles in other fields or other universities that are absolutely accommodating and made up of people who get it, but that hasn't been my experience yet. but! once i have my shit i can probably move on elsewhere. i also think it might be a field thing, lib arts and especially history in australia can be very very very white, cishet and NT depending on where you are."
"Nah. Critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity are also essential qualities that contribute to success in a graduate program.  People who lack all of those those skills can’t get a PhD even with excellent work ethic.

There’s a reason there are no one with non-mosaic Down syndrome has an official PhD. They have plenty of intelligence, but not the kind that can earn them a PhD."
"Maybe it depends on the type of intelligence too, I am good at stem but not very good at humanities and communication/writing based areas."
"The idea is that intelligence can be physical, musical, interpersonal, etc.

[https://www.verywellmind.com/gardners-theory-of-multiple-intelligences-2795161](https://www.verywellmind.com/gardners-theory-of-multiple-intelligences-2795161)

It's not so much about acquiring knowledge."
Yeah I think I understand. It is better to be treated like you’re smart than to be treated like you’re dumb. Not that I’m calling anyone smart or dumb! I just know that’s the treatment that’s usually given based on how other people perceive someone.
"
I should have clarified that I meant that work ethic is more important than intelligence in academia *assuming your intelligence is at least average*, which most people's is. Obviously an IQ 50 isn't realistically going to be getting a non-honorary PhD no matter how hard they work, so some level of intelligence is necessary, but it's not sufficient. 

There are people with full Trisomy 21 and average to above-average intelligence, although it's exceptionally rare. Charlotte Fien is one."
Whether you’re good at humanities and STEM isn’t exactly determined by type of intelligence but I get your point.
"Ohh yeah I get what you mean when you put it that way! Sorry. Like how there’s different types of health like physical, social, mental etc."
"Ah I see what you’re saying. Well then yeah, 100iq (which is average iQ) and grit can earn someone a PhD."
"Exactly, and nothing to apologize about. 

For example, some people have great interpersonal intelligence and can really excel as a therapist, but maybe they don't have good logical-mathematical intelligence. That doesn't mean that they aren't high IQ, but a standard IQ test might rank them lower than they really are based on the intelligence they're being tested on. 

Same with a professional athlete. They might have incredible bodily-kinesthetic intelligence while lacking musical intelligence, etc ad-nauseum."
I think even someone with an 80 IQ could get a PhD in a high interest area depending on the individual.
"Hmmmmmm maybe. That’s nearing intellectual disability 

I wanna know what the lowest iQ PhD is out there. Those kinds of statistics don’t exist"
"Thing weren’t changing even as I was getting older and more knowledgeable and trying a variety of different strategies. I was in my late 20s and still having the same problems with being in an office 5 days a week that I had in my early 20s, even though nearly everything in my life was radically different, and I realized something might be wrong internally."
"When i heard someone who’s autistic say that a majority of their thoughts during conversation is ""how would a normal person respond ?"" I laughed it off like haha me, then more stuff about autism started coming up and everything clicked. I always knew there was something going on, you know that unshakable feeling that you’re an alien and must blend in otherwise they’ll know you’re weird and your world would crumble"
"When my autistic ex-boyfriend, who was also a doctor, looked at me and exclaimed:  

“Oh wow, you’re autistic too!!”

Then he proceeded to point out all my ‘tisms. And there were many. Autism was one of his special interests. He sent me many medical reviews and webinars to read & watch. Learning new things is one of my special interests. He taught me a lot about autism & how to better care for myself & I am grateful for knowing him.

*edit:  we had just begun dating and he only knew me for a week or two at the time."
"I read an article about autism in women and everything clicked. The more I read now, the more sense it makes."
My child was diagnosed
"I read a fiction book where the main character had autism, which was written by an autistic author. I related to the character and the way she acted so deeply that after finishing it I immediately started researching. I’ve always felt different and like I didn’t quite fit in, but that was my real turning point in figuring it out."
"I never would’ve come to the conclusion on my own- my therapist (who works with neurodivergent clients) brought it up and it took me 2 years to really accept it. 


It all clicked when I started to look back on my life with the lens of ‘okay so maybe I am autistic- what experiences in my life have I never understood?’. Autism answered most of my questions. 

Here are the experiences I dwelled on:


• a very specific color of crayola marker used to make me gag and almost throw up


• sense of smell was off the charts. I was always smelling stuff no one else could


• I can hear electricity and people think I’m crazy but I can pinpoint which object is making the noise 


• the sun is LOUD


• drugs didn’t affect me strongly at all


• had not 1, but 2 eating disorders (hello binge eating from adhd and anorexia from autism) 


• selective eater. One bite of tendon in meat and I’m ready to end it all. 


• big, big feelings. I thought I was going insane for a long time and was institutionalized. 


• people told me I was weird all the time but I didn’t know any other way to be 


• no friends until like middle school


• obsessed with researching human behavior and the appropriate responses to things


• level of intensity of interests was much higher than my peers. 


• I had a creative partner in college who told me ‘I feel I should tell you that your brain works differently than most people. It’s a great thing to have in our industry, but I feel you should know that about yourself’. I love her very much for that and other things


• had an autistic TA that I’d talk to all the time and he ended the semester telling me his observations about my brain. I thought it was weird at the time but I think he was trying to tell me I probably had autism at the time LOL. But getting along well with other autistics was pretty affirming


• mostly a deep feeling of loneliness that I could never really understand. Just sadness inside of me that most people will never understand me and I will never understand them. 


• frustration with social norms. Nothing pisses me off more than social niceties. 


• didn’t smile as a kid either 


Sorry that’s so long. There’s so much more but I tried to pick the highlights :p"
I noticed that I get irrationally angry whenever someone tells me to do something.. I didn't even know I was feeling anger only that there was intense discomfort leading to confusion and disorientation.. I read something about PDA and thought wow this is me.. I have always been this way.... And I never fully understand my discomfort and this is because I am not in touch with my emotions.. Alexithemia!... And I am so socially awkward and anxious and need to rest after socialising... And people think that I'm weird... Then I thought about how I never had friends as a child because I was so weird.. Always saying inappropriate things and accidentally offending people... I get fixated on ”weird” specific stuff and noone else is interested in what I’m interested in... And Im always cold and have sensory issues.. and I have to act a certain way to get on with everyone.... The penny has finally dropped!! At the age of 45.
I always knew I was very different to others. I didn't underatand fashion trends or the things girls my age were into. My food aversions were weird to anyone I encountered. My boyfriend who is autistic pointed it out to me. My habits and some of my sensory aversions he witnessed made him talk to me about it. His confirmation was literally that I rub my feet together to fall asleep at night and sleep with t-rex arms along sode the day to day things. Turns out I wasn't masking very well around him but that might be cos I was so comfortable with him right off the bat. Currently on the wait list to be assessed cos the imposter syndrome is very real right now. I dont want to self diagnose myself even if others say its valid. But id like an answer as to why i am the way i am.
"I was told by a former (also autistic) manager, that she thought I was autistic. And she told me why. It was a long, long list. It made me go ""...oh"". That was when I realized I might be.

But I didn't know for sure until a few years after (despite all my research making things fall into place left and right for me) when I went to a big event. I watched introverts with social anxiety make small talk with strangers, while all I wanted to do was crawl under the table and I was actively running from strangers when they approached me. Then loud music started blasting out of nowhere and I burst into tears and rocked back and forth, and had to be rushed out to avoid making a scene - while the introverts with social anxiety didn't cry, and said they could have stayed a while longer before they really felt the need to go home and recharge. And that's when it finally clicked, that I was not just an introvert with social anxiety, that there was something more drastic going on for me, and that it had to be autism.

I went for my official diagnosis immediately after that."
"I don't have an official diagnosis--so take this with a grain of salt--but my mother always suspected I was neurodivergent. I went to a few child psychologists, but they always told her that I was a normal child. Consequently, I gradually came to the conclusion that I could be high-masking. MBTI was popular in middle school, so I found some help (INTJ according to several tries in different settings and times) with that, but I always felt like I didn't really understand myself. Despite the many achievements I had in school, I still struggled with social interaction and felt drained often. This sub appeared in my feed one day, leading me down a rabbit hole. Many of the posts on here and what information I could find on autism in women resonated with me. While an official diagnosis could provide me with some validation, for me,  the benefits would not be worth the repercussions having an autism diagnosis could bring."
"When I moved onto my own I noticed that I was sometimes unable to do things, everything got exhausting so fast without any help. Eventually my friend now bf told me I might be on the spectrum, and since then I've learned to unmask a bit more and with help I'm able to feel relatively normal again aside from work."
"I always knew I was different, and while I have been hurt deeply, my honesty/genuine personality and ability to accept a variety of people for all their flaws and differences has led to me making many friends. 

My kids were both diagnosed because I noticed they were struggling with a lot of sensory issues and social struggles that affected their ability to make and keep friends. These problems were ones I also encountered but it seems like nowadays there’s just a lot more mean kids and far fewer kids who aren’t assholes. Maybe it’s just that more Nt people have kids in my area and they are more likely to teach their kids to be judgmental and cruel?

Anyway, I was 0% surprised when the kids were diagnosed and most of the evaluators were really shocked at how they exhibited a lot of autistic behaviors without a lot of the violent or emotional meltdowns they saw in other patients. But.  Like.  Our home is a sensory paradise specifically curated and designed by myself and my partner, both of whom are ND. And we largely approach issues that our kids face with empathy and knowledge that they’re not doing those behaviors to be “difficult”. 

So yeah. But when I asked my parents about whether they thought all my “odd behaviors” and issues with socializing ever made them think I ought to be evaluated, they nonchalantly told me that they had gotten me diagnosed as autistic back in kindergarten, but decided I didn’t need “accommodations” because “they would have made you lazy” and “we never got accommodated in our day and we turned out fine!”

And “but you’re not [r-word], so we just ignored it.”

So yeah. I didn’t tell them about my kids. They’d probably try to convince me to remove support because “they’re going to be lazy and have a label!”"
"Yeah, there was a moment. I was post-breakdown and fully in burnout, and I was and trying to figure out why I am the way I am. I'd been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 (which felt right) and BPD (which felt wrong). I stumbled upon [this page](https://taniaannmarshall.wpcomstaging.com/2013/03/26/moving-towards-a-female-profile-the-unique-characteristics-abilities-and-talents-of-asperwomen-adult-women-with-asperger-syndrome/), and when I read it, it was like a lightbulb went on over my head, and a lot of things about my life made sense. That was when it clicked. This was during the middle of the night, and I had to run to my husband, who was sleeping, to tell him I figured out I might be autistic. His response was ""I know."" Apparently he'd figured it out a while ago, and had been trying to get me to realize it by dropping hints into conversations. Of course, because they were *hints* I never picked up on it, LOL. Anyway, I was diagnosed a couple of years later (after being on a waitlist for quite some time)."
"One day when I was 19 I was doing a puzzle in a cafe when someone tried to talk to me. I remember thinking, ""wow, why do I hate eye contact so much?"" Quick google search later and I snowballed. Like the scene in Ratatoullie when the head chef reads the will."
"I had a feedback report from about 10x colleagues at work for a course I was doing. Every single person said I struggle to manage my emotions at work. That was the trigger that made me go “huh… i had no idea that my emotions were so obvious to everyone”. I still didn’t realise it then, but it was a trigger to thinking about this inability to mask my feelings. 

I then had to do a work course on active listening and started to really dwell on how much I hate eye contact and have to put so much energy into it, plus smiling and other appropriate body language. Still didn’t twig. 

Then I listened to Fern Brady’s book and went “oh shit”."
"I have three autistic kids. Then, last year, a friend recommended Unmasking Autism and I listened to the audiobook."
"sensory issues, repetitive behaviours/stimming. was in denial but kindof considering the possibility. then a therapist said I seemed autistic even tho I hadn’t said anything abt it."
My experience is similar to most everyone here. I just realized I wasn’t happy and couldn’t figure out why. I attributed it to childhood trauma for so long and just genuinely thought I might be a terrible and awkward person. Then I met someone who had just been diagnosed with autism. The more I met with them and got to know them I realized how similar we are and brought it up to my therapist who agreed I was likely on the spectrum. I realized then that I’m just extremely good at masking and I’m that’s why I’m always exhausted and not in a good mood. I was never letting myself just be. I was always afraid of upsetting those around me. The more I learn the more sense it makes to me.
"A very good friend of 8 years told me she was autistic and time stopped lol (we are very good friends because we have the same views on pretty much everything and think the same way).

She told me she’d always assumed I was autistic too, the whole time she’d known me 😂

I had zero clue. At all. Didn’t even consider it. Now, 12 months later I’m like “how the hell did I NOT know this?” (well, I know why but like 😳😳😳)"
"I've felt like an alien all of my life, chronic anxiety since birth that ended with extreme panic disorder and agoraphobia in my early 20's. Two and a half years in a pause, then I got better and had an autistic burnout two years later. That made me search for a diagnosis I already knew was positive. 
Oh, and the absurd amount of bullying EVERYWHERE. 
I just knew since I was a teen 🤷🏽‍♀️"
"Someone at work told me that they were super grateful to have another autistic woman to confide in.  And I was like, oh that’s cool!  Who?

And they were like.  Ummm.  You do know you have autism, right?   They gave me a couple books, and things just started making sense."
"During my son's assessment, it made me remember a lot of things and I kept saying ""but that's normal, right? everyone does that... I mean that's just what my childhood was like!""... well, afterwards his doctor suggested I should get evaluated, because apparently it's not, unless you're also autistic

I felt a bit like a fraud until I was asked to take the masking test (CAT-Q) during my assessment, where I also felt that everyone does that, right? copying and adapting to the person I'm talking to? pretending to be ""normal"" and studying human behavior, I mean that's why everyone is a self-proclaimed weirdo online, right? that's what everyone does? well, again, no, unless you're autistic 🤷🏽‍♀️

I felt like other people saw it long before I did, I didn't question myself until my son's behavior was marked as something to be studied, and it was so normal for me! because I was the same way, and also my brother, and it was accepted when we were children because that's just what my dad was like... well, my son's diagnosis started a chain of diagnosis, and it turns out that ""everyone is a little autistic"" is true in my family, we're all ND"
"My teen son got me a hat that said, “Be patient with me; I am autistic.”  I handed it back but then he said, “You know when some offers you a breath mint, that you should take it???” and handed me the hat again.   


Then my other teen son went to college and said, “So many of my classmates are autistic and now I can say without a doubt that you are, too.”

  
Now, that was not enough for me so it took my therapist bringing it up multiple times over several years."
"When we were going through getting my daughter diagnosed and I kept saying ""but that is normal"" Turns out I am autistic and so is my mom and grandma."
A therapist told me it would be harmful to me for her to treat my ocd in the same way of treating neurotypical people
"I had the thought back in 2019/2020. Covid happened and I thrived (mostly) in lockdown. I managed to keep the house clean as my parents still worked and my little brother was still going part time to daycare (he has much more of the social needs then the rest of us tbh) 

Around 2022 I joined TikTok, and the algorithm started practically screaming it to me, after way too many “hmmm that sounds like me” moments I started researching about autism. Didn’t fit it all, but a good 80-90%, then adhd popped up on my research radar and how it overlaps. And boom there’s the rest of my behaviors and issues. 

Was talking to my bestie a few months after beginning down the rabbit hole and her response was “yeah….i thought you might be…” and after that mentioned it to a couple close co-workers who basically said “oh…you didn’t know?” 

I now have a 3 page doc of how I fit the dsm criteria and my signs/symptoms/etc. plus my family history of autism, well that just sealed the deal (grandma and grandpa-both autistic, for sure, plus dad-autism, and mom-adhd)I did decide to forgo formal diagnosis for now, as I don’t have the money, nor do I feel like hearing the docs potentially going “so yeah your autistic, but you made it this far without the diagnosis so we’re not gonna give you that”"
"I said to my new therapist, ""I just hate talking to people and I don't care at all about small talk in the office, and I don't know how to make myself care."" I thought I was reporting apathy, but she used it as a jumping off point for a series of questions before issuing her diagnosis. Then we had a fun volley of ""wait so everyone doesn't X?"" ""nope, just people on the spectrum"""
"I learned I was masking first. Thought I was just masking depression. And although I do, it goes much deeper than that. It was a slow unfurling of information gathered from several places in my personal search for what the hell was wrong with me and why nobody has been able to help despite 12 years of therapy and a lot of self work too.

 Reading a chart in Jenara Nerenberg's book, Divergent Mind, I saw myself so closely on 3 pages of discussion points that it literally shocked me. I immediately sent the list to my mom who said, Everyone can relate to some of that. My response was, *But, all of it!?*
🤣 

That drove me to get tested, as it brought all the info I had piece-mealed together into stark light.

I am going to have shocking revelations, I imagine, as long as I continue to learn. For instance, the interview for assessment felt like this guy knew my every secret from birth til now. It was like a gentle calling out on all the things I considered ""abhorrent behaviors"" (aka the stuff I was hiding that I didn't know I was hiding). I felt like a child in that overstuffed chair (they must do this on purpose, right?) but I really liked the interviewer so I felt safe. So lucky for that. 

I'm wobbly with it all. Like a baby fawn, but that has a lot to do with the burnout and a hysterectomy I am feeling regretful and saddened over. So it is a lot to unpack. I was diagnosed about a month ago. I am excited for when I have the energy to really dig in and learn as much as I can about autism. My poor brain won't cooperate for long periods of time rn. 

So to make a long response even longer, I also have periods where I'm like, Maybe the assessors were wrong. I don't think so. I think they were spot on but will know more when I get the report. But my prescriber is pressing me on why they think I'm autistic. I'm like I dont know I havent seen the report. Smh. 

All this is to say, this is my road in my search for truth. This feels like truth and that is a wonderful feeling. But it is also overwhelming and frightening, and each one of our experiences is unique and frought with its own struggles and its own delights. 

Aaaaaand then I want to delete it all cuz it probably sounds stupid but I am not going to delete it cuz I think it might be nice 🙃 and post."
I got sober. I would no longer consider myself “high-masking”. Alcohol was doing most of the heavy lifting for me and I didn’t realize it until I didn’t have it. Now it’s all too apparent how much I don’t fit in when I find myself in social situations.
The good old “my child is autistic wait a minute” pipeline.
"Psych 101 when everyone self diagnosed. Autism leaped off the page but this was based on DSM IV (I think) so the outdated mandatory criteria (white, male, trains) didn’t fit. Kept going back to it until I came across a paper about diagnoses in women. Everything (and I mean everything) started to make sense. Every other line was “that’s not normal??!” Considered high functioning and learned to “behave” aka mask from early so I coast. But it’s a lot."
"I went to a psychiatrist because of pervasive suicidal ideation. We talked for about 30 minutes and then she started asking me a bunch of ""random"" questions, which I know now were the AQ-50. She also had me read a picture book and some comic strips to her and asked me a LOT of questions about my childhood. 

Then she told me I probably was autistic and referred me for a full formal assessment."
"Called rigid by my mom’s therapist at 14. 

Called autistic by my long-term boyfriend in my early 20s (he was part kidding and this was around when that movie with that British actor about Asperger’s came out).  

 Around that time, had my dad send me an email with an article about hsps, commenting on how much that was like me.  

Had a lady at a job in my early-30s who was kind of weird and not the nicest (in that she was very direct and no nonsense but not mean), but seemed to take a shine to me and I got along with very well, despite that being so rare for me with people. We became Facebook friends, and a bit after we stopped working together she made a post about being an autistic woman with a checklist of signs/symptoms. I recognized so of them in me and started doing research. 

 That was years ago. I’ve never sought a formal diagnosis ($, fear, and stigma), but believe that’s what I am, and explains so many of the struggles I’ve dealt with throughout my life, as well as oddities of mine that have been pointed out to my by others since I was a kid old enough to remember."
"Daughter was diagnosed. She's so much like me, it's nuts. Kind of easy from there!"
"I realized I might be autistic through a series of events over several months. 

First, I started relating anecdotally to people describing their ADHD experience online which opened the door to “omg there might be an answer to why I’m like this”. 

Next, I was diagnosed with PMDD in my twenties so I was looking at the PMDD subreddit a few months ago and saw a stat that something like 98% of autistic women have PMDD. Obviously it doesn’t necessarily work the other way, I could have PMDD but not autism or ADHD. Plus I believe it was one of those “small survey” type situations. 

But then, I started reading more about everything out of curiosity and (after seeing how much a diagnosis might cost plus the possibility of it closing doors in my life) I decided a couple of online tests couldn’t hurt for the time being. One of them actually asks if I’m afraid of balloons popping which is *so specific*. Like wtf. I can’t explain here how especially true this is for me personally because that would be very boring for you, I think. The balloon pop is just a great example of an unwelcome sensory disturbance because it’s a commonly shared childhood experience. 

Anyways yeah. That was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Balloons."
"I met someone that was diagnosed when I was around 18 and they were exactly like me down to specific childhood behaviour, feelings, trauma etc. And they told me I was autistic too which confused me greatly, so I looked into it and got a diagnosis too."
"I watched the movie Adam with Hugh Dancy and Rose Byrne and there was a moment he described feeling like an alien and few things in my life ever hit me as hard as that truth. I spent the next decade+ trying to figure out and then convince others I was autistic. I got diagnosed 6 months ago and I almost laugh now to think there was even a question that I was autistic. My older sister, who was really a bit of a second parent to us, has been particularly great in this journey. After some anecdote about our childhoods, she will now frequently blurt out ‘how did we not KNOW?’ And then we giggle."
"Instances over time just started adding up, and I mentioned it to my therapist that I wanted to get evaluated after thinking about it for a while. I've always had problems thinking of what to say in conversation, feeling butt naked if I make eye contact or being told I need to look someone in the eyes. When I was little, I did not know how to smile and was always wondering why everyone had a ""natural smile."" Everyone and their mother telling me I'm ""quiet and reserved.""

A little after I was diagnosed, it was still registering for me that I was autistic and I was at work at the strip club. I was in the dressing room, and I don't remember how we got to this topic, but I basically said, ""Yeah, I have to think about what I'm going to say before I say it, and if it's the correct thing to say."" Almost everyone in the room stopped and was like, ""Huh?"" ""What do you mean??"" 😂😂"
"When I felt the mask start to break and I begin having meltdowns. The meltdowns became increasingly worse and I begin to self harm by biting myself and throwing things. At some point I started losing the ability to speak when having meltdowns and would rock while crying. I went on FMLA and finally focused on healing in a safe place. During this time a lightbulb went off and I started reevaluating my life and the challenges I faced and realized that my “adhd” symptoms seemed far more severe than others I know and/or have read about. I also had been diagnosed with BPD and strongly disagreed with the diagnosis and there were still things that could not be explained. I found an evaluator, went through an evaluation a was diagnosed with level 2 autism on 2/29 as a 39 year old. 

In retrospect the signs and symptoms were there all my life. The sensory seeking, the social awkwardness, the neurological challenges, the periods of burnout and meltdowns, etc. I was just stuck in survival mode for so long that I didn’t let myself see this even though I was diagnosed with sensory processing disorder and a communication disorder in 2020."
"I have not been diagnosed, but when my kids were diagnosed I started reading about autism and ADHD.

As I read I found myself thinking , hey, I do that... I have felt that... I relate to this...sounds like me...

so, yeah."
"My girlfriend’s family is huge. Each party meant I would get upset and we would usually have a verbal altercation. I got upset mainly because the music was too high, people talked over others and on top of that: the parties lasted more than 5 hours. We are latinas so that’s a pretty standard for a party. That’s when it hit me: the rest of the people are not bothered and is not normal for me to get upset/angry."
"I kept having burn out but it wasn’t like a gradual type of thing it was all of a sudden just explosion of debilitating symptoms and I’d have to shut down completely for weeks or months. This takes a toll of you financially obviously but also it’s just so hard to recover from… or at least that’s how it felt for me. My last explosion was about 3 years ago and I ended up being let go from my job at the time. I’m a medical assistant and my boss (the doctor) and I got into a massive fight one night closing the clinic because I was so sick and tired of my schedule never being respected (that’s how I felt). I realize now that working in the medical field can be really unpredictable or at least that environment was and plus the pandemic. I learned how rigid I am with schedules and I honestly don’t know how I lasted that long in that job (5 years). 

Now I’m like piecing everything together and it really does make sense. I’ve also been told by 2 separate physicians now that they believe I am autistic (low needs)."
"I wondered how my friends could go through life without being deeply interested or obsessed with something. It made no sense to me— like, how do you just have surface level interests?"
"I first heard about HSPs and realized that everything resonated with me and someone mentioned that this is basically just autism. So, I know that I had a lot of characteristics common with Autism. Then, I let it go because I wasn’t ready for that yet lol. I then got diagnosed with OCD and ADHD and I started to piece together this feeling of being different my whole life, constantly observing & mirroring people who were socially successful and my sensory issues. And realized that it’s finally time I learn the truth on why I felt so out of place as a child. Tomorrow is the last day of my Autism assessment and then I shall have a possible diagnosis."
My mom moved out of state and I could stop masking in fear of being rejected from the family. I did it subconsciously as I healed from my childhood trauma of abuse from my parental figures. I did it as such a mode of survival I had to get to know me for me and not the image of what they saw. Now I only mask for the grocery store and that’s the extent of me masking.
"Apparently, most people don't have relationship rubrics, spreadsheets for their kinks, think the sensation of teeth on fabric is nauseating,or wear their socks inside out to avoid the seams"
Was in Evaluation for ADHD…. They confirmed the ADHD and strongly suggested that I would go to somebody specialized to get checked for autism.
When my brain broke from post partum depression and I could no longer mask or multitask.
"I've had random thoughts about it over the years but no one else ever said anything so I sort of pushed it to the back of my mind and ignored it. I always knew I wasn't ""normal"" but never really bothered figuring out a label for it. I just focused on figuring out how to cope and thrive to the best of my ability.

But as I've gotten older, I've struggled more. I've been in a prolonged rough patch for the last year or so that I am now thinking is a more of a ""burn out"" that I am struggling to come out of - extreme stress, anxiety, panic attacks, exhaustion. I finally got into therapy - again - and my therapist suggested that while I am obviously dealing with situational stress and anxiety, she thought that I might also be heavily masking some strong ND traits based on the things I was telling her in my sessions and some of the behaviours she was observing in me. She suggested a few books for me to read and that I do some research of my own, and that led to me to this. She thought ADHD initially but most of that didn't really seem to fit. But when I started reading about the experiences of masking adult autistic women, I felt SEEN. It was eerie how closely the experiences described lined up with how I have felt most of my life. I never knew other people could understand it so clearly.  So now I am looking into this possibility.

I am trying to work up the courage to talk to my mom about it. I don't know how she will react. I don't think she will take it badly, but she will probably be surprised."
"Having a child was the hardest thing in the world, despite them being so wanted and took years to fall pregnant. It was bad because I couldn't self regulate or do the stuff I relied on to regroup/recharge anymore and thus I completely lost my mind, multiple times. I kept getting diagnosed with things I didn't relate to (like *just* depression, *just* anxiety) which therapy and meds just never helped, I tried so many different types and kept getting what's called ""paradoxical"" side effects. Exposure therapy never helped either, despite decades of trying.

My child was diagnosed and about 5 years later, after another breakdown that meds didn't help prevent nor treat, I did a stim exactly like my child and suddenly had a lightbulb moment. I was diagnosed about a year after that."
"Disclosure: I haven’t been officially diagnosed. 

People from my close high school friend group kept getting diagnosed in adulthood. 

In 2022, I was the only person at work still masking and knew more and talked more about COVID and global warming than anyone I knew in-person. It was terrifying, important news that I couldn’t stop spreading, and I was aware that no one wanted to hear about air currents and room ventilation techniques. 

I thought about how Greta Thunberg has said that being autistic helped her not be persuaded by peer pressure to succumb to what was socially and conventionally expected, and instead to be unafraid to do what she believes in, even if she’s acting alone, to feel committed and steadfast. She’s a lot younger than me, but those are really positive experiences that I admire. 

I considered that I might maybe be autistic because I have always been stubborn and iconoclast. Just fucking weird. Doing things no one else is doing. Not understanding why they don’t see it like I do. Still being steadfast and continuing to do it my way. 

Then, a lot of weird experiences and quirks from childhood suddenly had a framework. I hated tags and elastic as a kid. My clothes never matched. I wore and wear the same outfit repeatedly. I want to eat the same processed foods a lot. I ate the same foods all through childhood. I never was able to keep friends. I was always picked last. I have a lisp and was in weekly speech classes until the end of middle school when insurance stopped covering them. Speaking a new language feels impossible. I never know what to do with my hands. I sucked my thumb until second grade. I bite my nails to focus and bite through acrylics, nail polish, and the gross no-bite shit. Everything made sense. Directives made me livid and committed in refusing to follow them. I make weird, loud noises randomly when thinking and resetting. I’m always singing the same fucking jingles in my head. I’ve had terrible hyperfixations and co-dependent friendships with friends I’ve fallen in love and limerence with. I’ve mimicked friends’ interests and music tastes, dated their exes in high school, and was way too dependable. I made an excellent, exploitable, side kick and didn’t understand that my behavior was cringe-worthy and didn’t have self-respect. I don’t get jokes and sarcasm. I can’t think on my feet. I have a slow processing time. If a colleague jokes with me, I can’t carry it on. It’s like a game of catch, and I always drop the ball."
"It wasn't until I was looking for answers about my son.  I heard about PDA and started researching because it sounded so much like him (17 at the time). I had never considered autism seriously bc he did so well socially from what I could tell. He seemed outgoing and comfortable in social settings, and I didn't understand autism very well at the time, and that social skills are only a small part of the diagnosis.  As my husband and I learned more and more and realized, ""oh shit, this is me too...""  it was wild.  It has done wonders for all of us to understand ourselves better now through this lens and it has also helped my husband and I see that two of our younger kids are likely the same and we can parent neurodivergent kids more effectively and knowledgeably now.  I just wish I had known sooner for my son. It makes me sad that we didn't know sooner what we were all dealing with, I wonder what could have been different, but I have to live in the present and just be grateful that we found out when we did and make the appropriate adjustments."
Fuckin trex arm
"I started reading about how it manifests differently in women and suddenly all my “issues” throughout life made sense, it was like finding the theory of everything."
"A close friend said she thought she was autistic and that was the first time someone close to me in my life was exploring that diagnosis. It prompted me to ask myself if I might be too, then the more I read about it (and I read a lot about it as is common haha) the more I was like... Ahhhh well this explains a lot. 

Especially reading the differences between non autistic people and autistic people. I was SHOCKED that non autistic people don't have scripts prepared for social settings?? Don't treat socializing as some giant decision tree?? Didn't have to explicitly teach themselves what humour is and how to interpret sarcasm?

So many things clicked as I kept reading!"
"I always knew something was not quite right, but when I talked to others about it, the always assured me I was fine, normal, nothing wrong with me. So I didn’t seek help. The moment I realized was last summer. I had been seeing a therapist to proactively help me through a big life transition coming up and during that time, we had my husbands family stay with us for a week. I had to be “on” (masked) 24/7 pretty much and cook multiple meals without really any time to myself or breaks. It was super hard and when it was over, it had been 3 weeks by the time I saw my therapist again and I told her how I had barely been able to get out of bed, couldn’t get back into my regular routine, felt numb and just so exhausted, etc. I then told her how I felt this just wasn’t a normal reaction and that it felt to me like a full-time job to take care of my mental, emotional and physical needs to just get by in the world. I told her I hadn’t been able to juggle a job and be a mom and never could work and do college at same time as I always would never sleep, shake with anxiety, often freak out (meltdown) and eventually would get very sick or exhausted as my entire world would fall apart. I told her how I always felt like an alien and that everyone just knew everything about how to be a person and I knew nothing and could never figure it out. Then that I spent so much time figuring out and doing the right exercises to manage my body stiffness and injuries, getting out in nature, meditating to deal with my mental and emotional health, supplements to manage all kinds of symptoms and studying how to be a better person and it was so hard to do all of this and still barely keep my head above water. She immediately made the connection although didn’t tell me exactly but mentioned I should listen to a particular podcast and next time we would discuss if it resonated. It was about highly masked autism in women and it resonated too much. I got assessed and bingo. At age 51."
"I took the RAADS-R test, got a ""you're a raging autist"" score. 

And then all those little ""quirks"" made sense: I can't eat certain foods, I have to do certain things a certain times of day or not at all, I get *ANGRY* when I perceive some injustice, I have three calendars I keep, I have never been truly motivated to please my peers, I cannot make eye contact, I used to tell my husband that I think I'm a different sort of person than normal people, if you tell me to do A Thing I won't do The Thing even if I already planned to do The Thing, and on and on and on."
When my husband showed me a tourette tiktok faker and it sent me on a disability fakers iceberg suggestions which contained neurodivergence and it's a long rabbit hole.
My son being Dx at age 3. His neurologist told me I'd better get checked as well.
My therapist told me
"I got kicked out of group therapy for being ""too autistic"" wasn't diagnosed at that point but that planted the seed and made me think."
My therapist (who I also suspect is neurodivergent) lightly suggested it. And after a good two months of denial and having to do a self assessment for a school project I was like ya. You’re right
My girlfriend ask me if I knew that I wore the same outfit everyday because of sensory issues … I did not
"This sub. I joined to learn more about my autistic daughter, and try to understand the things she can’t tell me. The more I’m here, the more posts I read where my reaction is, “That’s not an autistic thing. Everyone does that. Right? …right? Ooooooohhhhhhhh.”  
 
I do have ADHD, and I know I have sensory sensitivity and unusual food aversions. The longer I’m here, and the longer I work with my daughter, the more I look back on my childhood through a different lens. I’m not convinced, but I do have suspicions, and things that would make so much more sense under an umbrella of autism."
"In the early 00s I was in grad school (psych) and while learning how to administer tests, I kept scoring really high on autism tests and thought “that’s interesting but I don’t have the symptoms that make things super hard for people so maybe I am not autistic.”  I learned about masking more recently and it all makes sense. Of course I have the difficult attributes too, but learned very early to hide them"
"Honestly tiktok, I of course looked into it way more than just through tiktok but I started seeing posts about adhd and autism in women and so many things just clicked. I feel like I finally understood myself in a way."
"I lived in several big cities and it's not as apparent, but moving to a small town suddenly I was hyper aware something was off."
"For me it happened near 21-22, after a long time of questioning why I wasn’t functioning at the same level as my peers in a lot of categories. Up until then, I knew something was different about me but couldn’t pinpoint it and knew it wasn’t some type of mental illness. 

Elementary school was fine for me, I had the typical childish hobbies and made friends easily (pretending to be characters from cartoons, playing Pokémon, etc). Once I got to jr. high the socializing became confusing. No one wanted to play the way we used to, and it was all about cliques and trying to fit in. I literally had no idea why I was still getting teased from some people because I worked overtime trying to look good and fit in. By the time high school hit literally had zero friends and didn’t know how to talk to anyone. It was extremely rough. 

I still didn’t realize my other challenges with life at this point because I wasn’t in the real world. All of the adult responsibilities like taking care of myself without burnout were easy because I was a teenager not dealing with that part of life yet. Even school was easy because I barely had to study and got amazing grades. 

Then I moved out at 18 and suddenly had to work, go to university, feed myself, pay bills, and everything else that comes with being an adult. That’s when everything went downhill and I realized I couldn’t cope with life the way other people my age did. University required actual studying and I didn’t develop those skills. By the time I was 21-22 I realized I was radically different from the people I graduated high school with, seeing them all going on to take graduate degrees and finishing their bachelors on time. I wasn’t even really that good at masking back then, and I’m pretty sure it would have been immediately obvious I was autistic if I were male. I was just lucky enough to have pretty privilege and I mostly kept to myself so I flew under the radar."
"Meltdowns with hitting myself after having children, due to the constant chaos and noise. Then everything started to make sense…"
Having my daughter on the spectrum and learning more about autism holy cow how did my mom not see it
Other people with autism in my life were basically like bitch u need to be evaluated
"A psychologist gave me a book about autism, I was in treatment for bpd (dbt- therapy) Whenever I came home in the weekends I had problems with my brother who was slightly diagnosed with autism. He gave me the book to try to understand HIS behaviour. While reading it, I started balling my eyes out. It was the first time I saw myself fully described in a gdm book!"
"When Lockdown happened and i didn’t have to see anyone or go anywhere other than my partner i felt relaxed properly for the first time in my life. I could communicate by text or email and not expect to have to follow it up with face to face communication. On top of that i realised some people whenever we DID speak were just taking everything i said the wrong way, constantly telling me i needed to “think about the way i come across”. It just made something click in my head and i started googling why i was “bad” at life and communication. I found something about autism in women and it just made SO much sense."
"I went to a lunchtime work talk on ""how to support neurodivergent people in the workplace"" because my colleague was autistic and I wanted to learn a bit more about how I could help him. Instead I spent the entire session in stunned amazement as the speaker described traits that I had and accommodations that I was desperate for. 

Took me 4 years to build up the courage to get assessed!"
"All my life I just felt ""off"". Family members would treat me as an outcast despite trying to get along with them. I was an indifferent child,preferring to play alone,or help the teacher out during recess. I remember my mom giving me what I call a reverse curfew. I  had to stay outside for at least two hours. Didn't work,I just went to the library. This was in the 80s,so all kids were expected to fit in. I never did. As a teen I was teased so heavily in school. I just couldn't find a place to fit in. Luckily after years of searching,I finally found a job where I work alone. But I eat lunch alone. Because my coworkers bore me. I  don't care about worker gossip or your their relationships. I change into my uniform in my office because the women would keep trying to get me to have unnecessary conversations with them. No offense,but I'm just trying to either start working or get off. Various stages of undress isn't the time to talk."
When others pointed out areas where I hadn’t learnt to hide my autism. Each time it was pointed out I would then adapt to hide another trait. Then the pandemic came and I got out of practice of masking. I liken masking to exercise - you have to do it daily to keep it good and strong - use it or lose it
"I'm practically a senior citizen and I'm starting to wonder. Having progressively worse interpersonal difficulties at work. I took a free online test yesterday and scored high. I could totally relate to Sophie on season 3 of Glow Up. I've had a social anxiety / major depression diagnosis + meds for decades now ... and I'm like oh no, another thing?! I'm hesitant to ask my long-time therapist if I could be autistic, as she chafes at the idea of ""pathologizing"" or labeling myself. For now, I'm going to start looking around for groups and see if I can more comfortably expand my social connections that way. Stumbling across this thread here has been very comforting - thank you!"
I went to get checked for ADHD lol
"I felt like an alien my whole life. I felt like everyone else knew way more than I did. I felt like I was missing that piece of hardware that everyone else seemed to have. So I spent most of my life pretending to have it and burning out constantly. 

Then the summer of 2020, I had a bunch of friends get diagnosed around the same time it started getting around on tiktok for women with autism and realized it fit me to a T. So I immediately started the path toward diagnosis 

I got diagnosed January 2023 after 3 years and thousands of dollars lol"
"After being diagnosed with ADHD at 21, I started trying to unmask it. As I did so, I started noticing a lot of behaviors that aligned more with autism than ADHD and started doing some research on the supposed ""symptom overlap"" between ASD and ADHD. Lo and behold, I have both autism and ADHD."
"I was ‘peer reviewed’ by an autistic friend when I was burnt out and the mask slipped. I found Reddit, saw a meme about eating plain spaghetti, and that’s when I knew for sure 😂"
"It was the fucking NFL television commercial.

Always knew I had ADHD, but wasn’t officially diagnosed - like many women - until my plate became too full with executive function-requiring-shit and I burned out, then got officially diagnosed so I could go on meds. 

I honestly had no idea about the autism part. Like many, I had a really incorrect view of what autism is and how it manifests, especially in women. I dunno how I didn’t go down the rabbit hole before, as someone who’s read like everything ever written on ADHD in women. 

And then I was watching NFL coverage last fall, and they played a commercial, that I somehow can’t find now, but it was about the experience of game day - loud, chaotic, sensory overload - and then the beautiful quiet after putting on sensory headphones. Of course I knew I had sensory things, but I put that down to the ADHD. This commercial, however, explicitly referenced autism. And that’s the seed that launched me here. 

Getting medicated for ADHD opened my world up. Understanding I have autism has completely unlocked it, and me."
[removed]
"I saw random posts on reddit that really vibed with me without checking the names of the subs. They were all autism related. And first I was like ""no, that absolutely can't be"". Then I read about it. A lot. And it clicked. 

And now I notice things like I immediately start stimming when I leave any kind of social situation. Or when I'm alone and a bit cold. Or if I change the room. Or sense that I'm hungry. Or find something funny (can continue this for a looong time).

And I always felt like an alien with most people."
"About 2 years into the relationship with my boyfriend, he got diagnosed with BPD and Aspergers. I have been reading lots on these topics once we knew and realised that I have a lot of very similar traits. But because I was masking much more than he was (unnowingly) I didn't quite think I was autistic. Until I read a post about how autism appears slightly differently in women! It was me to a T! What an eye opener. Suddenly everything started making sense, even past experiences and childhood memories."
"For me it was when my nephew got his diagnosis, and I started really searching for autism. The more I read, the more I kept finding things about myself and my childhood that made sense.

Now not only my nephew, but my brother and I got our diagnosis as well. I still don’t have the paper from a psychiatrist, but I’ve been on therapy for two years with a psychologist specialized in autism. She once said it was surprising that I haven’t been diagnosed earlier. I blame the high masking."
I remember reading a list of symptoms of autism when I was younger and being confused as to how you could distinguish it from regular people. I think I settled it as a matter of degree and didn’t suspect until I realized that some people aren’t even a little autistic.
"A classmate from middle school “came out” as autistic on social media when we were in our late 20s. She said she felt like an alien her whole life. Huh, me too… went down the rabbit hole and never came out. Got diagnosed one year ago."
I had zero clue. My therapist is the one who told me.
"On Halloween last year. I went to visit my friends, met their new friends, watched them interact the whole night and didn’t even understand how their conversations flowed. I was so depressed the next day and thought those friendships were over for me (the were not, I’ve just been being myself more intentionally rather than being myself accidentally and ashamed of it). And every time I’ve cried doing the dishes or wearing bad clothes since then has only reinforced it. I still honestly don’t know if I’m autistic, I have ADHD and have a lot of autistic traits, but I still really never had that “clicking” moment. Not yet at least. For now I’m a tentative audhder"
"I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child but hadn't been on any meds for it as an adult, so I started taking meds but was still having a lot of the same issues. I started looking at ADHD related content to see what other people's experiences were. Eventually the algorithm started showing me AuDHD and autistic content. 


At first I swiped away bc I didn't have autism, but then I realized I related to A LOT of things. I started doing research in earnest. The more I researched the more explanations I found for parts of myself that I had never before been able to explain. You can only say ""I relate to XYZ autistic experience... but i'm not autistic"" so many times before you have to seriously consider that you might in fact be autistic. And now I know I am."
"I was explaining my nephews (16) autism to my daughter (9) and mentioned autism presented differently in girls and my daughter asked how and I realised I didn't fully understand the ways it was different, I just knew it was. I looked up a few articles about it and went... ohhhh noooo... it described me perfectly and as my daughter is a mini me and going through a lot of the same feelings and anxieties and confusion as I went through I'm in the process of getting her assessed. I likely won't get assessed, because I'm chronically ill and mostly housebound and mostly have a handle on myself (and now I can treat myself kindly over things I do/don't do that make no logical sense). I was questioning if I was reading too far into things because I didn't think I stimmed at all (aside from an extreme attachment to knitting and crochet to regulate my anxiety) but as it turns out I had never realised I wiggle my toes a lot. At first I thought I was imagining it or somehow putting it on because I'd been thinking so much about if I stimmed, but I asked my wife and she said I've done it the entire time she's known me and she just thought it was adorable and she could tell if I was fatigued because I'm less wiggly then so she knows to look after me. It could also explain why I was ridiculously picky about shoes when I was younger because I like space to flex my toes."
"I found out last year.. I’m in my early 30s.. needless to say I knew something was off but I always thought I was overly sensitive, sheltered cause I didn’t understand a lot of things, I weird and a obsession with cats 😅😂 needless to say when I accepted the diagnosis and started to make sense of my past that I had just healed… it was not fun and I’m still coming to grips with it.. but it just makes me upset how the system failed us & the symptoms was so obvious"
"I’ve been asking myself internally since I was about 12 years old if I’m autistic, not really in the literal sense, but rather in the way my peers used it basically as a substitute for the r word. Well over a decade later I hit a boiling point of feeling like an alien, and years upon years of intensive therapy hadn’t helped this in the slightest. For the thousandth time I asked myself “am I autistic?” And decided to actually look into what that even meant. Every single thing clicked into place from there. It was intense, a bit scary, and incredibly relieving to realize that after all this time, I actually was"
"That Sia movie came out (it’s called Music) & there was a big uproar in the autism community. I wanted to know what autistic people thought about it specified I looked up some videos on YouTube. The first one was by Chloe Hayden (who is adorable & went on to be in Heartbreak High) & the things she was saying started lining up everything in a way that finally made my life make sense. I binged a bunch more of her videos, then lots more research, & got diagnosed a few months later"
"one month before i graduated high school my sister (who studied psychology in college) told me out of the blue ""you know i've thought that you're autistic since you were a kid"". sent me down a research rabbit hole and everything suddenly started making sense. i couldn't believe she waited so long to tell me"
"I used to babysit an autistic kid, and he LOVED me. I knew when I met him that I had what he did but in a different way. I've always been obsessed with Autism and one day, in the middle of this 2 year burnout, my friend told me she thought I was on the spectrum because of my response to everything. She said it in a whisper whisper and it hit me that I had been diagnosed with ADHD as a child and the following week a friend who is a therapist messaged me and info dumped and said ""it's okay to self diagnose"". 

And here we are."
"my brother was diagnosed, and then my half sibling.. and then i found out my parents thought i might be on the spectrum but didn’t see the need to get me tested growing up. i also ended up studying asd and working in the field, and realised how much i actually related to a lot of them and now looking back it’s always been glaringly obvious that something’s up 🥲"
"Overhearing my parents arguing at 5 but didn't fully understand. My father was against testing and therapy, psychiatrists, mediation, yoga, etc because satan. He also made fun of my stimming or tell me to stop so I learned to not stim or only in secret. 

At 7 I understood when my mom would ask me questions about things I did sneakily asking about a diagnosed friend and if I ever did things they did. 

I'm 41 now and still suppress things."
I had a doctor I had been seeing for mental health bring it up after seeing them for a while. Turns out being overwhelmed in every situation for your whole life was a dead giveaway (amongst many other things ofc)
"I am 54 and hyperlexic. I was a very weird child and doctors started saying ""Aspergers"" to me in my 20s. But I didn't believe it, I just brushed it off. I was never offered any kind of support except therapy and drug treatment. I wondered about myself when I was in grad school to become a therapist, I met the DSM criteria. I knew but I didn't want to believe it. It was being online and reading about other ND people's experiences that I was able to accept my diagnosis, like in the last 5 years. I'm comfortable with my autism now."
"This is gonna sound mean, but it was realising that my entire life I have had autistic friends and actually LOVED them and enjoyed them. Didn’t get sick of them like neurotypical people. 

It was realising the peace I felt around them"
"This might end up a little longer, I am sorry in advance.
So: I was diagnosed in 2017 with (then called) Asperger's. My psychiatrist gave me medication, for emotional regulation. Maybe this and my traumatic childhood experiences with ongoing ""ignoring"" of my trauma caused memory loss, or better: not saving the memories in my brain (thats how i explained it to my psychologist).
Now, 7 years later, I had to move out of my flat, started university etc. I started therapy for my PTSD and started thinking about ADHD because I assumed, I was tested for ADHD in 2017 (not ASD).
My psychologist asked me to go to the psychiatrist from 2017 and get the official diagnosis paper, so we can see what he thought. (I didn't have it, because I moved out of my parents house after an argument and getting back together is still a process )
Turns out I was diagnosed with ASD not ADHD and yeah.
To be fair, I still see many ADHD traits in my daily behavior so I still keep that thought, but now I can finally live a student life, that makes me feel a little less exhausted in the end of the day.
Hole that helps 🥲"
"I had a mental breakdown at work. There was a build up of stress over the course of two years (one of those being during COVID) and I couldn't take the pressure anymore. I realized that life didn't need to be as hard as it felt. I should feel happy not consistently stressed. All I did everyday was go to work, manage to feed myself and sleep. I felt like I didn't have energy for anything else. And when I finally broke down, I decided I didn't want to feel like that ever again. I looked into it and felt my symptoms matched heavily with autism. Now I'm waiting for my diagnosis. And even if I somehow don't get diagnosed, the changes I made based on it have helped me enormously."
I work with autistic kids and have ADHD and plethora of stuff. I started looking at symptoms in women and I found some of the symptoms fit or mingled with ADHD.
"Genuinely, I kept seeing tiktoks on my fyp about autism in women and what the signs were/common traits/how it’s different for women, and stuff like that. Every time a video like that popped up I would think, “this sounds suspiciously like me…” I had an idea of what autism was but it was akin to the stereotypical male child autism where there’s almost no masking, you’re very loud, can’t be “controlled”, etc. After I watched those tiktoks I did more research on autism and learned that what I knew of autism was only a small part of it and that it can manifest in very different ways for each person. Especially for females and especially for adults. Then I just kind of knew. I didn’t have the courage to bring it up to my psychiatrist but she recommended me to a specialist without me even saying anything. then I was diagnosed!!"
"I told someone I didn't like certain food textures due to my ADHD, and they went ""ah.. maybe take an autism assessment because that sounds like autism"" 

Opened my eyes that day for sure lol"
"I identified with a lot of ADHD content on instagram and then the algorithm started showing me autism content too and I also identified with that quite a bit, so once I got a psychiatrist to evaluate me for ADHD I also asked her to evaluate me for autism (not an “official official” diagnosis but still a diagnosis) and she said I have it"
"I honestly don't remember? All I remember is autism in media was picking up at the time (all male characters) and sometimes I thought they were incredibly inrelatable and sometimes I thought I did relate. I just stared looking into it but dropped it until I figured out was masking was. My older sibling's disabilities were taken very seriously while I was told I needed to apply myself. I didn't even realize how my ADHD (that I was diagnosed with as a child) affected my entire life because it was treated like a simple quirk and never dealt with, so I'm doing it as an adult. I'm getting screened for autism now but feel like any therapy would be focused on unmasking because I'm just the worst people pleaser."
"When my eldest was being evaluated in 1st grade, I started looking in to the differences in how autism presents in AFAB and AMAB kids. I just went "" ... oooooooh ... OK... that explains A LOT"""
"After I learned the therapist on Love On The Spectrum was diagnosed at 35, I thought that could be me (34f) at the time I watched the show. I also started noticing traits in my nephew (who may turn out to be autistic) that I remembered having myself as a little girl. My mentee is AuDHD and we share a lot in common. So I took some screeners and they pointed to autism. My therapist affirmed it and I saw a specialist who informally diagnosed me within 25 minutes. I’ll receive a formal evaluation next week! 

I’m starting to unmask and I have memories of traits long covered up, coming back to me."
"When I was finally in a stable environment, and could afford adhd treatment."
"(Context: I’m not from the West and I’m not diagnosed) When I learned of autism not necessarily meaning the head-banging, unable to speak, intellectually disabled stereotype. The more I looked into it, the more suspicious my childhood and my whole life appeared. Then I talked to an (online longtime) friend about it and got “Yeah I’ve clocked you since the beginning (4 years ago) and just been waiting if you’d ever notice it. I just didn’t say anything because I wasn't sure if you knew what autism even was"" for a reply. Apparently it was obvious from the way I talk and show interests."
"When I realized regular people don't spend hours looking in the mirror to practice making expressions, looking at their expressionless face, playing scenarios, and practicing their lines......

It took me a long time like 22 n thanks to burnout from working fulltime for nearly a year. Plus overtime."
"People always pointing out how eccentric I am, asking why I don’t fit in or that I systematically won’t or can’t do it for long. 

People always complain I was too literal. 

Every so often people would ask me if I was an aspie and I thought they were comparing me to the Asp snake for years.

 They also complain I don’t show enough emotions enough or correctly (because how my face correlates to the emotions I feel apparently doesn’t match to the way other people’s emotions display???)

I’ve always hated loud noises and bright lights, always overstimulated around other people and hated making eye contact. I had selective mutism pretty badly as a kid and still lock up when stressed or in pain."
I dated someone who was autistic and hearing her talk about her experiences I later went a ha ha…I do that
"i first got the hint when i was 14 on tumblr, and started seeing posts about the differences of how autism presents in people socialised as women, as opposed to how it's traditionally described or portrayed. i remember reading that post and being like ""oh… this kind of sounds exactly like me?"" i told my best friend, and they were basically like ""yeah, no that sounds exactly like you."" internalised meltdowns, infodumping, feeling alone in my friendships and relationships, feeling like i was in a play where everyone but me had the script, were some of the things i remember resonating with.

i was trying to work up the courage to tell my mum, so i tested the waters by talking abt the vaccines and autism debate to see how she reacted. well, suffice to say, that conversation went… poorly, so i shoved the ""i am almost 100% sure i am autistic"" feelings right down.

i didn't think about it again until i was 20 and living in a sharehouse. one of my housemates came to me one day and said ""you know you're autistic, right?"" lol. that started me back on that train of thought i had suppressed for years, and a half a year later i got professionally diagnosed."
"The sensory issues that I learned to cope with (barely) was first brought to my attention as something abnormal when I told my therapist I was ""always in pain"", as if that's something any other 25 year old experiences. She let me know that it is, in fact, not. That was the beginning of my journey down the rabbit hole."
"I have noticed I related a lot to autistic creators in Twitter but kept dismissing it as because of my other known neurodivergences. Then a global pandemic happened and while everyone else was struggling with lockdown, I thrived feeling like I had some breathing room for the first time in my life. The sudden widespread availability of telehealth and curbside pickup were life-changing. 

So that made me start considering autism more seriously and then as I learned more, it seemed more and more likely. Then I realized my teenaged son and dad are the same way. My son and I are both diagnosed now and everyone is pretty sure it came from my dad, who agrees he is probably autistic (but doesn't care enough to ever get tested)."
There was a girl on TikTok who was talking about new age spirituality and how toxic it is (I was very deep into that stuff at that time) and that she’s autistic and then autistic creators started popping up. I realised I can relate to a lot of the things they were saying so went on a deep and long research and suddenly everything made sense. I’ve felt different and like if something was wrong with me my whole life so it was a pretty crazy realisation
my obsession with puffy coats :-:
"I was doing research in nursing school about adhd in women and how it can present differently etc and articles popped up about autism AND adhd in women and I started reading.

When I read about masking I teared up. I was still having issues with people in my cohort, not understanding their behavior etc “why doesn’t she like me?” “Why did they say it like that, did I offend them?” I felt like I was in high school again when I was 28 and most of my cohort was about my age. It all clicked then."
"when i wrote my creative writing dissertation my supervisor said that it was the perfect analogy for autism and assumed i was autistic (she is also autistic). when i said i wasn’t she looked surprised. two years later, bam autism diagnosis. i had no idea, but now post diagnosis it makes so much sense lmao"
"My autistic friend who worked in autism kept saying it to me for years but I had a very outdated idea of autism, and because I was so great at masking, had friends and a job I was like I'm fine I just have breakdown all the time and have to be hospitalised from burnout"
"Medical issues plus doctor not listening to me when I told them a medication was causing me serious issues, plus not knowing how to proceed to get on disability with a shit doctor so I went to work instead because I was bleeding money, felt like I was in high school all over again with the way I couldn't socially interact with them as at the time my health issues were so bad my mask was slipping. It turns out everything was leading up to a autistic burnout. It didn't help that my idiot boss had a shit ton of Osha violations that two of my co workers were just chomping at the bit to report him on so I was working in decibels and heat conditions higher than I could tolerate before I finally snapped.   


It's been shitty ever since."
"The tik tok algorithm snuck up on me and kept making sense, then my sister got diagnosed and it gave us the confirmation that we were actually right and weren’t just making it up in our heads"
"Had a kid, started seeing signs in him, then realized I had those same signs and more."
"I saw a pie chart that attempted to describe autism, and pointed out that people with autism don’t have to have every slice of the pie to be autistic. I knew I definitely had at least two slices of that pie. I’m pretty convinced now! (There were many other things leading up to this but that was the moment it “clicked”)"
"Burnout

The specific symptom that didn't fit in with other disorders I've been diagnosed with or assumed I had was losing the ability to speak at times"
"I read a post somewhere talking about the traits associated with autism and it got me curious. I did some research and realized that it aligned with me a lot. I put it off my mind for a while, but a couple years ago I was hanging out with my friends and we were talking about different mental illnesses (because we all suffer from different things) and the topic of autism ended up coming up. Both of them said I definitely seem autistic. I went into a deep dive and did a lot more research, thought about my entire life up till that point, and took down a bunch of notes and it just clicked that I'm autistic."
"My autistic sister made me take a test ""for fun"" 
Well, it was pretty clear after that"
Middle school or even late elementary school honestly. Kids left me out a lot and would even bully me at times and I got the memo quick that I was odd. I did research online to see what was wrong with me and realized I fit every trait. My obsessive Michael Jackson special interest got me a lot of bullying and the only other friends I could make were autistic MJ fans online and one neurodivergent girl IRL at the time. I’ve had issues with sensory things my whole life too that would cause meltdowns and my aunt suggested to me and my mom that I could be autistic at around 13.
"My son got diagnosed during my mental health journey and while researching his as well, it just became blindly clear. Plus, it was during the pandemic and the redefining that opened the door for many women my age to get the answers we desperately needed."
"This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJHa9xk16Hw), made by SBS which is an Australian broadcasting channel.

 I cried when I watched this the first time as I had been trying to figure out why I did the weird or odd things I did lol. I already had psychology as a special interest, so I went down the rabbit hole of everything around ASD. 

I watched it in 2018, and the autism community was much smaller then. The amount of information available now is amazing."
Had my 11 yo evaluated. Saw sooo much of myself in them. Met more autistic people and saw myself in them too.
Kids got diagnosed. I saw things that said hey just like me! Wait a minute…
"I was talking to my therapist about a childhood friend commenting on me having similar traits to her and her ""aspie friends,"" and he asked,  ""Well, do you think you might be autistic? Let's talk more about that."""
"my friend half jokingly said i might be autistic, we googled the signs, both realized i actually did   match the description pretty well. didn’t think of it too much but always had it in the back
of my mind.. then in the past year i randomly discovered the world of autism in girls + masking and was like oh wow, maybe this better explains why i struggle to make/keep friends, have to plan my words out in my mind before speaking, have always felt a major disconnect between myself and my peers, sleep with my childhood blanket and rub the edges of it to soothe myself, repeat phrases often, mimic other peoples typing patterns, etc! 😎 Yep. Scheduled my initial meeting for an autism assessment and it’s actually this week 😄"
"My ADHD-C was treated with increasingly higher doses of Vyvanse, but I reported some things getting much better (my ADHD symptoms) and some things getting much worse (my autistic traits becoming more apparent and me becoming more overstimulated by the meds). 

Also, once I got on ADHD tiktok, I ended up getting AuDHD tiktoks. We all know how that goes. At first, I was BADLY in denial. I dismissed every overlapping characteristic as just being my ADHD. Thanks to the many amazing autistic advocates on tiktok, I learned a ton and crushed my preconceived ideas of what autism is. 

Also, shortly after I realized that I could be autistic and really started to accept it, I burned out a second time in life because of college and a toxic relationship, and I started having full blown meltdowns again, which were dismissed as ""panic attacks"" in my teens. 😂"
When diagnosed autistic people started telling me that I should be tested😭. I thought it was a joke at first cause I didn’t even know what it was but I kept hearing it. Finally looked up some symptoms & took some tests on one of my off days last year & it stressed me out so badly that my symptoms intensified & now I can’t go back to high-masking😅
"My daughter got diagnosed. Once we got our feet under us and figured out how to support her, I started thinking about my childhood. I realized that my daughter was so much like me growing up that I didn't clock her behavior as abnormal. It wasn't normal that I was perfectly content to swing on the swings every single recess for years or that the Drs thought I had some sort of temporary deafness as a toddler and didn't begin speaking until 4 (my daughter was hyperverbal very young). It's not normal to be very interested in antiques as a child or a ton of little things I've since learned about."
"The combination of more articles about women and autism circulating in my social media feeds, my son’s therapist suggesting he is likely autistic, and Hannah Gadsby’s “Douglas”"
"When the psychiatrist diagnosed me by asking my mother if I wanted to be held as a baby. 
I never wanted to be held, I always wanted to talk to EVERYONE and tell them my name but never be touched. 
I have very heightened senses due to my autism and I love it for my creativity! I get Synesthesia it’s so fun :)"
"Bc when neurotypicals say really mundane things like ""you're so quiet"" or ""hey girl what's going on"" while I'm eating lunch, I freeze because idk how to answer those things without feeling boring/super obvious. Like, yes I am quiet, yes I am eating lunch, thank you for noticing"
I hit severe autistic burnout. I've had anxiety since I was 10 yrs old but when I went to community college I had even more anxiety. I also worked while going to school because I was trying move out. My body was hurting all the time and everywhere. I went through 3 different doctors and crying in pain to the newest DR in my early 20s to be diagnosed with anxiety disorder. After my huge wedding (wanted small but mom insisted) my back gave out. For about a year I could barely walk. I had to rehabilitate myself and got out of working in schools. Changed my environments to much quieter ones. While in grad school for SPED I realized that the classes and my job were helping me. Right before the pandemic my husband and I had to move in with my parents. I was having issues with them and tons of anxiety so went to therapy. Was misdiagnosed with tricotilomania. After that I told my DR and wanted to be evaluated for ASD; they left. Told the new Dr to take off the tricotilomania diagnosis bc it obviously wasn't true. Then I had a new therapist after I had my first baby and I suggested I might be autistic bc baby does xyz and I've been having xyz problems and I just went to like a 5k people event where I developed hive like symptoms from the noise/stress even though I wore my loop earbuds. They referred me to a psychiatrist and ever since then it's been down in the books.
When my bpd diagnosis didn't fit at all with how I felt
"I'm a teacher. I kept doing assessments for autistic kids and saw myself in those assessments. I also do REAL well with those autie kids. My partner has a diagnosis and kept saying, you look real autie rn... and 2 months ago my son was diagnosed. I've not a formal diagnosis, but my kids' psychologists agree I probably am. His diagnosis is NOT mine, but... all signs point to it, y'know?"
"It was seeing others' experiences online. My creating a living space in my closet when I was a kid became a shared experience all of a sudden...I haven't been tested, but I don't need to to know."
"I had a baby.

The energy it takes to take care of a baby - you become their emotional processor as they can’t process things for themselves. I suddenly couldn’t do things for myself.

She’s ten months now and I’m still struggling, but at least now I understand why."
I had a friend at a previous job tell me they were autistic. Never thought I might be. We became closer and they started sharing things with me that they had as autistic traits…..I was befuddled. You mean not everyone feels like this? We would go and sit at a park in the dark and play on the playground and look at the stores. We are both in our late 20’s at this point. Talking about autism life and trauma and everything just clicked. As I sat there with my hands in dinosaur position…... A year and a half later I got a formal diagnosis.
"i was diagnosed at age 17. before that i was a nightmare: i was moody, uncontrolled, and my emotions ran rampant. 
one day, because i was depressed and needed serotonin, i decided i should go steal at a warehouse. of course i was arrested. when in holding and waiting for my dad to pick me up, i told one officer what i was experiencing and how i felt all the time. she was incredibly sweet & understanding.
before she let my dad pick me up, she told him ‘don’t be angry with her, hear her out’. that entire spectacle got the ball rolling for me to get therapy & lo and behold, ya girl got the ‘tism. i was overstimulated 24/7 which caused me to be wildly depressed and snappy. now i’m happy, my parents understand me better and i have the help i need :)"
I didn’t realize I was autistic until I made friends who are autistic
"I went to my doctor post mental breakdown after 12 years (over half my life at that point) of poor mental health. Cried and sobbed for an hour about everything that I always struggled with in no discernible order or connection or organised way. Had just started looking into ADHD and asked her if she could refer me to a psychiatrist, she did and also suggested looking into autism. The assessment was spread over four months and the end result was the most equally liberating and devastating thing I’ve ever experienced. Not because Autism is in any way a negative, but devastating because I’d spent my entire life trying to aim for the goalposts that kept moving and I’d internalised so much pain and frustration and suffering and externalised in so much masking that i had not even an abstract concept of who I was as a person anymore. The grief period was hard but it was bittersweet and it enabled me to move from the phase of my mental health journey where I seemed to be stuck in eternal misery, to the phase of hope for the future. It enabled me to learn how to be compassionate and kind to myself, how to temper my own expectations, how to advocate and verbalise my needs. It connected me to other people who understood and could commiserate and celebrate similar experiences. It was something I deliberated over for a long time unsure if it would even change anything for me but I am unbelievably grateful that it happened."
"I had a suspicion i might not be NT in high school, but i dismissed it bc I was pretty depressed at the time and figured my symptoms might be related to that. But then I went to therapy and was able to get rid of my depression, and realized some symptoms of ADHD were still there. So in college I began the process of getting diagnosed with ADHD, and while I was talking to a friend about it she said she thought I already knew I was autistic (she also has autism so it wasn't meant as a bad thing). So I did more research and yea, she was right. Apparently all my friends knew before I did and just didn't say anything bc they thought I already knew lol"
"I was watching a playthrough of a game with an autistic love interest and the couple playing the game started describing a high functioning fem they went to college with. And went in depth about the symptoms and how they can present different in women, and it just clicked"
"Forgot to add one of many lightbulb moments I had in spring 2023. I came across the whole eye contact problem. It took me until I turned 45 that April to realize that I didn't actually know what appropriate eye contact is. I take it back, not a light bulb moment. More being hit by a lightning strike lol. "
Having my daughter and seeing it in her.
My autistic art therapist hinted at it and then I had a revelation.
"I went on a meet and greet with someone I met on a dating site. When he said that he was a high-masking autie, something hit like a ton of bricks. A of a sudden the pieces started falling together and started making sense. What I have always called “playing the chameleon game” was actually my being high-masking. When I mentioned this to my autistic friends, they pretty much said, “Yeah, you’re one of us.”"
Read Strong Female Character by Fern Brady and I was like…oh. It me.
Started following autistic content creators and realized that I related a lot with their struggles.. then I start reading papers and studies about late diagnosed people and specifically women.
"I’m waiting for my autism assessment. However, I realised that I might be autistic when I was diagnosed with ADHD and started taking medication. Now those symptoms are more under control, a lot more of what I think are autistic traits are starting to show more and more. I think for a long time my ADHD, potential autism and GAD have kind of been counteracting one another. As a result, it’s been absolute chaos in my mind but from an outsiders perspective I seem to be getting by just fine. I have a lot of imposter syndrome about the potential autism, despite all the available tests indicating that it’s very likely that I am autistic and generally hearing others experiences with ASD resonate with me in a way that makes me feel so seen and understood. I think it will only truly click for me once I get a confirmed diagnosis (which I ironically think is a bit of a sign in itself that I feel like I’m lying unless someone else 100% confirms something, don’t know if that makes sense haha). Just my experience! Would love to know if anyone else feels/has felt the same way"
"The first thing I found out was sensory issues. I read somewhere about it and thought ""oh wow! I'm not just an oversensitive annoying woman!it's not all in my head."". 

Then a long time after I learned about adhd and thought some of the traits fit me but I wasn't quite sure about it. I have adhd friends and I didn't feel like I was like them. I felt like we were similar but yet different at the same time. Then somewhere else I read about how autism could run in the family (we have multiple autistic children in my mother side). Based on what I read about autism (the stereotypical autistic traits) I diagnosed my brother!!! He went and got officially diagnosed but still I had no clue about myself. Until one day I saw a video of a woman talking about the difference between male and female autistic traits and everything just clicked!"
Had a child who was audhd and started to realise they were a mini version of me…
"The moment I started realizing is when I was reading an article written by a high masking lady, and she was describing het internal process in detail. I was like: oh damn, not everyone does this?!! And immediately went on a research rampage on autism in women and masking. Deep down I instantly knew this was it (after 36 years of searching why I was different), but yeah of course I needed an extremely deep dive before I believed it."
"I had been told by medical professionals 20 years ago that only boys could be autistic so I never considered it, despite seeing several psychiatrists for anxiety and problems with social situations, being overwhelmed and panic attacks (which I now know are part of meltdowns).  I have 2 uncles and 4 male cousins with autism. It wasn't until I had my own son in my mid 30s who was showing signs and the health professional asked about my health history, and I told her about my many problems with anxiety and treatments that she asked if I had been assessed for autism. I started doing some research then."
"2 years ago (I was 39), I was scrolling through Twitter and saw a post with an infographic showing what this particular person saw as their autistic traits. One of them was ""listens to the same song on repeat,"" and I thought, ""Hey, I do that."" The next one was ""forgets to drink water,"" and I was like,""Yeah, but don't we all?"" I kept reading these traits, and something exploded in my brain. I threw myself down the rabbit hole of autism and did all the tests (which came overwhelmingly positive for autism). 

Just the week before that, I had an experience where a builder was coming to measure the house before starting some renovations. My husband knew I wouldn't want to be at home alone with him, but he had to work. The man was due to arrive at 1pm so I had my day planned around that. He arrived early at 12pm. I was so inwardly angry that he had spoiled my routine and that I wasn't ready to be sociable. When I opened the door to him, I just said ""yes?"" without any of the normal niceties. When I let him in he asked to use the toilet straightaway so whilst he was in there I hid in the kitchen and tried to think of how to behave, what to say...when he came back into the room I quickly put on a fake smile and became ""human"" again, asked how his day was, offered a cup of tea etc. I relayed this story to my husband later in the day, and he said I must me some sort of robot. He laughed about it but I found it quite concerning that not everyone had to take time to switch into ""human mode."" So when I saw the Twitter post a week later, a million moments and memories all slotted into place with an almighty crash.

I'm still too scared to get an official diagnosis, but I think about it every day. I have really severe pathological demand avoidance, which stops me from even picking up a glass of water when I'm thirsty, so seeking a diagnosis is very overwhelming."
"Perception! I realized I wasn’t perceiving social situations the same as my peers. When I went to college, I felt like I was going through all the ‘right’ motions to make new friends, so I didn’t understand why I wasn’t actually connecting with the kids in my dorm when we were all in new territory. I decided my perception of my own behavior vs. others’ really couldn’t be as aligned as I had thought if I was so confused and insecure about where I was falling short. Trying to find a reason and not knowing about ASD, Asperger’s came to mind based on surface-level things I had heard. I looked into it, learned what autism is (never really knew), and it kinda fell into place. After the first time it clicks, it just keeps clicking. Most emotional and the kinda nail-in-the-coffin one for me was digging into my childhood medical file for more answers, 8 years after that college moment - reading the written observations that landed me in speech therapy as a kid (never explained to me or really spoken of once my masking was strong enough to stop going), then high school learning assessments and therapy evaluations that ended with nonspecific diagnoses and follow-up questions, that sort of thing. It’s a bittersweet process for sure, and ofc ultimately socializing is just one part of it. Self-diagnosed, and more understanding with myself nowadays when things get challenging. (Or at least, I try to be.)"
"It was funny, last year I started making more queer friends. before that, my best friend of 6 years was (is?) autistic but i didn't realize it until after i realized i was. a lot of my queer friends were neurodivergent and one of them was making autism jokes. i didn't get why they felt comfortable making those jokes with me, and obviously neurotypical person. but then they said they thought i was very obviously autistic.

that kind of rocked my world, and i questioned a lot of things for awhile. i took every online test ever and scored super high, but i wanted to know for sure. i found a hugeeeee list of journals from a lady on tiktok, and i read every single one of them. at this point i can't seriously see myself not being autistic. also recently found out that i was diagnosed at a young age so my questioning was in vain. 

however, im still very high masking. i'm not really sure how to take it off, but it does slip a lot when im around my dad or one of my friends who is the textbook poster child of autism. that was my biggest hurdle, trying to sift through my brain and see what was a defense mechanism and what is real."
Working with those on the spectrum !
"Still in the self diagnose zone, but for me it was when I moved away from my parents. I got two roommates, had much more social interaction because of limited space and wondered why I was so exhausted all the time. I also witnessed how NT people work in their day to day life as opposed to the ND household I came from (my parents aren't diagnosed either, but I have suspicions). For example less care when making loud noises, doing daily tasks with an ease and naturalness that I still admire, adapting to changes in plans very quickly. I just wasn't used to all that and made me question how my brain worked."
Is it rare to be high masking and early diagnosed? Because I was diagnosed early (at 7) but I’ve always been a high masker. My first teachers caught on to my neurodivergence and helped my mom access resources and knowledge to help me. One of my friends had a grandma who volunteered in our first grade class that was a former educator and she pointed my mom in the direction of the first psychologist who diagnosed me. Honestly I feel like it was some kind of divine intervention/crazy luck that I was able to access such an early diagnosis. I am incredibly grateful because it’s done a lot for me. But it’s not necessarily made it so I mask less. Trauma from early life social situations and my abusive dad made it hard not to mask out of necessity. The same psychologist diagnosed me with PTSD a while before complex PTSD was a thing people knew about.
"I was going to therapy because OCD and social anxiety. I realize I was not getting better, I was just learning how to mask even more. Then I thought I might be autistic because sometimes I watched videos on tik tok, but normally I didn't watch them. With the time I started to watch and started to make sense. I started to read about autism and I realised that I am autistic."
"When I moved abroad, I spent alot of time alone. Also meeting new people, people would say I'm very quiet. But it was me analysing people, and who I see as ""safe"" to go and speak to. Even then, I wouldn't go do it cos I couldn't start a conversation. I was called shy growing up but it's not shyness. It's my inability to strike a conversation and missing social cues lol. 

But then people who I've been surrounded by, just love talking about themselves, which leaves me no space to put my input.."
"I am in the process of getting a diagnosis (of course I don't know if I will get a diagnosis or not/I am doubting myself like there is a bees nest in my head). 

* I have had nicknames like ""Freezer/Fridge"" in highschool, I have had people tell me I am as unaware of things as ""an ox/a piece of wood"". I worked at a hotel reception before and the assistant hotel manager was surprised how I checked people in ""like a robot, repeating the same sentences over and over"". 

* I do have specific rules (I must follow or I will get big mad) and my mother and sister were baffled when I entered my room and immediately knew someone was in there ""despite them putting stuff religiously in their right places"". I used to be also the first person to notice earthquakes, even ones my family would not be able to feel somehow.
* I have had only surface level friendships, my husband said that people want more from me (they find me cool, he said), HOWEVER I do feel so overwhelmed by the responsibilities of friendships? People say they don't have expectations towards their friends and they LIE. They do have huge expectations and I am tired of finding out what I can say and what I shouldn't say. 
* My social life is a big mess. I rather stay home do things on my own. Sometimes my husband convinces me to go out and do things together which also freaks me out at some point. I have a lot of anger following me in my life and after a day of 4 hours of work I take a nap/pass out. Simple outings have the same effect. 

Thing is I don't have meltdowns. I get extremely angry and have to hold everything back so I don't go around breaking stuff, breaking people or shaving my head (my hair is annoying). I also don't visibly stim which also makes me doubt myself a lot (I do clench my teeth and tense my muscles or touch my eyebrows until I get bald there but I cannot trust myself on this fully). Eventually after I was sick and depressed a whole month due to work/life stress I started wondering about what made me so fucking tired?! This question has lead me here. 

Note: I have to add I have met two ASD individuals in my life so far and having conversations with them was liberating. Like I can say things without thinking to hard about it. I don't have to smile or look them in the eyes to signal to them that I am listening, this stuff is not necessary. Also the topics we got to speak about were cool it wasn't forced and not boring or anything where I had to act that I emphasize with someone. I just simply do not."
"As a kid there was a running joke in my family that I could wear a lot of ''masks''. I tweeked my behaviour with different friend groups, acted differerent with lots of family around, had yet another mask when talking to teachers, my mom would even joke that if I stressed about talking to someone I just needed to put on the right mask and all would be fine. And of course afterwords, whichever ''mask'' it was, I would be drained of energy.

As I started my first full time job I felt like I got close to burn-out very fast, and started being unable to do everything that I was told normal people do (having a full time job while managing to keep clean or shower everyday. Maintaining friendships, keeping it together in social interractions without sutting down... etc). Then I saw a Tik-Tok video on masking, I know some people don't like Tik-Tok but it got me thinking, specifically because my family would say that I wore a ''mask''.

I learnt about masking, autism burnout, PDA, I learnt about shut-downs (I had only heard of melt-downs before), I just found people that I related with when this whole time I thought I was the odd one out. And I am not officially diagnosed, but re-adjusting my life with the assumption that I might be autistic has made it a lot easier to live."
"After my 3rd burnout in ten years. I had been wondering for a while, but that was the last nail.

I have now been diagnosed and recognised as disabled by the state, after slowly recovering for 2 years."
"about a year ago as i was battling a ""what the fuck is wrong with me why is everyone able to manage existing as a person except me""-phase, my girlfriend asked if i'd ever considered i might be autistic. my first reaction was along the lines of ""no way, i really struggle socially and get overwhelmed all the time but i can't Possibly be autistic, there's just something severely wrong with me in some uniquely pathetic yet boring way"", mostly because while i do know a good number of autistics, the only people i was comparing myself to were my level 3 autistic aunt (""yeah i have autism in my family but i'm not like her"") as well as my ex who was diagnosed like 10 years ago and who once said that they don't think i'm autistic, i just have anxiety. 

but then i kept coming across late diagnosed people online and what they were saying about their experiences just hit so close to home. the first time i read that a lot of autistic girls are overachievers and work Really hard on compensating for their social shortcomings but then often once they hit adulthood, life becomes so complex that the strategies to blend in developed over childhood just don't cut it anymore i started crying uncontrollably lol i was still mostly in denial until i remembered how i would get Violently travel sick as a child and i googled that + autism and learned about sensory seeking/avoiding and for whatever reason this was what actually made me think my gf may have a point (i do realise that this is very random and that allistic kids get travel sick too, i can't explain why it was this that made me re-examine my entire life). so i started looking more into it and ofc got really freaked out by the thought of maybe just making it all up but my girlfriend said to just try treating myself as if i were autistic and while that opened a massive can of worms, at the same time it just created a really weird level of calm in me too. like it's really scary allowing all the thoughts and feelings (and also realising i have absolutely no idea how i feel most of the time lmao) but this is also the first time in my entire life that i've been able to start making sense of it. i also feel like it has set off some kind of self-discovery chain reaction where every time i realise something about myself in relation to autism, i immediately figure out a bunch of other things as well."
"Every time I encountered or read about autism I felt connected to it or could very much relate.
But it never quite clicked because I just had this stereotype of “more likely to be boys” and “math genius”.

What really pushed me to look into it is when a friend of mine did an assessment of ADHD and Autism. She got an ADHD diagnosis and I could relate to her. Coincidentally a very close friend told me that she was researching Autism and that they couldn’t help but think of me. So this made me do the steps to getting assessed. 

Not that I think you need to be assessed to know but I personally just have/had a very bad trust of the perception of my experiences."
"I think I’m successful at masking but an autistic person would be able to tell. That’s by the by…

From talking to others, a lot of people realise when their child is diagnosed. I realised when I was working with autistic adults with complex health needs. I found it easier to get on with them than my colleagues. I was able to understand why they found things distressing and was able to meet their needs much more effectively than a lot of my colleagues. I don’t think you need to be autistic to understand but it came very naturally to me and I started questioning everything! I sought and received a diagnosis… However there are still moments when I question the validity of the diagnosis. Which feels mad to write now when I currently have no doubt."
"Spent a week living in a hotel room with my lifelong bestie. I was explaining the way I do certain things to her and she half jokingly said ""that kinda sounds like autism"" and I was like ""haha yeah it does! ......oh fuck it does.""

edit: in retrospect, I should have realised something was going on sooner, because I'm a teacher and ALL the autistic kids (especially the girls) would open up to me and get really attached to me."
"I had a burnout and masking became almost impossible.
Developed panic syndrome with agoraphobia (diagnosed by psychiatrist). 
Then I read an article about late diagnosis in women on BBC and something clicked.
Became obsessed, started to investigate and it made even more sense. 

I was curious because the possibility of being autistic never crossed my mind before, and I realized how misconcepted the average person is about the subject."
"My (grown) kids started pointing things out to me, and that opened the conversation and curiosity. All my life, I assumed everyone either was the same as me but didn't talk about it, or in some cases, I was just ""odd"" 😅"
"I had an autistic burnout and during therapy i realised some of my reactions weren't NT standard but were quick typical for NDs. I'd always suspected but I'm low support needs so never bothered looking into it but finding that the best coping strategies and fixes were ND or autistic centric started to make things click. Then coming here and finding out y'all have many of the same day-to-day struggles as me was pretty eye opening. I thought they were also just normal but nope, apparently we're special and different."
"My therapist told me that autism could be the reason I'd found myself in an abusive relationship. 

Then another therapist told me my social anxiety could be autism.

Then when I took lexapro for my social anxiety I realised I still didn't know how to socialise even though I was no longer anxious about it.

Then I finally got tested and somehow still wasn't sure if I'd get the diagnosis lmao."
I annoyed my therapist so much by bringing up potential diagnoses that she sent me to get a general evaluation done (I was 15)
"I let it slip that I had a note (in my notes app) that I had *jokingly* called “autistic behaviors” or something. Then my psychologist (I guess I went for the depression and anxiety that my autism had caused me) insisted to see it, and was like, bro maybe you should get checked out? I’ll write you a note for your doctor…. 

And then my doctor was like, dude why are you bouncing your leg so much, maybe we should check you for adhd while we’re at it. 

And so I went. I got diagnosed. And that was that."
"When I completely burned out and had no idea why I had been slowly getting here for years. Autism explains my life, not just the burnout. Now I just wanted a new chance..."
I started realizing I was adhd in my 20s but couldn't get diagnosed/medicated until 30. My adhd was masking my autism so suddenly my autistic traits started popping out
"My sister started researching a lot and we recognized it in our mother. Then we started realizing it was why we were so weird and quirky. 

I did a lot of mushrooms at one point and it left me with absolutely no doubt I am a high masking autistic woman. It came at a time of severe burn out and sort of gave me perspective on my life. Nothing has changed but I’m more accepting of myself and more understanding of a lot of why parent is how she is."
"i get very into a specific thing. for example, i used to be extremely obsessed with raccoons. i would stim even in public if i saw anything having to do with them. i would collect them to the point of hoarding. then, one day i just woke up and was like eh i don’t like them as much anymore. that was it. as of right now i noticed that i’m following the same pattern with bugs."
"The ""fake it until you make it"" mentality would get me to a certain point, I'd snap and spiral into depression, then start all over again. Now that I know that's the mask, I can physically feel myself putting it on, and it's like squeezing my body into clothes that are too tight"
"Well there were things that made the mask fall. In my safe space when I was getting burntout, I started experiencing things (going non-verbal, food restrictions, sensory overload) that I had never experienced before. It took a few weeks of insight and paying attention to my behaviour more carefully before I believed I was Autistic. Especially experiencing bouts of being non-verbal when I was so overwhelmed in arguments with my partner or after a stressful event, that was a dead giveaway to me.

So fundamentally the thing that allowed me to be my autistic self was a safe space. Before that, I always masked and while I was still having autistic traits (blunt, strong sense of justice, needing order and schedules) I couldn't have diagnosed myself without the safe space. 

And within a year I've gone from a high-masking person to maybe a medium-masking person (is that a thing?). I definitely can't mask as well as I used to and I don't want to try."
"30. My husband said he thought I was autistic (which he now regrets saying, but his comment made something click in me that cannot be reversed). I had a strong negative emotional reaction to his comment, then started researching autism in late-diagnosed women and realized I am VERY similar to these women. It has been 4 years since the realization and feelings have not changed. The process of sorting through my actual feelings vs. my behavior stemming from survival mode of the mask has been extremely enlightening as well as traumatic. 

My dark secret is that my whole personality was about being a kind, respectful person and I thought I was very caring, but realizing I have been masking as this as a way for people to accept me. This realization has been extremely hard to deal with and has felt like my entire personality is a sham and I'm not as good of a person as I pretend to be, but trying to discover and piece together my authentic self"
"1) Watching a documentary about autism with my husband; and at some point we just looked at each other and I asked, ""That's me, isn't it?"" And he said yes. 2) Watching my infant son and recognizing myself in my original mental form, the way I was before I learned to mask."
"Socializing was still really exhausting even though I liked the people I was hanging out with. People kept saying it would get easier and that I'd bloom in college, but I never did.

I was getting extremely frustrated with minor things (loud sounds, small setbacks).

Realizing how much happier I was when working from home. I had been a teacher for a couple of years and burned out really fast.

Still having to practice social scripts ahead of time.

Also finding this sub."
After the third mental health professional asked if I’d been tested for autism.
"No amount of masking hid anything 🤡  
People always clock it out"
"I didn't, a psychologist suggested it to a close relative, after we met and talk for the fist time, and that relative told me. I knew there was something different on me, but I didn't know what and that tortured me since I was a kid, because I never felt ""normal."" 

The day my relative told me, I just listened and didn't feel anything. The next day, I started to read about women that were diagnosed after 30 (I was 39 at the moment), and then it was when it hit me. I finally had an answer. I started to read all the books I could. I'm self-diagnosed and I am looking for a professional diagnosis. I know it will be a challenging path, but, for the first time, I don't hate myself for the way I am."
"The daughter of a friend was diagnosed, and I was shocked. I asked what the signs were, and I immediately got a chill. He essentially described me as a child. 

Of course I went down a rabbit hole and realized I had even more traits that could indicate I was on the spectrum. The special interests, the aphantasia, feeling like everyone else was living on another planet, the gifted programs, the stomach issues, sensory issues, introversion, childhood night terrors, etc…Then, of course I took the tests, and every damn test said I probably was too. 

I mentioned this to my family, and they all told me they assumed I was. lol! Including my sister, who works with children on the spectrum. It’s like it was closing in on me or something. 

The only reason I’ve not been formally diagnosed, is because I don’t really see a need to. This subreddit has really helped me not feel like an alien, and I’ve gotten a ton of tips and tricks here and on YouTube. When it comes to managing life in a world that’s not made for us."
"It took someone to literally say ""I think you are autistic"". I refused to listen for a while but the more I read about it the more certain I was they were right."
"When I got diagnosed with adhd I started doing all kinds of research. I discovered a ton of my traits lined up more with autism, but at the same time with the overlap I wasn't sure. I learned about AuDHD and it really fit.

But then I started seeing a new therapist. During our first appointment she gently mentioned that a lot I was describing about myself/my life is very much not adhd and sounds much more like autism.

I've never sought a professional diagnosis but after my therapists comment I did all the tests and scored strongly for autism. I'm pretty confident that I'm AuDHD."
"I started going on dates with this absolutely stunning woman who was 25 while I was 27 or so and she shared her autism diagnosis with me and how much it was impacting her life that she would be leaving the city we were both in.

Whenever I’ve been around people in my life going through things I’m less familiar with I start following accounts across social to learn about them a little bit every day in my scrolling. 

Months later and I was dating someone else more seriously I got served a tiktok about the self diagnosis test and for fun while I was in the bath I took it. I scored like 140 when the threshold I think was 40. That stunned me and it took me over two years to start talking about it because things were getting harder than they’d ever been in my life and I was struggling to just keep up. The thread that connected all of my struggles was autism. 

I took the test again a year or so after starting to talk about it and grieve and unmask and scored nearly 200."
"I had suspicions but I had internalized the stereotypical male white presentation of autism and thought it could never be me. Therapists in the past had told me it couldn’t be me because I “don’t have social issues….” when I brought up that I suspected I may have it. All the informal tests spit out results indicating a high chance of autism. 



In 2022 I realized I had ADHD when taking an Abnormal Psych class while studying for finals. Earlier in the semester I’d first suspected it but again, internalized stereotypes made me push it down. Eventually I made a master list of every incident that I could think of that aligned with the DSM criteria for ADHD.


So fast forward to late 2022, early 2023, I realized I could be autistic too. I read a review research paper about high masking adult women and their narratives (direct quotes) were my *exact* fucking thoughts. So I once again made a master list of the incidents and characteristics from the DSM for autism that I had experienced from as far back as I can remember (around age 7). 



I’m a psych PhD student (non autism research though)—Psych / psych research is my special interest! EVEN THEN I still doubted myself. DO NOT feel bad if you do, too! I also have CPTSD and have experienced SA and childhood abuse so going to therapy for 4+ years also helped me differentiate what symptoms/experiences were from CPTSD trauma, ADHD, and/or autism. I began working on the trauma and adhd but *something was missing*. Once I figured out it was autism, everything remaining made sense. Literallllly felt like the last puzzle pieces were finally completing the puzzle. I also have siblings who have been through the same trauma, one diagnosed with ADHD too, but they still were very different from me. It’s the autism. I’m the only one on the spectrum (as far as we know right now). 


Like many other POC women who have experienced severe trauma and are on the spectrum, I am highly masking. I recommend reading research papers detailing the exact experiences of highly masking women to help you see if you have similar masked thoughts, experiences, and beliefs. I *do* have problems being social, I just mask the shit out of it. The therapists who said the opposite were uneducated and wrong. Definitely look for 2nd opinions!!!!"
When a former coworker asked if I was autistic because I reminded her of her autistic son. We were friends and I was struggling socially at that job a lot. I hadn't even considered it until then but the more I learned the more it just clicked.
"It was actually really silly how I learned. 
So my older sister was diagnosed as a child and I grew up knowing all the stereotypical signs & symptoms. When my partner and I first got together I noticed that he had a lot of these same things (food aversions, social misunderstandings, sensory issues) and pointed it out/ educating him on autism. After a few months of us realizing that he was probably on the spectrum, this man deadass goes “hey so all of these things that you pointed out in me, you do them as well.” And then pointed out how I do them, because it was in a way that’s much less obvious / stereotypical. So I started researching a lot more into how it can present differently & what masking is, and I was baffled to learn that holy crap I do experience all of these things. 

My favorite part of all this is that my sister and I are extremely similar people, not in personality but how we experience things. What bugs us, the way we enjoy things, our mannerisms. Her and I played as children by setting up scenarios & toys, then doing it again. We’ve had the same exact conversations over and over again for years. Yet myself and my family had absolutely no idea that I was also on the spectrum because I didn’t do the outwardly obvious things, it was all internalized and shoved down."
"Stumbled across a fair bit of autism information in my search for greater understanding about adhd before I chose to get diagnosed for it, and then after. I was still reluctant to consider that I had autism with any depth because in my mind at the time, whether I had it or not didn’t matter since there was no medication for it and therefore nothing to be done about it.

Unfortunately meds allowed me even greater capacity to blow past my limits and afforded me greater focus and energy to mask, so within a few months of titration I had completely burnt out. In trying to figure out what was happening to me because I imminently had an essay due I was trying to complete and just failing in a way I’d not failed before, I stumbled across info about shutdowns (which I’d never heard of) and how they’re experienced differently than standard executive dysfunction. That matched what was happening far better than executive dysfunction, and I realised I had autism and I couldn’t ignore it. So then I looked into what might be happening to me through a more autism-focussed lens, and realised I had just hit severe autistic burnout and there was absolutely nothing to be done about it, and I was too late to avoid it and just had to ride it out for as long as it took.

A year and change on and I’m still recovering."
"Honestly, my clicking moment was when I took a stupid online quiz of what TV characters you were most like and I got Leslie Knope, Temperance Brennan, SpongeBob and Linda Belcher—some of the most autistic coded characters—and my friend was like “yeah, it’s because you’re autistic, I’ve been trying to tell you”"
"There was a point in my life where i stopped mentally progressing and “growing up” despite doing the motions that would imply i am maturing (masking). I feel perpetually 17, and i call myself a 27y/o teenager. Once i burned out, i asked people if life was supposed to be this hard, to which i got an overwhelming “no”. Started doing some digging, found my people."
"My friend started dating an autistic person, and she told me beforehand as a heads up, and my first thought was, ""Thank god, I don't have to overthink and have small talk""."
"When I realized how anxious I get around high pitched noise , and that I rehearse phone calls"
"I was into mbti. Then there was info on cluster b. Then I found aspie spaces and a therapist left behind a brief test. It made sense. 

I'm not dxd though. It's not worth pursuing in my country. I'm not risking autonomy for validation."
"My parents always asked me ""why would you say that?"" When answering whole heartedly and brutally honest whenever people asked me anything 🫥 It took studying TV to figure out that people get offended by the honest truth. I also learned that studying TV isn't normal either. 🫠"
"The thing that tipped me and my therapist off was when I noticed that I use my neurotypical husband as a script-writer for social situations that I don’t know how to do yet. 

So if I would want to do something that I’ve never done before like call a plumber or use a text message coupon, I would intentionally ask my husband to do it and then listen to what he says so I can repeat it the next time I want do it by myself. 

Honestly, living with a neurotypical person has been the biggest tip off to me that I am autistic.

That being said, I had suspected for a long time. But my masking is so thorough that everyone I talked to about it was like “no way, there’s no way you are autistic”"
When I was questioned if I have sensory processing disorder. Everything made sense & everything I researched also showed as ASD. And then all of the ASD items clicked. It was like a cartoon light bulb over my head
My kids are all flavors of nd and multiple times over the years their speech or occupational therapists would say something about me being autistic as though it was common knowledge. Eventually it clicked (because I did not get it the first handful of times) and I asked for clarification. Apparently I don’t mask as well as I thought I did? 😅
"https://preview.redd.it/5v4o040oecpc1.jpeg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=816d9cd7d2e46afa9f7fc30dadac1ab7995ddd44

This is all it says. can find them on amazon I'm pretty sure. has worked wonders for me"
"When I started to realize why i don’t have any social interest, or emotional empathy. It was a clicking moment."
"2 of my kids have been diagnosed and since then I have seen a lot of YouTube and TikTok content that really brought it home for me. Ever since my first kid was diagnosed, I had been searching for info but it wasn’t until the last year or so that I’ve been able to find a lot of good information."
"Literally, I took an online internet test. 

But I have a background in psychology and know how to interpret and apply the DSM-V criteria, so that too."
"How are all y’all figuring this out so early?!

I was in my late 40s when I finally figured it out."
"I felt like something was wrong/different with me around 15 y/o and started doing research. It took my about 2 years to suspect it might be autism though. I went to a psychiatrist for a possible diagnosis and….bingo. 

I suggest watching video’s of the experience of autistic women on youtube or podcasts. There are also great books available that include female autistic traits. What did it for me were the books and one specific podcast (it’s not in English unfortunately). I was just in utter shock when I heard their experiences because they felt so similar to mine."
My ex told me he thought I was autistic as a joke or when he was mad at me and I thought adhd turns out I’m both adhd and autistic
"I am not officially diagnosed, but I am 80% sure I could be on the spectrum. A couple of years ago, I was curious in behavioral analysis and got a job as a Registered Behavioral Technician (RBT). Started working with kids who had ASD, AuDHD, ADHD, etc. I never had much of a grasp on their behaviors since I never met neurodiverse people beforehand from where I'm originally from. As I went with my job, I realized many things. They just seemed like normal kids to me. Sure, they had their own unique quirks, but I always enjoyed socializing with them. My supervisors noticed how well I got along with my clients with play therapy. I also noticed how dehumanizing the approach to behavioral analysis was. I was told to talk to them as if they were a dog, a high-pitched voice. I only worked there for 3 months since I could not agree with their methods as well as my safety being endangered.

After quitting, I started paying attention to my behavior. I have also started recalling my childhood and all of the signs being there. 

Here is a list I have of the signs I have noticed:
- Bluntness 
- Lack of understanding sarcasm
- Lack of understanding rhetorical questions
- Interest in trains, very stereotypical, I just find them fascinating (the experience)
- Interest in dinosaurs, very stereotypical, I just find them fascinating (the observation)
- Skin stiming
- Interest in patterns 
- Voice imitation / accent imitation
- Not understanding when I'm full
- Easily analyze numbers than literature 
- Dinosaur arms
- Tip toeing
- Cannot mask, being quiet is my way of masking
- Sensory overload
- Firm Scheduling
- Can't read people, they need to be direct with me
- Watching TV helped me mask as a kid, viewing it as an example of how children should act
- When I try to mask I feel like I am acting for a scene that I have scripted?


I only added this list just if anyone can point out I'm an AH or if they can relate. I also want to show it to a therapist when I get the chance. I'm sure I could be missing some more, but that is all I have written down."
"Honestly, a lot of reading and some social media algorithms, coupled with a drunk breakdown where I was honest with myself about my emotions and lived experience."
I broke down on a trip and came to the conclusion that it’s “not just social anxiety” and it went from there.
"When the sensory stimulation/overload was interfering with my relationship so much that I had weekly meltdowns (Autistic burnout? There is a name for this!??). At the same time, I was realizing that several family members are likely on the spectrum. It gave me such a sense of relief to allow myself some forgiveness for being so behind and just...off...socially all these years.

It was also the moment when I remembered a couples therapist who told me to be more ""relational"" and I was like ""What the fuck does that even mean!?"" It all makes sense now, and I don't have to beat myself up for never learning to wear the ""relational"" mask."
We took the RAADS test as a family so we could understand what my eldest goes through. My score was super high. This was January 2023. So much makes sense now.
"Multiple others I've interacted with who are diagnosed were usually much easier to get along with than those who are allistic. One of whom openly suggested that I had many autistic behaviors and traits and recommended I take the Aspie Quiz. When I compared my results to theirs, they were very similar. I had a nagging self-suspicion since 2017 but dismissed it until that point. It sent me down a rabbit hole of research and so many things in my life started to make sense when seen through the lens of autism. There are also multiple AFAB creators I found who were late diagnosed and large chunks of their experiences were way too familiar and relatable. Before long I had taken the AQ, CAT-Q, and RAADS-R on the Embrace Autism website and each one scored me as being on the spectrum.

As of now, I'm waiting on an official evaluation report, (underwent general neuropsych evaluation March 8th, which included ASD and ADHD)."
"As a psychologist, it's incredible to me that people that aren't necessarily exposed to research etc in this area are able to work out they're autistic. If I wasn't a psychologist who has been focusing more and more on autism and ADHD in my work (especially in adults, because this is where diagnoses have been missed), I'm not sure I would have worked it out.

I realised I had ADHD and dyscalculia first, because I struggle with organisation, planning, time blindness, adding up numbers under 10 etc, and working in every job I've ever had has felt effortful in a way that most people don't experience. I can present as organised but in the lead up would have prepped last minute, and was clever enough to get away with it. I did okay in school, but not great and I didn't understand why because I knew I was clever. In high school there was one point where I was failing maths but passing physics (undiagnosed dyscalculia), and I'm not sure how this wasn't flagged as something to look into. 

I organised an assessment with a neurodiversity affirming psychologist last year for an ADHD assessment and was diagnosed with ADHD. During the assessment she also screened for autism but only used one screener, and I didn't score above the threshold. In the diagnostic report she talked about sensory differences I had described being part of my ADHD profile. I now know that sensory differences are not part of the ADHD neurotype (and point to autism), but ADHD and autism are so commonly co-occurring that even psychologists and other health professionals working in the field don't necessarily know this.

I am social and have lots of great friends (most of whom are now also realising they are ND too), but I definitely struggle making them. I have a golden retriever (read: undiagnosed ADHD) husband that I likely wouldn't have been able to make friends without, besides the ones I've had since high school. I do have special interests, but they fly under the radar because they're seen as too *normcore* to be autistic special interests (fashion, Taylor Swift, psychology). However, people have often said to me that my Taylor Swift obsession doesn't fit with my personality. I guess I give off a *cool girl* vibe, and actual cool girls generally aren't into Taylor Swift (until more recently at least). I was not a cool girl at school. I was a horse girl in childhood but realised people wouldn't want to be my friend if I only wanted to play/talk horses all the time. I am slowly learning to embrace my horse girl self."
"I had passed the Autism Spectrum Quotient test provided by my professor for a training on having autistic patients in therapy. I hadn't considered it before, despite having worked with autistic children in the past...!!!"
"this except it happened earlier for me, i graduated college at 20 bc i got my associates in high school and i kept telling myself “it will get easier to socialize in college.. after college… at a full time job” spoiler alert it never got any easier, my execution functioning never got better, and the more i realized i was autistic the more the mask dropped and it became very obvious"
"This, diagnosed as a anxious child, and then with anxiety and depression since I was a teen took me till my late 20s to realise there was a cycle like nature to my depression every 2-4 yrs I'd crash and burn for 12-18 months, I've always suspected adhd and my sister confirmed it so im waiting diagnosis but along with the deep dive into adhd, came the comorbidities with autism and I tick almost all the boxes there as well so I highly suspect I have it and my depressive cycles were actually autistic burnout from masking so hard. Since I've suspected it's getting harder and harder to mask both ADHD and Au traits. I honestly feel like my whole life is falling apart, coz mixed in with all this is trauma from a abusive parent/s I'm stuck living with again, past trauma from my one and only relationship that was mentally and sexually abusive and ofcorse the trauma that comes from trying to just fit in, in this nonsense world when you have things like ADHD and Au, I feel like a big mess."
"This was similar for me except in my late 30s. I first realized that I had most likely experienced some childhood emotional neglect. I always struggled and felt different, but because of the feedback I received at home I thought I was flawed and just needed to try harder to fix myself. As I was exploring all this, I kept thinking that my childhood was still safe and healthy, despite the emotional piece. My parents definitely did their best and did a lot of things right. There had to be something else at play here especially considering that my sibling doesn't have the same challenges. I noticed that other people with similar childhoods still seemed to know so much more than me about life and relationships. The older I got the more noticeable my differences became. I moved to a new place and struggled to find my footing socially. I had a small but close group of friends that I had grown up with, but in a new place I realized my lack of social skills and wondered if I would ever be able to build relationships like that again. I was also still single in my late 30s and couldn't really explain why I struggled and was so hesitant to date. 

After a year and a half of therapy I gained a lot more self awareness. I started googling some of my challenges that I had just become aware of, or that weren't improving with therapy. Autism came up as a possible cause four different times. I started reading more about autism and related to most of the traits. I scored very high on the self tests. The Psych NP that I see asked me several questions and said autism is likely, but I have not been formally diagnosed."
"Same here. I'm 27 now, was 26 when diagnosed. 

Things that people ""grew out of"" I never did. I still like Legos and coloring. I still do crafts and hyperfixate on things. 

Tiktok was a big persuader in getting me to read medical journals and articles. I started getting a lot of ""ouch"" videos where the person I followed was recently diagnosed and we were SO alike. Then I started doing more reading, testing, and ultimately getting diagnosed. 

I've taken my mask off so much in just a year. 

They want us to be back in office 3 days a week starting in July and I won't be able to to tolerate it. After 4 years of being able to be comfortable in my skin, I don't think I can emotionally handle not feeling ""normal"" all day, everyday. (My coworkers are dicks)"
I relate to this a lot. Thinking that something must be wrong with me because just being in the office 5 days a week made me incapable of doing anything but rest once I got home.
"Haha ""that unshakable feeling that you're an alien and must blend in""! Love that one. So, so true.. always makes me chuckle, cause it makes me think of Roger (the alien) from American Dad."
"Same here, the algorithm started to randomly show me funny self-deprecating posts about autistic and ADHD traits, thoughts, feelings, etc. and at first I was like ""LOL, this is relatable"" and then the suspicion started to gradually build up. I found as many ""self tests"" as I could online, of course they don't substitute an actual diagnosis, but even with those I was getting way too many ""very high likelihood"" results, and I retook them many times across several months, too see if anything would ""change"" or if I was kinda doing some self-fulfilling diagnosis kinda thing."
"When I leave the house to go do normal people things, I call it ""putting on my human suit."""
"Autism has been referred to as, “wrong planet syndrome”, and I think that’s so on point."
"I always hear that the feeling of not belonging/feeling like an alien is a ND thing… but do NTs really not feel that? I swear it’s a logical aspect of the human condition haha


I do remember as a young child “knowing” that my brain would “go crazy” some day because it was so different from the others’."
"These little things that you realise later creep up on you fast. When I found out that not everyone closely monitors how much they look someone in the eyes during a conversation, my mind was blown. I thought we were all told to look people in the eyes as kids because every kid needs to learn good eye contact. So of course I would count how long I have been making eye contact! It gave me one of those ''oh wait'' moments."
"Oh god yes. 

I have lots and lots of  ""look at me, being all normal, sitting in the bus, doing great!""- moments"
"My thing for a long time was tamping down those traits and feelings with the internal monologue of ADULTS don't act like that. Now that it's clicked I'm like fuck it, it has nothing to do with how adult I am and I let my brain get what it needs sometimes without that internal judgement."
I really like this story.
"I would love someone to say that to me, I hate that people hate my honesty and it would help me open up"
I know he’s an ex but this is a cool cute story and I am happy you had that experience. :)
Do you remember the name of the article?
"Same. Got my kid tested, and was looking at the test questions myself and had a “oh. Shit.” moment.

I’ve since had to get the sibling diagnosed also, and while I haven’t sought a professional diagnosis myself, there’s no question I’m autistic and have always dated ND partners.

God knows why it never came up in my 40+ years on the planet."
Same  - it was when my daughter was diagnosed at age 14 and I thought she was the “normal” one
"Same. My twins were diagnosed and when the psychologist was explaining the clinical justification for it, I just kept thinking ""don't we all do/think that??"" 🤦🏼‍♀️"
Same.
Which book?
"I had a similar experience but with a TV show! I watched Heartbreak High a month after being diagnosed with ADHD and I was CERTAIN that Quinni must have ADHD because she was literally me, so I was dumbfounded when she said she’s autistic. I waved off for a second but then started remembering all the little moments over the years where I related to autistic things but “I’m not autistic”."
With You Forever by Chloe Liese was my ‘aha’ book! Then I read Helen Hoang’s The Heart Principle and I was 100% sure. (And then I devoured every other book by those 2 authors)
Which book??
Yes! The book!
"The deep feeling of loneliness, the unexplained aura of sadness. This."
"The deep sadness is so true. 

Also, I'm shocked at how pleased I am that at least one other person in the world used to gag at a specific color! There was a certain green crayon that used to make me gag so hard, but now, as an adult, it's my favorite color"
" ''a very specific color of crayola marker used to make me gag and almost throw up''

This is so specific and I love you for it. I had this issue with a single colour of play-doh (cherry red). It's sent was just a liiittle bit off compared to the other colours, and made me gag.

Also the big big feelings are so relatable. I use to think that I could not be autistic, because I don't have a hard time sympathizing, I feel everything 10x folds."
"Oh my God, I relate so much to all of this.  
That bit about the soul-deep loneliness hit me hard in particular, oof"
And that my depression and episodes of self harm are actually autistic meltdowns from over stimulation.. And I used to joke about how I wear a mask to face the world.. Because I actually do and this is a thing so many autistic people do in order to fit in. I have only learned about this recently. I always just felt like a failure and a awkward creep. Now I know and can give myself compassion
The anger is so real lol
"I think my five year old might have PDA and alexithimia. May I ask if it was consistent for you across people and environments, or were you able to mask? She is a compliant little angel at school, but just being told to throw something away while at home can lead to a meltdown. She's having her evaluation in two months... living with her struggles had helped me (40) understand I'm likely autistic myself, but PDA/alixithemia aren't among my traits."
"How can I learn more about PDA? The little I've read I really resonate with, but I can't find many resources."
"Hi there, just wondering if you know of any resources where I can learn more about PDA? Also is there a subreddit for it or anything?"
Can you tell me more about the feet rubbing and t-rex arms? I do this too sometimes. What is the significance of this?
"I had a restaurant manager call me autistic. But it was like not done nicely. But he didn’t mean harm and I brushed it off. He was a step parent to an autistic child. 


I also had a work trainer talk to me about autism and I was like wtf I don’t have that? And then he proceeded to use the recognition of my disability to try sexually harass me for months. I was so desperate to leave the job I took a promotion 2000 miles away. He continued to contact me over the years until I left the company."
"My dad's family has a saying that some of them are so strong-willed and pig-headed that telling them what to do is the best way to make them NOT do it. Looking back, I wonder if Pathological Demand Avoidance doesn't just run in the family."
"I'm also INTJ! As a kid, I've always hoped to become energetic and impersonal someday because I thought those were skills I had to acquire, and somehow, it was easy for everyone else. After 30 years and several self-help/communication books, that day never came for me. 😭"
"Hey! Me too! I was diagnosed as an ADHD-er around 4th grade, and I am also an INTJ, Intelligent which helped with masking. I’ve left/avoided the funerals of people I loved dearly. 

Great with dogs, not so great with people. I always thought that I would 💥BAM 💥 meet someone and make a best friend (really any friend). Didn’t happen til I was 40. And she lives all the states away from me.. 

I remember thinking as a kid, “God- I wish I could just BE NORMAL for once or Please- let me have a normal thought process for a day”"
Also INTJ. Just reread my summary and literally could be a description of autism.   How did I never notice that??
Another INTJ here!
Alsooooo Intj!
"Interesting, I’m pretty sure I am (undiagnosed) but diagnosed ADHD and have also consider bipolar 2 - what made you believe you had bipolar 2 if I may ask?"
Wow this is me too!
"Oh my god, this was me (minus children). When I did the CAT-Q, I scored definitively within strongly masking. I proceeded to do a bunch of other autism tests (RAADS-R, etc) and proceeded to be told by the tests that in no uncertain terms that I had autism, but I proceeded to gaslight myself into thinking that no, this is a normal person thing, that everyone thinks this way, that I'm only high masking because I'm female and grew up with female social expectations and all women mask to some extent.

I got my partner, and my sister, to do the CAT-Q and they unsurprisingly got different scores, and it was a very blunt invalidation of my unspoken hypothesis that ""everyone thinks like this"".

Anyway, it turns out, one of the traits of the tism is having poor theory of mind, i.e. real difficulty imagining other people can think differently to ones' self."
"Going through these ""but that's normal moments"" especially this week as I have to fill out questionnaires for my daughter's upcoming ASD eval. Like what's abnormal about spinning cars around? I think it's a creative way of playing with toys and thus have trouble filling out these forms as an AuDHD mom (albeit late DX 2023). "
"This was me too. Alcohol was key to my mask and once I got sober 4 years ago, the autism became very apparent! "
"Sorry, what is HSPS? I tried Googling but didn't find anything that might fit this context."
The story of my life as a boricua. Imagine not liking parties. Worst part for me? The endless goodbyes...
I’m curious what do you classify as an “unusual” food aversion? I’m still piecing a lot of things together and only recently have felt like people say I’m a picky eater but I feel like I eat a lot of things LOL
Also I’ve had other autistic ppl or ppl w loved ones w autism just straight up ask me if im on the spectrum 😭😭 this would happen within a week or less of our first interaction
Exactly the same.
"No soliciting, crowd-funding, selling, self-promotion, advertising, market research, recruitment, book/article research, product research, research for personal/business use, homework projects, or marketing."
Hi - would it be ok if I messaged you for a question?
"I have to admit that without my background in psychology/ research methods & consequently evaluation of data (e.g. collecting notes about experiences of other autistic people and comparing it to my own experiences), I may have never considered it to go after an official DX for myself let alone self diagnose prior to requesting an appointment for an eval last Dec. Too many data points made it more probable than not that I am AuDHD. The official assessment by a provider then confirmed my own hypothesis of ""high masking woman with two souls in one body, akin to Goethe's Faust."". "
"As a child, I was constantly told how mature I am and how much I would enjoy college, and I was convinced the ""intelligence gap"" I felt (which was more like a social gap) with my peers would begin to close as we got older. Long story short, I'm 24 now, and the gap never really closed. I always had, and continue to have, a hard time making and keeping friends, speaking in groups, and relating to others at work or at parties, even if there was a common interest."
Me !!! Me too though I honestly can't tell if my depression is cyclical or part burn out and depression. It's nice to know I'm not alone
"Dragon lady are u my twin? Ha! This is painfully relatable and I'm not smiling or laughing at all but for a split second I thought the irony was kind of funny. I'm sorry I feel our feelings might be similar just from the way you described everything. This plus not being able to get the therapy and support you need will make things so so much more challenging of course cause now finding tools and ways to cope becomes more difficult. I feel the cycle of self-doubt, loathing and fear is a lot more violent also. I personally realized that I start to shame myself when I can't do some things. Even the things that I really want to do. It's hard. N the constant attempts to dig yourself out of the mess somehow always go sideways so you fall deeper and deeper in anyway. 

It really sucks. N idk if I'm gonna make it really but I have to tell myself that I am going to anyway even if I feel like I might not. That I have to. I need to. N still even this isn't enough. So I'm trying my best to be consistent. When one tool or method doesn't work I switch back to another I tried before. When I remember something else that worked better I try to start doing that method for as long as I can. 

I'm doing all of this with the hopes that one day I can get an official diagnosis and the support that I really really need. Along with meds. I had meds for a little while along with my biggest stressor gone for that same amount of time[ around a month or more] plus therapy and I swear my life never felt better. So I will be spending the rest of my time finding ways to chase that feeling again.  Now I can only have my small fixes but eventually, I'll have it on a consistent basis. N that's when I think things will really improve overall. 

This is how I'm managing rn now. I've been feeling okay for a month. Still having trouble with focus and anxiety but other things are much better. Haven't had any major depression lows. Just my regular neutral mood.  Mostly only happy when I'm alone or with my SO. 

I try to be really gentle with myself especially when I make mistakes or cause problems. I still panic or have minor meltdowns but I can still figure things out  when I'm like that. I talk myself down. Discourage self-depreciation. N exercise regularly. I also drink st johns bush tea with peppermint n I smoke. Also trying to journal more regularly because I realized when I don't is also when I get really bottled and stressed and have melt downs more often. 

Still have all the other troubles tho of course. Often still very overstimulated. Lights, sounds, skin, teeth, hair. I try to make things more tolerable where I can. I am still burnt-out I feel all of my actions seeping the energy out of me whether it's talking, walking around, or cleaning but I do what I can and try not to be mean to myself when it takes me a long time or I have to do it the next day. 

I think we can figure this shit out. It's going to take different things from each of us but I think it can be done. It will be the hardest thing ever. I think there's still a possibility of happiness so I'm trying to get toward it even tho my progress is slow and scattered.  I wish you and everyone else who feels like this the best."
The childhood piece here is so relatable! Like I'd just keep finding ways to put my nose to the grindstone thinking there must be a time when it would all click. And it's not like my parents were bad they just didn't really understand  how I worked or what worked for me.
"I could’ve written this comment and the parent comment, I relate so hard. My parents were so emotionally unavailable and it kills me because now I see why - I’m pretty confident they’re autistic too and struggled to show their emotions. I kept thinking my differences/problems in life would get better and easier as I got older but I feel like I’ve been downward spiraling for decades instead. I finally started seeing a therapist about a year ago, got sober 8 months ago, and since then I’ve slowly been understanding more of what/how I feel. As I understood more I was able to really start looking into what’s going on with me. Thought maybe bipolar 2 and discussed it a lot with my therapist. Then one day I had a meltdown at the grocery story and another at the mall about a week later. I found myself in the google rabbit holes reading about autism being commonly misdiagnosed as bipolar 2 and the rest is history lol this past weekend my therapist referred me to some places for autism and adhd assessments🙏🏼I can’t wait to finally get help."
"This this this. My partner doesn't really understand why work is so draining for me when I just sit at a desk all day, but it literally takes everything out of me. Lots of my friends do scheduled after work activities and the thought of that has always been abhorrent to me, I need time to decompress every day."
Honestly I feel like he's got the human thing down more than I do
"Yes 😭 Literally getting people to proofread mass emails and projects at work ""so it won't sound like an alien wrote it"" lmao."
"I started saying, “putting on my lady costume,” and friends and family would giggle, not knowing just how serious I was when I said it lol."
"I think some people do feel that way when they're figuring themselves out as an awkward teen? But from what I've heard, NTs seem to grow out of that feeling. I don't think they feel like a *complete* stranger to life as a human, maybe more like they don't fit in sometimes, they're struggling with meeting societal expectations, or they're not used to their body changing. I haven't actually talked to a NT about this, though, so this is just an educated guess!

Also, same here. I always somehow knew I was different, I just couldn't figure out *why* or how to ""fix"" it."
"When I’m deep diving in to Reddit (just „discovered“ recently that its for me) I really don’t get most of the NT posts. I mean I get them but I can now see how different my perception of the world and my feelings are. When I hear people laugh or talk in the NT polite way it sounds even more fake and strange. As if now I am just the alien I am looking at the humans when before I was this alien in human costume trying to convince myself I am a human like „that’s so normal, I’m so normal, I’m NOT feeling weird“ 😅I can’t imagine that everybody feels that way. 

Though my parents (haha) tell me all the time, that I shouldn’t assume that other people (NT) have it „easier“ in life… well, they do…"
Unfortunately not. It was in the Telegraph several years ago and I wrote to the author. Then I forgot for a while until there was more media coverage and I started to dig into things further and understand more:
"It never came up because women get diagnosed with depression, dysthymia, borderline, anxiety, c-ptsd, bipolar of course, well - basically anything, before autism or ADHD comes up 

Our symptoms differ from autistic men, who are still the model in medical practice 

Plus many autistic women develop an interest for psychology in their teens which helps them mask really well. 

Until we get older and get tired of having more and more things that have to be a certain way for us to put up with life and we usually have had a few autistic burnouts

Vast majority of women is late diagnosed, most above 40, and often through children."
"Literally exactly what happened to me. I was filling out the booklets for my kid’s eval and I slowly realized wow, I’m pretty much describing myself here. This led to a rabbit hole of taking every test for ASD, monotropism, masking, alexithymia, etc that I could find online and every one coming out “extremely high likelihood”. One even said I was likely level 2 or 3. Autism explains *every* struggle I had growing up and every trait I’ve ever been called weird for. It explains ME. I’m honestly not surprised it was missed though since I grew up in the 80s when autism had a much narrower spectrum, but I’m happy to at least know now. 

My son ended up being level 3, and ironically being autistic myself makes parenting him easier. I treat him how I wish my parents had treated me as a kid and it just works. I understand his needs and issues, I speak his language, and he responds well. His older sister is currently on the waitlist for her eval, and looking back I’m realizing my dad probably had it too. 

I still haven’t gotten an official diagnosis either, mainly because our insurance only covers kids and I don’t have $4000 to spend on it, plus I may not even get a correct diagnosis since the criteria is still based on autistic traits of young boys. I am working on getting one though, my therapist is trying to find ways to help me game the system a bit to get it covered. One of her ideas is referring me to a psychologist for a different issue so I can try to get an ‘incidental’ autism dx. I really only want one so I can try to seek disability or SSI since I can’t work anymore(and so I can shove it in my mom’s face like SEE?! I’m not “just lazy”! lol)."
Isn't it an interesting aha moment! How are your kids doing? My kiddo is still very young so I have lots of worries.
"When you're getting to know a prospective date, do you use the A word or dance around it with euphemisms and/or descriptions of things you enjoy (or do not)? I'm cohabitating with an untested but clearly (to me) ND man. Unfortunately, he *does* have a sex drive. I'm ace, and really wish I'd known that asexuality is just another point on the spectrum. 

Hey. My phone got it right! Every time I type ""on the..."", it fills in ""spectrum""."
The Kiss Quotient by Helen Hoang! It’s a romance book.
I'd like to know too
I didn’t relate to it a bunch but ‘the electricity of every living thing’ is popular nonfiction book about the author realizing she’s autistic. It resonates with quite a few people and was a decent book.
The Kiss Quotient by Helen Hoang.
"I always explained it like ‘you know the blue sadness balls in inside out? It feels like there’s a big, blue-as-can-be one in my belly and another big, blue-as-can-be one in my heart and a smaller one in my throat’."
"LOLLLL is it the bile green one bc that one used to make me itch a lil. 

Mine was the mint green crayola marker… so vile .. so evil.."
"I know exactly which playdoh you’re talking about omg and I agree it smells like shit. It’s mildly sweet and almost acrid and mildly rancid. It tastes worse than the other play dohs too (I was 7 and bored lol). 

Yes!! When Katy Perry’s firework came out and she asked ‘do you ever feel like a plastic bag drifting in the wind, wanting to start again? Do you ever feel like a house of cards- one blow from caving in?’ I felt soooo seen. It felt like I was always yanked around by my feelings and they were so overwhelming."
"I swear I can feel it in my bones. It’s a hollow, isolating feeling that’s hard to live with bc it’s omnipresent- even when I’m surrounded by friends. 

It always felt like I was alone in a crowded room."
"I self harmed in 7th grade by popping a rubber band on my wrist. I would do it when I was stressed. I also had issues asking to use the bathroom, so I would pee on myself nearly every day. I thought I was depressed and emo, but now I’m thinking I was overwhelmed and overstimulated!!"
Same. I had an outburst today and it's my wedding anniversary. The day hasn't even begun and I've already ruined it. I really wish there was some way to control the anger.
It might have been consistent but I am not in touch with my own emotions so I may just start feeling anxious/uncomfortable/disorientated and not know why. I am very high masking as I am a nurse and so I have been trained in using advanced communication skills
"I have found SallyCat and Riko’s PDA page on FB very helpful. Also the PDA society page is useful as well. Nb this is a British website in case you're not based in the UK. 
https://www.pdasociety.org.uk/"
"its s stim. because of everything else my partner confirmed it cos of my stim as he hadnt seen any regulation behaviour or anything like that until that point. I've been stimming more often now im more comfortable . the t-rex arms wasn't just my arms near my chest either, apparently my wrists look uncomfortable"
"Ewwww, what a creep. Gives me the icks."
Wait me too 🤔
Me three. I highly suspect I am neurodivergent and several people around me do too. I am not sure how to get a proper diagnosis.
"Oh wow, I just read it again too. Be direct or they wont understand, they don’t like social rituals or small talk, difficult to get to know. Wow."
"I just looked it up and the first quote in that particular article was:

""Thought constitutes the greatness of man. Man is a reed, the feeblest thing in nature, but he is a thinking reed.

Blaise Pascal""

And it made me want to cry with the beauty of how simply yet wholly that encompasses me."
Me too!
Sertraline (an SSRI) sent me into a manic phase. It was fairly obvious.
"Crazy, huh? So weird to go your whole life and feel like something is wrong with you to figure out that’s not true."
Yep this was me in my 20s and 30s. Looking back i realise now how problematic my relationship with alcohol was.
Highly sensitive person - was at a theme park and had a couple drinks when I posted before. I added the extra s on the end to pluralize it.
"We are also boricua! Yes, the endless goodbyes are a nightmare. I’ve opted to just wave at everyone in a “goodbye to all” manner."
"I do eat a ton of things, but I have (what I think are) unique preferences that I keep to myself because I think if I said them out loud, other adults would think it’s odd.  
 
For example, my drink preference. I will suffer through a lot of mediocre beverages, but if it’s a self-serve fountain drink, what drink I pick depends entirely on the material the cup is made from, the shape of ice offered, if the iced tea is freshly brewed or the instant syrup junk. It’s more thought than I believe the average human takes.  
 
If an appetizer comes with multicolored tortilla chips, (some places have blue corn chips, or I was even served red, white, and blue chips once) I will eat all the white ones first and maaaaybe some red ones. Blue chips freak me out, even though I know they taste the same.  
 
Sometimes I accidentally chew my food too many times and the texture becomes immediately disgusting and I have to spit it out. I cannot bring myself to swallow it.  
 
I don’t like different foods touching on my plate. I don’t go so far as to use a divided plate, but if a restaurant stacks the entree and side dish, I never order that dish again.  
 
I think most people say things like, “I like chicken strips.” And I say, “I like chicken strips, but I need to see someone else’s before I order. If they’re the wrong shape, or have too much batter, or they’re too crispy, I will hate them.” Even though I love the “right” chicken strips, I very rarely order strips because there are too many variables.  
 
Yeah. Stuff like that."
"yes you described this perfectly !!! i was always told how mature i was and i struggled making friends bc i was always more mature than my peers but like you said it was really just a social deficit, and i’m 21 now and it’s still the exact same"
"Yeap I get depressed because I'm burnt out, the only way I know its burn out is i still want to do stuff I just can't physically or mentally, but if it hits depression, I don't want to do anything other than sleep and lay in bed."
So much the same.
"Tacking on my “I feel all of this/these comments so hard. I have no spoons to write more. 
Except I guess even when I feel like I’m losing my mind and actually just an a hole (icr what’s censored here) w/no self control I know I can come here and not feel so alone and misunderstood. Strength to us all. 
<3<3<3"
"The onset of perimenopause eviscerated any drive in me to be anyone other than who I am. 

It also exposed that I had never learned emotional regulation skills, which had always been concealed by chronic people pleasing. Oops."
">Plus many autistic women develop an interest for psychology in their teens which helps them mask really well. 

Oh.  ... oh. 

Yep, that's exactly what I did"
"All of the above minus an official misdiagnosis. Was a psychology student at one time, had burnouts too and got my AuDHD DX in Dec 2023 at age 45. Had a partial correct diagnosis for ADHD at age 43, a month after my then 7yr old daughter got DX for ADHD. Was without a referral, happened because I couldn't find an explanation for my daughter's emotional challenges until I came across ADHD. Got me thinking about my own life challenges. Got me then thinking more in terms of what if her dad was autistic, made me see red flags for my own autism sudppdenly months later in spring 2023. Btw the main initiator to look into ADHD was her and my EDS DX in 2021.  And ADHD alone didn't add up. Very sublime difference, e.g. experiences during intimate moments for myself (e.g. with soon to be ex-husband ) and yearlong observations about my daughter and her sensory processing differences and her stimming tendencies got me into seeking out an official DX last fall and now an official eval for my daughter. 45 yrs high masking, then ADHD med tryout NR 1 pulling off my mask partially spring 2023 + all what I wrote = becoming more and more myself & helping my also at school high masking daughter to get the full picture for herself. Plus more support of course for her at school hopefully (IEP is the next goal). "
Just read the excerpt available on Libby. I laughed; I cried; I got turned on; I got further confirmation I am autistic...and I placed the book on hold. Thank you for your service.
I bet you its the Kiss Quotient.
Same 👀
Yay it's on Libby!
"Thanks, just put it in my goodreads!"
"Somebody once told me that the reason they were attracted to me was the inexplicable sadness and depth in my eyes 🫢  
To me it feels similar to the way you explain it, I just feel it in my head so much. Like walking around with an aura of sad, or like a longing for something but you don't know what it is.

Edit, also the fact that every time I was around other people I had the distinct feeling that they were gonna ""find me out"" or see that I'm faking. Before I knew what masking was I didn't know why I felt like that, or what I was even faking"
Lol Yes!! It was like a weird chartreuse and the glide of it on paper felt like.. more greasy than a normal crayon? Cursed
I’ve read that there are medicines that help. I think for me it’s usually a combo of whatever the hell causes anger mixing with my adhd’s rejection dysmorphia and I have to try to reframe things for my brain
Thank you!!!
my partner explained my wrists look broken when im falling asleep
Thanks for explaining. Apparently I make some very uncomfortable arm positions when I'm sleeping too. My husband literally documents them in pictures because that's how weird they are. I need to read up more about stimming.
They feel like TRAMPOLINE TO MY EMOTIONS absolutely crazy. That was what clicked for me too!
I took it for years no major issues but when I restarted it I felt hypomanic- sorry I thought you meant you were misdiagnosed with BP2 and it turned out to be autism instead
"Got it, thanks!"
Thank you!!! This is so clarifying to me!
"It's so so so interesting and strange that so many of us have had this experience completely separate from each other lololol sometimes I look back and I resent my childhood self for being so entitled and thinking I was above others, but now looking back I'm realizing it was a reflection of the anger I felt and the coping skills I developed in response to my parents treatment of me during the time and my loneliness. From ages like 8-16 my parents influenced me to compare myself to others and think, ""well maybe I don't have a lot of friends but at least my grades are perfect and I'm going to a good college,"" ""one day I'll be their boss,"" etc. meanwhile I'm 24 still jumping from food service job to food service job after dropping out of community college with severe burnout. I'm still picking up the pieces after my self-realization but it's very comforting to know some aspects I hated about myself were not necessarily personal failures, but a failure to thrive without the accommodations I needed the whole time. I struggled so hard and was denied help for so long that I gave up asking and began hating myself for ""failing"" even though I was ""so mature, intelligent, and independent."" I WASNT INDEPENDENT, I WAS 8, I WAS JUST NEGLECTED lmao"
"Ouch. This one stings over here, currently experiencing growing pains from demasking. 

Send. Prayers."
"Absolutely, what I described as ‘getting tired of’, no longer willing to compromise and people please, having to work on emotional regulation, started with perimenopause with me too."
Me too
"Hello???? Why would they say that 😭😭 like I get it but how are you supposed to react to a comment like that LOL 

Yes! A pet rain cloud that no one else can see. I so agree about the longing. I frequently feel wistful for everything I can never be. 

Yessss that part!!! Did you ever feel like you were lying to people all the time? I felt like such an evil, manipulative person because something deep in me knew I wasn’t being authentic but I’d learned that this was what was expected of me. I felt so fraudulent and it was hard to believe good things about myself."
"Omg now that you mention it, that color DID have a diff texture. Too slick on paper and was way shinier than the rest of the crayons"
"Stimming can be so many things. I like to spin a lot more often now, or sway side to side. I pick my lip but that could be more anxiety than a stim"
"Same thing happened to me! I took it for years, went off it for a while, and when I went back on it, boom. Manic phase. I wasn't misdiagnosed BP2. That diagnosis is accurate, as is the ASD diagnosis."
How do you know you’re demasking? I think I might be going through it but aren’t sure what it looks like
"You’re going to be ok! Sending lots of love. 

You know how draining everything can be? When you only do things you want to do and spend time with people you want to, and you’re yourself the whole time, it’s not. 

It’s scary and uncomfortable at times, but I used to be exhausted all the time to the point that I never wanted to do anything or talk to anyone. I have so much more capacity for everything now."
"Hey, I am in a similar situation here. I haven't ""realized"" yet exactly, but am going through the process I think. Would love to hear your experience if you're kind enough to chat."
"Yes, I did feel like that a lot. Still do!"
I pick my lower lip too! I've been doing it since I was a toddler. And my lip is permanently ruined in the sense that the skin always grows back hard and rough which makes me want to pick it all the more. How about you?
"That’s really strange, I wonder why that happens"
"I am another whose bipolar dx unfortunately checked out and is comorbid. Bipolar 1 for me so it is quite obvious in my case. 

I was dx at 18 after having an attempt during a mixed ep and impulsively escaped before being officially admitted to the psych ward, believing everything was fine because ""I feel great now, actually! 😃"" They placed a bench warrant on me so my parents had to talk me into bringing myself in voluntarily to avoid having the cops do it.

I believe the severity of my mood disorder muddied the waters and therefore helped mask the autism quite a lot until I started piecing it together myself."
Hey. Sorry to be so forward. Please DM me. This sounds exactly like my situation.
Absolutely- message me!
"Honestly same, my lip feels uneven? pick it so it doesnt feel that way anymore. i pick the skin by my thumb as well but only on my right hand. its so calloused now 😂

Lip balms do help but I use mine as like an over night treatment because then I'm not having drinks or eating food that would then be contaminated by said lip balm. has helped it heal much better. i pick more when my lips dry like after ive had a cold and had to mouth breathe for like a week too"
"I didn’t have a manic phase as such, just lots of energy, more like hypomania but didn’t do anything outlandish"
Not sure if you replied to my comment on accident? 🙂
"Callus, that's the word I've been looking for. Thanks for that! Mine does not respond to any lip balm so at this point I've just given up."
Oops sorry! I am still trying to figure this all out.
which lip balm do you use? some are for aesthetic where as some create a barrier to protect the skin?
"All good, wanted to check 🙂"
"Oh I've tried a whole lot of them. Even lanolin which is usually recommended for lactating mothers to soothe irritated bleeding nipples. Not even that worked for me. I could name brands but most of them are Indian brands that I'm guessing you wouldn't be familiar with. Plus, the feel of anything goopy on my lips is a bit hard to handle so I've just decided to let it be for now."
Thanks! Always happy to chat anyways. This community has been so helpful already🙂
I've just used a lip balm thay literally says chap stick on it. put it on just before you go to sleep and ive felt the difference each time even after a new picking.
"Cool, can you tell me the brand name and product name?"
"Feeling tired all my life despite being athletic and in excellent health.

When I started working and these problems surfaced:

*Feeling tortured by sound levels coworkers enjoyed or could tolerate

*Massive meltdowns when there were changes with no warning

*People complaining that I could not say things in a concise manner 

*Interrupting other people

*Freaking out when interrupted in my work by a fast talking supervisor making me learn something new

*Instructions not being specific enough."
38 years old. Days of feeling drained at work led me to learning more about common traits of ASD and I’ll be damned if they didn’t all sound like me
"When I read a description of what an autistic meltdown feels like and also what  shut down is. I always thought my experiences of ""anxiety attacks"" didn't quite fit with the definition."
"When I realised that I can either make eye contact OR have a discussion with someone, not both."
"When my son was diagnosed and I was all like ""But he's just like I was a a kid!"" and literally everyone around me basically went "".... therefore...."""
"Last year, at the age of 48."
"hi, high masking, however low social skills here. I realized I am autistic at 25, honestly, I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 9 so many symptoms I just thought were my ADHD. After following many ADHD Instagram accounts some AUDHD got mixed in there too. I noticed I was relating often to the ADHD and autistic symptoms. It was a long period of doubt and being unsure. But the more I learned about what it means to be autistic from autistic people the more I started to see things making sense of “Oh that's why I do that” or “Oh that explains some childhood experiences” and it just got pilled on more and more until I couldn’t really doubt or deny it anymore. I think I also hit a burnout which made me realize this was more than just anxiety, depression, trauma, and ADHD. When I looked at how I was living my life I realized I was pushing myself too hard to neurotypical standards of productivity and it was destroying me, I could no longer function."
Way too late to do me any good. Diagnosed a couple of weeks ago at 58. \*sigh\*
"In a new job I was reprimanded very early on for two things that I like to think I have masked up and over: asking too many questions (omg, how embarrassing to get in trouble for this) and also for being misinterpreted as defiant when really I had no idea what was (not actually explicitly) being asked of me.  I really thought, sure, I'm an abrasive person who runs a very tight ship, I don't small talk, I have my strengths and weaknesses, but I know what they want and I'm willing to fake it, surely I wouldn't get in trouble at a new job for a noob mistake like asking too many questions and not understanding a request and so coming off as rebellious.  Fuck.  It really just made me think that I'm getting nowhere actually.  I *think* I'm putting on better masks that slip less often, but year after year, same issues, same failures, indeed, as I've gotten older, old problems I associate with youth coming back to haunt me again. Feeling as if I can no longer believe that I am delayed and catching up, but realizing at middle age that if I'm not caught up by now I'm always going to be behind normative expectations.  And feeling so so sad that I have *tried* to live up to them so hard. Humiliated by how hard I have tried and humiliated by how hard I have failed.

So then I got diagnosed autistic finally."
"I was diagnosed earlier this year, at 40. Didn’t think I would meet the social criteria for diagnosis. Was going for assessment because I was experiencing sensory sensitivities and extreme burnout at work that looked like reduced executive function. Turns out I’m less good at masking than I thought I was - the assessor noticed things about me that weren’t even on my radar, including a flat affect and difficulty with eye contact, and my social anxiety was deemed secondary to autism.

I wouldn’t have picked up on it on my own - it had to be pointed out to me."
"When my psychiatrist suggested it, at the beginning of this month. I'm 35."
Realizing that years of learning how not to make enemies is not something most people ever experience
"32. In my mid-20s I started to think maybe I had a learning disability, like dyslexia or something, due to how much I struggled in school (it was PDA autism) despite testing in the 99th percentile on every standardized test I took. Around the time I turned 30 I'd started to think it was ADD instead. Finally got a psychiatrist a couple years later, and then the slippery slope of diagnoses began, lol.

After a couple years of being diagnosed, I also realized I'm not actually as good at masking as I'd previously thought, I'm just intelligent and anxious enough (more the latter, I think) to cover up my social faux pas more thoroughly than most. If I'd been slightly less prone to avoiding conflict and less adept at communication, I probably would have gotten diagnosed as having Asperger's when that was still a thing."
"During the diagnostic testing, I came across one of those ""agree-disagree"" questions that was phrased something like, ""I think about people in fundamentally the same way I think about objects.""   

I kind of did a double take, because it felt like there wasn't a ""right"" answer to that that I'd learned and internalized over the years, so I clarified with the clinician, ""should I be giving the answer that feels intuitive? Or the ... right answer."" And I realized immediately that I needed to go back through most of the other questions because I hadn't actually answered them intuitively."
"Two years ago after I (36) had my biggest burnout ever and all my masks shattered after my life dissolved and I became homeless. I fell into a period of really terrible mental health where all my repressed traumas became overwhelming. It's taking years to get up and running again as I still have difficulty leaving the house or speaking to people in person or on the phone, but during all of that time researching and talking to professionals is when I learned I am ASD/ADHD. I just happened to have social interaction and comedy skills as some of my special interests, which helped me to subconsciously build a really good mask. So much so I was wearing it for myself. (Constant internal gaslighting. Telling myself I was wrong for misunderstanding things or having struggles. Dismissing my own pain and trauma. Tons of self-doubt about even accepting the diagnosis with professionals stating it.) It's been a long ride.. Haha"
"A Dr suggested my son could be autistic, so I started researching autism while waiting for him to get assessed. The more books and articles I read, the more tests I took, and the more personal experience I listened to the more apparent it was that I show excessively strong signs of autism. I have severe sensory issues for one thing, but also have most of the classical characteristics like strong at math and puzzle solving and stuff. Plus my social skills really came from rigorous study and involves a TON of conscious thought, so the one non-autistic thing about me is my least natural trait. Still, it wasn’t until I talked to my mom about it that I really accepted it. 

As it turned out, my oldest brother had just been diagnosed with autism but had not told me yet. He and I have very similar ways of thinking. She also said that as babies he and I both were obsessed with lining things up. Especially raisins, and toy cats. She also said that he and I used to flap our hands any time we got excited, and pointed out how overly sensitive all my senses were and how often I’d melt down. And we’re the only two of her 7 kids to do those behaviors. That’s when I really knew knew, and fully accepted this new reality. Still waiting for my son and I to get assessed, but I feel like it’s more of a formality at this point."
"I was probably 40 or something, before that I had suspected ADD for a while, but I had not really considered autism apart from recognizing a few traits earlier with a friend who though he may have 'aspergers' because his sister had it. (10-15 years ago)"
"Around a year ago at 35. After getting adhd diagnosis, starting treating and adapting my life, I started noticing there was a lot of issues/traits becoming apparent that weren't explained by adhd and further research led directly to autism. I think part of me always knew and so did my family as they were excessively focused on shaping my behavior to be more social and fit in."
"This year while watching 'The Good Doctor"".
It was a bunch of ""Wait a second, that's me right there"" and ""So that's autism???""

I was completely unaware of what Autism actually was and the more I understood it, the more I saw my whole life making sense."
That I need to constantly meet others peoples to increase my social skills
"I was diagnosed with ADHD at 9 and those traits presented more and masked some of my autistic traits. But when I learned how co-morbid they can be, I really started to look into being autistic. It was towards the end of 2020, when I was 28 when I started having these inklings. I started taking it a bit more seriously in 2021, but it wasn't until the end of 2022 that I started saying I was self diagnosed. I got a documented diagnosis in May of this year, just over a month before I turned 31."
"46 years old. Things just started adding up. Overlapping diagnoses that didn’t quite fit right after pursuing them with my psychologist (generalized anxiety, ADHD, depression, agoraphobia, dissociation). 

But mostly, it was all these odd little things about me that as I got older I realized weren’t really common or “normal” attributes:


- Like how I hyperfixate on things like velvet clothing, iridescent clear pencil cases, puzzles (specifically puzzles of cityscapes), tabby cats, sets of 6 six-sides dice (my collection is huge), collecting / hoarding random things just because they are a specific shade of dark teal, extreme sensory issues but also I have synesthesia, *how I can’t sleep unless I am perfectly tucked in with the sheets not creased and the top sheet perfectly folded one foot over the edge of the duvet, and if the sheets get untucked at the bottom by my feet I feel like I’m dying a tortuous death,* the increasing feeling of not being capable of growing up, not being great at reading textbooks, not understanding how people can just read things and then learn them, looking back on my job choices (always needing jobs that required the exact same tasks at the exact same time every single day, (so working for airlines, public transportation, taxi dispatch centers), bringing my journal to house parties so “I’d have something to do,” buying three sets of the exact same outfit so I can wear it for several days in a row without being dirty, how odd it is that I excel in jobs that require me to talk and be professionally social but genuinely have little to no desire for friendships, the way I ramble on too long about the same specific topic and how it feels like an itch that I can’t scratch enough, how I’ve always had to mindfully *not hum* while I chewed food, the dozens and dozens of times someone has told me “oh I couldn’t tell if you were having a good time” when I was sincerely having the best time of my life…….."
[deleted]
When I learned about masking and how it typically shows up in women and girls. I realized it made all my life experiences make sense.
"I found out in my thirties. I suspected something was off for years, but it wasn’t until a family member was diagnosed that I looked into it and realized I checked almost every box. I later found out the truth that my family knew I was, even had me tested, but decided it was best not to tell anyone, including me."
"29! Just now realizing im not actually good with it, im good with masking enough for people to think im good at this, but internally makes me really really anxious, RSD, and depressed so there is that"
"I don’t know if I’m actually autistic, but reading this subreddit and going over the signs has put a lot about my upbringing and personal struggles into perspective. It would make a lot of sense. I just turned 25."
"I was told I was ”very autistic, but aldo very talented at creating coping skills, so I dont get the disgnosis vause there’s not enough disability” I was 39. Since then my world hs changed. I got a diagnosis this year, age 45"
"I didn’t ever have a lot of friends but I had a few. Most people did NOT like me. But I did fine with mentors etc. I did okay with people much older or much younger. 

When I really noticed the change was my late 30s into my 40s. Once all the managers and bosses were my age, I couldn’t work. Everyone was mad all the time. I didn’t have older mentors to have more structured interactions with. I got a dx at 43."
"I finally went to a psychiatrist after years of self diagnosing myself as ""just"" having social anxiety."
"I just found out in the last year, basically because I hit burnout, and I lost all the skills.  I can still ""fit in"" sometimes, but it's exhausting--like I need a couple of days in bed to recover.  I can't mask like I used to--I didn't even know I was masking before.  

The downside is a lot of people who have known me for a long time are convinced that I'm not autistic and that I'm just ""putting on and act"" now.  They can't seem to get that I was putting on an act before."
"As others mentioned: either eye contact or make conversation not both haha. 

Mainly the fact that past a superficial level (example at work or in the break room at work) I couldn’t make, maintain friendships or social connections. I had rigid thinking, and unless topics were about my interest I had no interest in the conversation. 

Little things like sensory issues, liking routine, social skill issues (I thought were just anxiety), special interests. They also helped me “figure it out”, there’s so much more. 

I think the main one was social issues paired with sensory issues. They then led me into researching and learning about ASD more, this led to me seeking a formalised diagnosis."
"I was never really confident in social situations. I just faked it at work as best I could. And drank lots of alcohol when I went out with people. 

Now I’m 43yo and feel even more awkward now that I don’t drink anymore. I just stay home and try to avoid people. 

It was only a little over a month ago that I started reading about autism. My entire life makes sense now."
35 years old when I saw myself in a video recording.
"I deeply knew inside all along, because of my defergient interests, way of thinking and the way that even with my ""great"" social skills there was always a bit of distence between me and ""normal"" poeple. 

&#x200B;

In my case specifically I also have ADD and a high EQ, so I know very quickly how others are feeling and what they want or don't want to hear. But that part for me is knowledge based, not ""feeling"" based. Its something I learned (and takes effort). 

&#x200B;

I know how someone is feeling and chose to feel empathy for them, and I do care, but I decided to care based on the knowledge how they feel. So for me there is this extra step involved. Empathy doesn't just turn on, it is a learned experience (with which AD(H)D ""helped"" me a bit in this regard).

&#x200B;

I have had doubts over the years because of my social skills, but most recently I experienced thought related panic attacks (OCD basically) and I am getting help for this. But I now see how ADD and Autism have always been a part of my life. 

&#x200B;

I was diagnosed with this (after about 10 different diagnoses) when I was about 15 years old and at that point didn't care and expected them to be wrong again. Imagine my suprise when I now realize that the person who made the final diagnoses on me was actually right."
"Until My late 20s When I used to get Annoyed by Neighbors Just Closing their doors because my apartment is so quiet

And as a kid getting anxious when I hear my parents start the car up that loud engine sound in the morning

And that used to bother me

Feeling tired all the time

And I didn't know why 

Didn't know it was Autistic symptoms until 2021

Until some people online told me autism is a spectrum

Because I had a Uneducated Thing about autism

I didn't know it was a spectrum.

I always thought people in my community denying I had autism because

They thought of autism as the more severe types they show in movies

Since movies always exaggerate and put things to the extreme for Entertainment and Movie sales.

Like Tv always show the More Severe types on commercials and news segments

So I thought I didn't have autism

Until being online and people telling me that autism is a spectrum.

And it can be mild.

And I thought of all the symptoms I had.

Of Lining My Toys up Like It was A Line.

And having a affection for Neon Colors as a Kid.

Like Miami and Toronto Niagara Falls Neon lights I love the pictures 

Even to this day as A 30 year old Adult. I really like Neon Colors and lights.

Christmas lights as well

Like I still have my Christmas lights on until June.

Being Obsessed With The 80s Fashion and The 90s Fashion

Other instances of 

Hearing Loud Laughing and I Would get anxious.

Couldn't hold a conversation

Been diagnosed with several mental health conditions

Such as Agoraphobia and Severe Social Anxiety and panic disorder Generalized Anxiety disorder and Bipolar and PTSD 

And my Issues not getting better.

And seeing some people with my condition getting better.

And people holding a conversation which i couldn't do

People in school always picking up on me

Bullying me every school I went

Don't matter how I Dressed

Sometimes I occasionally had money to wear trendy clothes

And I still was getting bullied

No matter what school I went to.

Being alone living alone and being scared to live with others

Can't hold a conversation to save my life

People calling me quirky and weird online dating apps and social media.

And some people blocked me because I said something I didn't know certain things people should say.

And I remember my sister correcting me as a kid.

Because I didn't Know I was Supposed to say thank you.

When someone complimented me on something.

Just a lot

Being Angry sometimes

That I have random changes in my routine out of my control 

Or like I just switched therapists and I would get upset

And took a long time still not adjusting to abrupt changes."
When my friends explained to me what autism was and that I show a lot of signs
"Earlier this year, age of 27. I had always kind of wondered and when I brought that up to my therapist they helped me learn about it and eventually realized I for sure was and probably my dad is too! Who knew? Certainly put a fuckload of stuff from my childhood into perspective and made a lot of stuff clock into place."
"I suffered a brain injury that drastically reduced my physical (and mental) endurance/ energy levels. Suddenly everything was hard.


  I hadn’t even known I was masking until I suddenly and urgently needed that energy back for regular life stuff. I was literally having sudden unplanned naps during the day from exhaustion.


That was a decade ago and I’ve done a lot of adapting but it’s much more evident that I’m autistic now. Too expensive to hide it."
"Divorce after 13 years together, age 40."
"During the midst of serious venlafaxine withdrawal, when all my reactions were x10, and psychiatrists were saying that I don't satisfy criteria for personality disorders, but that I might as well get checked out for ASD"
Honestly I read Nicole Cliffe on Twitter and things she said about her daughter and how it made she and her husband suspect they were autistic and then I took a look at my life and realized wait a minute…
"I'm 32 and cant hold a job, it seems the more I try the more trauma i accumulate."
When I started learning how to help my kids.
"After my daughter (who is 7) and my son (who is 4) both got diagnosed in the same year. In reading about and learning more about it, I realized the call maybe comes from inside the house. 
I got a new psychiatrist recently and we discussed that and she said, hearing what she has heard from me, she agrees it's definitely a strong possibility. 
I hate eye contact (can do it ok when people are talking to me, but can't at all when I am talking)
I need a long break after work (which rarely can happen bc hi, kids) to regroup and decompress (and my job is not that stressful, and I work from home, and I only work a 4 day week)
I get overstimulated extremely by too much conflicting noise. Ironically one of my kids has a stim that affects this.
I hate small talk. Like would rather be late to something important than risk having to make chit chat.
I hate changes in routine or schedule, no matter how small. My response is in proportion to how big the change is though, at least..."
Since the pandemic. People started openly posting on FB about ND characteristics. I always identified with the specifically autistic quirks. One of my coworkers gave me a recommendation for an assessor.
"Last year. I suspected some time earlier, but only last year did I realise"
"31 but I always, always knew something was up with me and felt like I was… fake assimilating or something."
Always has issues in social situations until I took a public speaking class.  It taught me how to talk to people.  10 years later i realized that needing a class to learn how to talk to people was a sign.  I'm 39
After 35 for sure.
"While taking Child Psychology at age 17. We were learning about how undiagnosed autistism sometimes seems like behavioral issues. My friend said it sounded like we were learning about me. I felt like I was learning about my mom. 

At this same time, my mom was taking a similar class in Grad School. She said it sounded like me and decided to call me autistic anytime she was upset with me. She would bring up issues I had as a kid and say “see, you are autistic.” That infuriated me because I got beatings a lot and put out of class a lot for misunderstandings. I needed support, not physical punishments.

I spoke to my therapist about possibly being autistic, but I couldn’t stop crying. She said “Would it be the end of the world if you actually were on the spectrum?” I said yes and she changed the subject. I wish I had said no."
"When covid hit and I was the only one enjoying myself in lockdown. When we were out of lockdown I couldn’t go back to how I was before, it was like my mask had been off for too long and I couldn’t put it back"
"After multiple people asked me if I was Autistic, I decided to hyperfixate on Autism and learn everything I could about it and realized it fits the bill."
"Sorry I missed the rest of your question.

I'm AuDHD. The ADHD helps compensate for a lot of my autistic 'deficits,' like with talking and social stuff and doing new things and breaking routine, etc. But there were/are still a lot of things about me that I thought meant I *couldn't* be autistic. Nope. Just didn't understand what it really meant. 

For example- I thought I had no trouble with eye contact. Turns out I look at people when they're talking and look EVERYWHERE ELSE when I'm talking. Sustained eye contact feels so intense. No problem with people closest to me.

I thought I didn't script. But then I realized that's what I was doing going over conversations in my head, after the fact, ad nauseum. I have a constant narration going in my mind. It's mostly conversations I've had with others or how i'd explain certain things."
"In my case I guess the best way to describe my social skills development is ""delayed"". I have good masking skills/ok social skills now because I am 45 and have been getting slowly better at it. I could maybe survive high school now (lol). I would still rather jump off a cliff than go to a party or some other social event where I don't know anyone and would have to ""mingle"". But I can get along fine with the spouses friends or be friendly somewhat normal-ish to people I encounter on the street. I am way better than I was at say 16 years old."
30+
"When I went out to the bar for the first time in four years, after leaving a  nearly five year relationship abruptly. It was only then did I realize that I couldn't stand being anywhere near that much noise and people. I had been forcing myself before to do it."
"i realized at 21 and was diagnosed at 24, but i was in CBT for “social anxiety” for a couple years as a teen. it never helped, it felt like gaslighting and a waste of time. i even masked my way through therapy. i never saw myself as “different” or practiced expressions in the mirror, i just knew that socializing was an exhausting effort for me. i noticed that the only way i was able to shop or hang out with someone was after a shift at my retail job, because i’d keep the customer service attitude for the whole day. 

i was also bullied a lot. i was asked if i had autism/bipolar/tourettes… so i think the kids around me could tell something was really off"
29 years old
"I always knew something was “wrong” with me in that I felt so different from everyone. I started reading abnormal psychology books at like 10 to try to figure out what was up with me despite my ability to mask well generally. 

But at 18 I 1) got out of my first relationship which was pretty emotionally abusive and 2) moved out of state to attend my dream college, a transition I’d wildly underestimated. My ability to connect to the people around me rapidly deteriorated. At 19/20 I binge watched the show Parenthood and the autistic character Max was the only one that made any sense to me. That made me think…hm? So I semi-jokingly told my friends I thought I might be autistic, and we all chuckled. But year after year it kept popping up in my brain, and each time I’d read more and more about it, circling the conclusion I’d eventually come to. Diagnosed officially at 26, primarily to get other people to stop dismissing my self-diagnosis."
Around 4yo but the thing hadn't got a name until I was 38 and I got diagnosed.
"When they stopped working and I burned out in a blaze of glory lmao

At 19."
"I self-diagnosed (now officially) after getting treated for ADHD then realizing it didn’t cover all the bases. But getting treated for it and improving those symptoms helped a lot to get to know myself and investigate more into ASD. It took the slowing down of my mind and deep reflection to give me no doubt about being on the spectrum after multiple therapists brushed that idea off because of my super social lifestyle and public-facing persona.

Now, I’m embracing who I am more and being more honest about what/where/who/how I want to navigate this world; been trimming away a lot of my old, noisy life and opting for a slower, quieter world I don’t need a mask for most of the time. It’s been difficult but the burnout and shutdowns have not been a part of my life since, whereas I’d fall through the cracks socially and professionally multiple times a year. I am still grieving the high-masking social persona often; getting off social media has helped that

This all happened in the last few years (35M)"
"37 years old, and I actually started realizing it because I read about masking and camouflaging."
"22m I realized that everything I said in those social situations was scripted, and to myself I thought the world was a play of people saying these sorts of things, then I realized NT people have a sort of predetermined dialog and that I was the only one writing some sort of ""play"""
"About 1.5-2 years ago when i encountered social media posts om autism and went ”Huh, i relate to quite a lot of these, i need to read more” and then it just explained me more and more the more i got to know about it and finally felt understood and validated.

Edit: I’m 24 now."
"My partner was dx about 2 years ago which kickstarted my learning. Mental health has always been a special interest of mine (I’m a therapist and graduated with my MSW in may). Quickly became an expert. Noticed the signs in my daughters (not biologically related to my partner). Related to some of the symptoms as a child but not now so I figured if I was I’d never be dx- I’m too good socially! (So I thought). I’ve always been very introspective but I started paying even closer attention. I’m good at eye contact! -well except for when I’m thinking. I’m good at back and forth conversations! -well except for when I forget to ask follow up questions. I started noticing more and more things. Then one day I recognized that I was scripting a conversation I would have with my coworkers. Things started to click. The final nail in the coffin was when I hit autistic burnout and my social skills regressed. In my family I have the lowest support needs thanks to years of dissociation but as I started to heal, I burned out harder than ever."
"Around 34? I suspected since I was 30, but I got super high with a friend, couldn't mask like usual when it finally clicked, and I accepted it. Dx'd ADHD somewhere around 25/26"
"I suspected autism for 15 years, and was self diagnosed for that long. But everyone around me questioned it, and so I had a hard time fully believing it myself. Afterall I seemed to be getting on okay.

I started having more issues with symptoms and new sensitivity issues in my late 20s. Around when I had to become a full time college student bc I was in a cohort program. The stress of trying to keep up with that when I have severe trauma related memory issues (and literally have to study like 13 hours for a college level quiz) made everything else much more obvious. 

I started burning out. I graduated college in 2020, only managed 1 year of full time work before I had to go part time. Been in my current part time job 2 years now but the burnout is getting worse and I dont know what to do. I have performance issues at work now, and I have people who have been extremely rude (I think its harrassment bording on discrimination but HR disagrees). I love my line of work I just have trouble with the people Im working with. Now Im facing the reality of possibly needing a new job or career soon if the negative treatment Im experiencing at work doesnt stop. If you like learning about cognitive biases like I do, Im pretty sure my coworkers have a ""horns"" bias against me.

The work troubles led me to getting diagnosed this year. The assesor told me she was comfortable diagnosing me with autism within an HOUR of the 5 hour long assesment bc apparently my autism is that obvious (or Im so burnt out I cant mask anymore). We did the full assesment anyways for work reasons.

TLDR: Life getting more complex while gaining more sensory issues as I aged caused autistic burnout I could no longer ignore. Got diagnosed recently and am trying to figure out how to live as an autistic person who cant mask anymore. Any advice from people who have been through this would be appreciated..."
"Last Friday after working with my therapist weekly for two years on depression, ptsd (military), alcoholism, and then ADHD.  I feel like a peeled onion, which I guess is a good thing.  Looking into a formal assessment, but the more I research, the more it speaks to my life experiences."
"I always knew i had IMMENSE difficulty making new friends at the end of every school year. I just couldn't figure out how to do it for the life of me. Thought i was just socially awkward... When my life started going awry when i was 18 because i couldn't keep going in my studies without work anymore i realised there was something amiss. Burnout, psychiatrists, assessments later, i realised i was definitely autistic"
"My therapist told me. It was a lot of reflecting back and realizing A) that I was autistic and B) just how autistic I really was. To add to this: I've walked on my toes my whole life, without knowing why."
"I kept getting irritated at my classmates when they kept talking when they weren't supposed to. Few other sensory issues also. There was another autistic kid in my class and he also told them to shut up and I knew how he was feeling when he said it because it was very relatable. Finally after a lot of googling, I found an article about autism meltdowns and was like ""oh shit"""
"My daughter was diagnosed in March 2020. Spent a fair amount of lockdown time reading about autism in kids, then moved on to autism in adults. I had so many “ohhh that’s why I’m like I am in this circumstance” or “oh man this person sounds like they are living my life” moments."
"I never felt socially “normal” and I always felt their was something missing in me when it came to building/maintaining relationships with other people. I always felt robotic when engaging in small talk and found myself exhausted, annoyed, and confused in day to day social situations. I also noticed I always seemed to rub people the wrong way and/or upset people without intending to. 

Being autistic wasn’t on my radar until my about 5 years ago (about age 24) when I was doing internet research on sensory sensitivity to sound and light. Then that progressed to me specifically researching the “symptoms” of autism in women and girls and then I knew. I talked about it with my therapist, went through the diagnosis process and then I knew for sure. 

I’m still the same socially. But now I know why and am better able to manage when/how often I wear the mask."
"After trying to enter a real adult relationship. Being so intimate and vulnerable feels strange to me. Just basic things like having healthy communication tactics in an argument scenario were totally lost on me. Some of it is just family trauma, but I really don't know how to be really close to someone and explain myself properly when I get anxious."
when it freakin caused me so much energy that I had to shelter in for an entire week.
Like 36
"I realised once a new friend of mine kept rebutting all my struggles with ""you know, with me, that's because of my autism"". 

Up until that point I thought I must have had really, really bad adhd to not fit any of the adhd descriptions and not having adhd treatments work as promised."
"Around 19 I realized what the definition of autism is and that I matched it. I always knew I was autistic though even if I didn’t know what autism was. I may mask well, but I’m still so different and most people can tell one way or the other. Usually I just play off by warning people that I’m a dork/dumb and they’re just a lot nicer than if I tell them I’m disabled"
"I worked in customer service for years before I was diagnosed and it absolutely drained me. 

One time I was chatting with coworkers about a busy day and I mentioned how exhausting it was having to be “on” all the time. When they were confused and asked what I meant, I explained (what I now know to be masking) how when you have to switch from “normal” to “customer” to “friend/coworker” mode when talking to people and putting energy into interactions. Needing to focus on listening to people and watch their body language to assess and figure out how to interact with them. 

They looked at me like I grew another head. They were saying things like “why are you overthinking it so much? You just have to be nice and be yourself”. 

So, in that moment I immediately panicked, because I know if I’m myself people assume something is wrong. Because I’m naturally quite monotone with “resting bitch face” and people don’t like that. I need to adapt to the people around me to get by and here I am standing in front of a bunch of people looking at me, and this new head I’ve grown, telling me that I’m “putting too much thought into it” and that I’m “making it harder than it needs to be”. 
But already is hard for me, I’m not doing it on purpose. I do these things because otherwise people think I’m being rude or I’m not interested and NT don’t like that. I do these things because if I don’t make sure I’m picking up every possible social cue and put it together in milliseconds to form a response, I won’t know what to say or how to say it and NT don’t like it. 

So I said “yeh, you’re probably right”, and didn’t talk about it with them again. 
I got my diagnoses a year or two later and all the pieces started falling into place."
"When I went from one job interview (started with internships) to the next and 1/ I realized I could take notes or actively participate, not both 2/ the feedback usually was that I ""looked absent"", which I could not understand since I was so hyper-focused on the interviewer's speech
(Apologies if any mistake, English is not my mother tongue)"
"Oooh, this hits me in the guts."
"This is a critical hit. I wasn't even consciously aware I experince these until now that you named it. Wow. I was ALWAYS so tired after school I didn't comprehend how my peers were able to go after extracurricular activities. And I still am when I go to or come back from uni. Also I was often crying as a child at sudden loud sounds.Being too much or too quiet in conversations (I wasn't directly told, it's rather the nonverbal communication that triggered RSD).

Ahh, so many thoughts on this I can't cover here!! But thank you for your comment! :)"

*People complaining that I could not say things in a concise manner 

I still don't understand why NT hate this so much. If I had a dollar for every time I heard, ""You can't just *say* that""..."
"I’ve had the same thing, same age. I just burnt out but kept going for about 2 years. Then I saw 3 posts about being ND and burnout and it all came together. 

Very common for those of us naturally good at masking, to reach an age where the body refuses to continue with that level of continual background stress. Not sustainable with the energy levels of someone approaching 40.

And another thing. Having a child at that age (I have a beautiful 2 year old), means that background stress is higher than it’s ever been before anyway. And that’s on top. All that I’m sure triggered my eventual understanding that I was AuDHD."
I only realised the difference when I had an actual panic attack and it was surreal.
Would you feel comfortable elaborating on the differences? I want to learn more about them to recognize for myself as well. It's completely fine if you don't.
"That's a good point too! I thought this was normal to look away for ""concentrating"" in a conversation. Well."
I cannot upvote this enough! Thank you for sharing this as it is extremely validating knowing I'm not the only struggling with this irritating dichotomy.
"Same for me but it was 2 years ago, when I was 48."
"I'm happy for you that you got an answer finally. And looking at the other comments it's so saddening that, no matter the age, many people suffer so much before the diagnosis and didn't understand themself and why the treatment for anxiety and depression won't work. 

Thank you for sharing, have a nice day <3"
"Please do not despair.

I got diagnosed just recently and am a lot older than you. Ive never been the Pollyanna type. Am the crabby type.  I tend to see the glass as half full -- and to my surprise am discovering this late diagnosis is a relief.

Am feeling like a weight has rolled off my back.

Am relieved and glad  I am wired in such a way that I cannot adjust to certain things (e.g. obnoxiously loud music in the workplace) and can henceforth ignore twits dweebs and assholes who say that I can and must adjust.

Have already used new diagnosis to get a physician's note and demanded accommodation at work.  Will be exploring whether there are training programs available for late diagnosed persons like us.

Some months before the diagnosis, I got into a screaming altercation with a brutish coworker who employed hideously loud music and I got written up.  Will be arranging to have a copy of physician's not attached to my write up as contextual information to be taken into account."
I feel this! I ask sooo many questions and people really do NOT like it.
The insanity that an employer reprimanded you for asking too many questions! If they wrote you up I would have loved to see it. What are people supposed to do when they’re not understanding something??
"I thought courteously offering my disagreements was a citizen's right, not insubordination. 

And I grew up in an opinionated Irish Catholic/Jewish family.  Didnt know my dad had asd."
"Oh wow, this hits home. I had a complete burnout at 20 and dropped out of university. Thankfully I wasn't homeless because I was able to move back in with my parents. I'm sorry that happened to you. All my masks collapsed and I could barely leave the house, and I was on a hairpin trigger for anything that was sensory disagreeable. Lost friends, strained relationship with family as they didn't understand what was going on. Went to therapy for years, for social anxiety and depression, but all that really did is help me build up my mask again. I wanted to be 'normal', so I hid how I really felt from my therapist and really believed the ""fake it till you make it"" mantra we had going on.

Deep down, the anxiety and depression never went away - now I realise it's because I'm autistic and can start to be kinder to myself. But for years I tried telling myself that I wasn't anxious, I wasn't depressed, I don't find everything difficult, I'm just like everyone else... gaslighting myself, just like you say. Tonnes of self loathing, etc.

As other people have said, I'm now older (nearing 40), and I've had baby. Between having less energy to keep up the mask as I've gotten older, covid putting a big stop to my social 'practice', and my baby causing sensory meltdowns & shutdowns, it all led me to start questioning if maybe there's something else going on."
What caused your life to dissolve?
Did you feel dead inside? Or did your ex wife just perceive you that way?
Why don't people your own age like you? Because those interactions aren't as structured?
Ditto here. Honestly makes me want to find new friends as I still feel the need to mask around old friends/acquaintances
"Oh interesting, what did you observe?"
How do you stay afloat?
"I only have a 4 year old, but I get you. You get much less alone time to recharge. I've been super struggling with playgrounds that have other people at them."
"I'm so sorry that you experienced that. Being autistic is not bad at all, or at least it's yours to decide whether it is or not. It never came up again in your conversations?"
"Wow, same! When I want to relate to certain aspects I think of my friends and family and when my masking is not that prominent there (thankfully). But looking at all interactions out of secure and known territories I feel uncomfortable with sustaining eye contact, I can''t concentrate and Always look away when I'm talking, just like you said now.

Also the scripting: I don't script in front of my family and friends but I do when I want to start conversation with other people, especially people my age (it's such a vulnerable situation!). But even more prominently I'd often had ""interviews"" in my head explaining certain circumstances or talking about something else a lot. I didn't know why I'd do this since it wasn't a conscious decision to do so, it just happened regularly.

Wow, I'm so blown off by all these responses!"
Also I went selectively mute at a thanksgiving party 🎉

"Thank you!  
  
The ASD subreddits are rocking my world, too :)  
  
Someone on another of these subreddits wrote how they'd felt tired their whole lives and I went - me too.  
  
Just now did a Google search. Look what came up:  
  
https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=reddit+asd+%22tired+all+my+life%22  
  
I'd read about people going to school and working, and running some sort of side hustle. I have a coworker in her sixties who also works a second job. I can't imagine doing that.  
  
Validating information is a beautiful thing. A beautiful thing."
This is me at 38 also.
"I remember my first panic attack, too. Years after I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder lol"
"The main difference I noticed is that anxiety/panic attacks are often described as having one trigger that has to do with feeling worried or afraid. I'm sure there are exceptions to this, however. In contrast, meltdowns are more often triggered after an accumulation of things and are characterized by feelings of overwhelm. Again, of course, there are exceptions to this. But when I would have ""anxiety attacks,"" I would usually not be worried about one subject in particular, but rather, I would feel it build until I was so overwhelmed I lost control. Furthermore, I had heard of the freeze response to anxiety, but when I read the description of a shut down, it was just a much more detailed description of what would happen to me: being unable to speak or move yet inside feeling completely and utterly overwhelmed. This is all obviously an oversimplified version, and like I said, there are exceptions in both categories, but one just describes my experience way better than the other."
"Haha yep, same, I really thought everyone was concentrating on their body and how they say things instead of what is being said, apparently not.. haha"
"Aaah, that's so sweet! And the more you think about it, the less you are listening to the conversation, it's a never ending cycle, am I right? 😅"
"Good for you!

I'm not really despairing... but it's a lot to process. Looking at all the ways autism messed up my life and I didn't even know it. So much I blame myself for that wasn't my fault, you know? Like not being able to get a job after earning my doctorate. It wasn't the job market that sucked... it was me."
Isn't it just a way to show interest? I don't understand why people would be mad at this when we try to build a shared understanding and/ or want to do our work well. :(
"I was legitimately written up in an employee review for ""not messing around with and talking with my coworkers"", instead, I did my work. Same job and review, I was also written up for ""being too slow due to being too meticulous, even though maintaining the lowest error rate"". I felt completely defeated. This was years ago and before my ASD diagnosis."
"Absolutely! There are often too many times people just suppose they understand something and in the end they actually don't! And concerning work it's even more important, how could that be a reason to reprimand someone?"
"Some workplaces are covertly authoritarian -- organizational pathology that too often goes unnoticed. 

ASD people who are very highly educated but who are obligated to work entry level jobs run into trouble with less educated bosses who have authoritarian mindsets. They sense we are both superior to them and inferior to them -- and because they are our bosses we are the ones who get reprimanded and written up. 

F\*\*k  :("
"The situation was that I was away from my desk, being trained by someone else, and from that seat I was asked by my roaming supervisor ""is *your* computer working yet today?"" And I gave a detailed rundown of everything I knew about that computer today.  What I didn't realize is it was being implied ""would you please stop what you are doing here, go check it again while I wait, and then come right back and tell me how it went.""  Somehow all the people around me knew that's what was being asked of me via implicature.  And I was later questioned as to why I was being so stubborn and disrespectful. My coworker told me ""you have to learn to talk to her better, she is your boss.""  And I BURNED UP trying to figure out WTF had just happened.  My explanations of the status of the computer issue were interpreted as haughty, defiant, and know-it-all.  But I was truly confused and had zero idea a request was being made of me implicitly."
"I was working a corporate art job that was near constant harassment and anxiety for about 2 years until my health started failing. (High BP, weight loss, cluster headaches, blackouts, etc.) My doctors tested me for like 5 months because they were really worried I was having some type of seizure or stroke from stress, but all the tests pointed down completely different avenues than they anticipated so they dead-ended eventually.

My job ended up firing over half the art department for some conditional BS they had apparently been sitting on for over half a year, and they did it literally 3 weeks before COVID became a national issue with protections and the like.

Bad place bad time meant I just broke. I had no support and couldn't get any services to help me because I couldn't advocate for myself, but I was still somehow considered a fully functioning adult.

My family and friends started jumping ship after about a year. About 2 days before I lost my house, my mother realized she had never asked me if she could bring me some groceries. The day I lost my house my two oldest best friends reached out and asked me to go to lunch with them. When I told them I was literally mid-crisis they said I'm ""always mid-crisis"" and that was their last attempt to reach out and help me. (They apparently just wanted to tell me off to my face, because one of them reconnected with me just recently now that I am beginning to function again and told me how much my not talking to him on FB hurts him even though he actively ignores me when I do and I was homeless for half a year and literally almost died, so I don't know how that seems fair to dump on me)

Now it's a little over two years later and I have nothing to my name and live with a friend in government housing in a town I have never been before. I am doing better, but still not good enough.

I don't want anyone else to have to go through anything like what my friend and I have had to go through. I had *SO* little, but it was all the foundation and stability I could create for myself; and the world just ripped it out from under me. Literally deal with psychotic episodes and more C-PTSD than I ever fucking thought possible now. (And the physical issues haven't gone away, because they're genetic, too!)"
"Not OP (Diagnosed at 29, now 30) but for me older people often overlooked me being immature as they already assumed I would be immature since I am younger than they are. 

Younger people either did not care I was immature or it allowed me to “play on the same level” as them. 

People my age could sense the discrepancy in maturity. This still happens to me regularly. My peers look at me as someone much younger despite being the same age."
It's like I can't help masking!  It's so ingrained in me that I just automatically do it.  And then I'm completely wiped out later.  I don't know how to stop.
"Stimming, verbal ticks like repetitive language, involuntary movements, avoiding direct eye-contact (looking in the lens), etc.

To me it is unnerving because I dislike being on camera or having my photograph taken in general. Seeing my Autism on full display makes me want to crawl in a hole and wonder how I have been treated by others just because..."
"Constant Suicidal Ideation, and cowards fear of pain even tho physical pain masks the emotional pain. I'm not in a good place and dont see a way out. most people recommend something different with out any concrete example or a person to call."
"I had to laugh out loud when I saw this link, haha. Oh my goodness.The sad part is that it's hindering from bonding further with other people after uni/worl and so I keep on being on surface level with colleages I even like. But after uni I feel so drained. I also struggle with driving to uni to meet someone there. Ahhh"
"I see now, this is very insightful. Thank you!"
Absolutely! Thinking about it more means one is no longer actively listening.
That’s what I’ve always thought.
That seems unethical
Omg you summed up my experience so well! Very depressing.
Sorry to hear that! I meant like how do you pay your bills?
i keep those to a minimun
"Unfortunately mine is being a very nice person to the point of being a doormat, who wouldn’t want to inconvenience anyone else."
"I don't have a single mask. Masking is often about trying to blend in with the people you are with. So people often have different masks for different settings/people/surroundings. 

With some people/settings I am very chirpy and talkative, in other settings I am very serious and quiet."
"Bending over backwards so that people don't think I'm incompetent, until I hit a burnout."
I literally have no idea - i feel like the mask has consumed me at this point
"In the work environment: very straight and proper, voice changes to a deeper tone, always wearing makeup and looking professional, mono-toned, ultra professional, and hard to joke around with. I come across as a dull coworker.

In social settings: Agreeable (nods at everything), over compensates for what I lack (I tend to over drink/get drunk to come across as highly sociable), pretensive (liking things I wouldn't usually like to come across as neurotypical), easily peer pressured, fake smiles/laughs here and there.

Unmasked: high-pitched voice, over talkative, carefree, obsessive and intense (could talk your ears off about space, the behaviour of birds, mycology) lose my temper significantly, highly emotional, freely stimming, baggy clothes, can go without a bath till evening, generally unkempt, barefoot always..."
"You know what's interesting... I don't even know how to answer this exactly. It's hard to tell what's masking and what's not. I think maybe it's just a toned-down version of myself. Polite, quiet, easily influenced by others to my own detriment. It's also really hard to tell what's a product of social anxiety. There was an earlier period of life where I think my 'mask' was being... cold? Not mean, just very closed off. So many factors there as well, not just being autistic (had no idea I was at the time anyway). I wanted to seem kind of unapproachable because I knew if I seemed a bit more open, I would end up in situations where I didn't know what I was supposed to do. I just wanted people to stay away and I actively put effort into looking vaguely annoyed or sad or just flat and indifferent (also not that difficult when you're struggling with depression). Sometimes I still do that I guess, but not as much as when I was younger. As an introvert, sometimes it's simply about conserving my 'people energy', but the part that's not... the part that's about fear of being ridiculed or hurt or simply confused... it's kind of soul-crushing. I still have a lot of trouble being assertive."
"I have different ones I wear depending on my environment.. 
- Bubbly, social, curious, excited
- Intimidating, strong, knowledgeable
- Caring, soft, maternal 

In reality, without a mask.. I'm loud, I'm anxious, I'm all over the place. I'm scared, I don't know half the shit I act like I know. I'm worried, I'm insecure. I am extremely direct but also, I am constantly in my head over analyzing everyone and everything. Especially myself. Did I say it right? Was I acting appropriate? 

Sadly I grew up in a family who have made me wear those masks for years, that now when I put them on it makes me break inside.. My boyfriend, now fiancé was almost shocked at the type of person I was when the mask came off and we really had to work through that."
"My mask is kind and bubbly, as if I love to talk to everyone and be nice. I actually don’t. I like being kind to the people I love but I present myself as happy-go-lucky in most situations even though that’s not the real me."
"I have no idea, as I don’t consciously choose to mask or unmask.

In the past, my mask has dropped when I was experiencing more brain fog from Long Covid. I didn’t feel any different, but people sure reacted differently, as I suddenly seemed to rub so many people the wrong way. I think my communication just got more detailed and direct, but I’m not 100% sure about that.

I think that I feel more like myself when I’m masking, as this conforms more to my own self-image, so I feel like masking is worth the costs to me. My bad starting issues (from ADHD + ASD) have a much larger impact on my life than any issues related to social situations or masking."
"A friend of mine described my masking as this: 
It’s weird seeing you in different settings because it’s like you’re acting out a different character in different situations. Sometimes when you’d have bad days, the character would slip up and I could tell that I shouldn’t push your buttons. 

I would describe it as this: role playing depending on who the people around me are. I do not typically role play around my closest friends."
"My mask is quiet and aloof, though I'm not aloof and not trying to appear that way."
"Even keeled, calming, steady-eddy vibes. I'm always surprised when I'm told that at work."
"I'd say my mask is literally zero personality. It's only able to talk to people about them, rather than about myself too and answering questions always in a way that would please the other person than to be true to myself. It's a doormat and someone who is constantly trying to stay neutral or positive in order to never anger anyone. (It caused me to have a massive constant existencial crising throughout my whole childhood and growing up)"
"So... mine is in flux as I'm trying to grow tf up, but my base material was crafted as a teenager who was hanging out with a lot of teenaged boys, and my god. It's shitty. I don't take things seriously, I rib people, I'm kinda mean. 


I am at an uncomfortable point in my life where I realised that sucks around three years ago and I've been trying to do better, but I don't ""get"" the social cues of my new social groups so I'll mimic their bubbly supportiveness to try and be ""nice"" but it's horribly fake and awful. I'm not really sure who I am underneath, which doesn't help.


Since ditching as much of the Lad persona as possible, I've been called knowledgeable but imposing, which I thought was cool at first, but now I think is shorthand for aloof. I know I enjoy encouraging people, but I also have this strong sense of what's right and I'm in constant battle trying to puzzle out when it's okay to voice any of that. 


Increasingly I feel like real life wants me to be bland as bland can be, but then I try that and I'm insufficiently engaged (and driving myself insane by biting my tongue and having to deal with the consequences).


In short, my mask is: in tatters. I am barely functional at work and in public. -_-"
"Edit: when I say “weird”, it’s by NT standards or I’ve been called weird for it; I’m not passing judgment or calling it weird myself if that makes sense?

I feel like there’s different levels of it and it’s all one mask, but to different extremes

1. Bubbly and hyper attentive to others needs - most masked version is overly polite and smiley and doesn’t talk much out of fear of interrupting or making people think I’m weird. People who have only seen this tend to think I’m dumb and shallow. Very minimal stimming allowed (NT stimming)

2. Mildly aggressive but jokes a lot and reassures everyone I’m not mad by smiling a lot - when I feel like I can let go a little and relax on the constant tone and comment policing. I won’t stop myself from doing the “hand thing” (I tend to find myself my wrist back and forth to stim) if really stressed or excited. I may rock a little or let myself rock a little if there’s music on and I tend to let my humor out a little more

3. Friend zone - people outside the friendship zone that observe me with a minimal mask think I’m an aggressive, occasionally cranky, overshare-y, and rude; even when I’m in a perfectly good mood. Here I don’t paste on the act nearly as much and only to communicate the bare minimum socially. I don’t smile nearly as much and my voice tends to be more monotone or even coming across as aggressive apparently, but I’ll still throw in laughs or social nods and vocal cues to show I’m listening. I’ll allow myself to stim a lot more with some of the weirder ones like tapping or shrugging and my sense of humor is more pronounced. Most people who see this version of me are either ND themselves or I’ve known for years and years or my husband, not even then I try to keep the stimming within a “quirky” zone

I don’t feel like I’m able to unmask past 3 even with my husband without being misunderstood often enough that I have to explain myself a few times a day. Luckily he’s very understanding but I prefer to just have some alone time to “get the wiggles out and recharge” so to speak.

I can’t do a corporate, professional mask and different levels of what I wrote above is the best I can do for better or for worse and took me until college to be able to reliably do more than suppress stims. 

Even now, at my most masked, people view me as eccentric and kind of goofy. It’s a weird realization that despite my best efforts, I’ve only been able to convince NTs that I’m, at best, a lovable weirdo. I can’t pass as totally normal to save my life"
"Oh... People pleaser and ""mimic"". I sort of mirror the tone and body language of whoever I'm talking to. Usually to the point where I don't know what *I* would actually want or do."
"Customer service persona. Higher voice,very friendly, people pleasing, seeking harmony even if it's bad for myself. Thanks the universe, I am able to change that and am more and more myself. Still friendly if warranted but I can stand up for myself way better now at 45. Took me a very very long time to be able to though. My unmasked self is asking a lot more uncomfortable questions and isn't tone policing as much. I also allow myself to consciously be ok with it if I have a moment of situational muteness. My masking self would have endured way more smalltalk from strangers to be polite, to fulfill societal expectations. My unmasked self is more on the leave me alone, I don't want to talk when I don't feel like it side. "
"I am pretty unmasked these days, but grew up very high masking and excessively people pleasing. I would laugh at things that I didn't find funny. Agree with whoever was in front of me even if I didn't, to the point I really didn't have my own views, opinions, values etc. I would purposely use self depricating humor to get ahead of being mocked or bullied and come off as not caring. I would deliberately sexualize myself to feel in control of it since I came to realize people would sexualize me without my consent anyway."
"My mask is bubbly and aggressive. Not peppy by any means, but unmasking has made me progressively more shy."
"I was talking with my husband about this and he said, ""competition"". He went on to say, ""I think you go into your 'competitive little asshole mode' (TM) because then there are rules"".


This man y'all, he knows me better than I know myself at times. 🤣"
"I've developed a nice one called ""blunt amiability with an edge of wry humour."" Works for most situations, particularly work and interfacing with people while out in public.

Though honestly I've been mask dropping in public way more now. Headphones when I shop, flat affect or dancing to myself while waiting for the bus. I just don't have the energy to keep it up all the time, and I don't have the energy to care what people think of me. Weird to think of exhaustion/burn-out as freeing, but it has been in a way."
"Suppressing my opinions as hard and as long as possible. I'm the kind of person who says every thought that pops into my mind and plenty of my observations are not the most forgiving of people, so most of my masking is keeping my mouth shut but still being kind. I'm never really friendly though, just kind and polite and an attentive listener. I'm not the type to approach people to start conversations."
"Mine is being polite, friendly and non-judgmental. I naturally am antisocial, find people extremely irritating and judge them relentlessly. But my poker face and small talk skills are so good now, no one knows anymore until I trust them.

I only learned to mask well in my mid 20s. I have my own moral code and tend to punch up - I love to bully bullies. But I’m glad I have better control of myself now and don’t make so many people uncomfortable without trying to."
"Phew, still fleshing this one out as someone who’s been masking for 50 years. Fawning and people pleasing just about killed me so I need to unpack that. I laughed at the above “Satan” gif because that totally resonates!!"
"I figured out I could tell jokes and be charismatic. It’s silly how these traits are seen as rare and revered in people, because you can literally watch someone, learn to do it, and turn the switch on or off at will. I know to some people that would make me sound like a sociopath, but I’m a very empathetic person who just had an intense social learning curve. Hopefully other autistic people get that."
Mine is usually this: Be funny!!!! Be “nice”!!!!! Enthusiasm!!!! “Thank you”s!!!! Exclamations for all!!!!
"I mean it changes depending what I need to be safe and fit into an environment. But my work mask which is the highest of my mask and the most used. 

I change my voice, attitude in the way I express my thoughts etc, and way I speak ( using a better vocabulary) face is masked to appear approachable, and not have rbf, more engaging I guess, replying to things I wouldn't or ask things just for the sake of it. (Like how's your week etc) 

And basically just pushing all the autism down till it's so far down it drags the rest of me into burnout."
My mask is ~people pleasing nice lady~
"I have a different one for every group of people I know. My main ones are the “strong, unbothered, rational intellectual who doesn’t care what anyone thinks” which I put on with my family, and “go with the flow free spirit who doesn’t mind not having a plan and can be spontaneous” which I put on with most friends."
"Submissive people pleaser/eternal ""good girl"" with an anxious avoidant attachment style to anyone who has perceived power over me 🙃"
"My mask default is warm, attentive, considerate, friendly, with an easy smile. In social situations it reflexively mirrors the expressions and tones of others, so when someone starts talking about something awful they're going through, I won't still be smiling warmly while my brain is working to process what's being said. 

It was born thanks to 90s sitcoms - I learned to laugh convincingly when I heard the laugh track without needing to understand or even pay attention to what they were saying."
"Invisibility, I hope. This is me when someone I don't know walks into the room, or even worse, the elevator at work. 

https://preview.redd.it/9oswebbvrclc1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e30a7aba4648b017bfff417e591e8dfd2ece808"
"Mine depends on the scenario but mostly hinges on being agreeable,  keeping all my opinions to myself, never rocking the boat, and trying to fly under people's radars. (I've realized my masking is essentially operating like I am under an invisibility cloak.)

Jokes on me because my RBF + this strategy apparently puts off the impression that I am arrogant, intimidating, and aloof LOL. 

All this time I thought I was successfully masking when really I was giving people just an alternative way to dislike me, misunderstand me, and project their insecurity onto me. 

Unmasked I am 'too intense' and 'annoyingly curious' and a 'know-it-all'."
At 38 I'm still evolving. But I no longer take tissues and chocolates to someone's doorstep when they are sad. Efforts have never been reciprocated and it gets a bit sad. I'm very confused.
"My mask is bubbly. It’s like I take my natural energy and enthusiasm and lean into that kinda sweet peppy persona. 

Usually the first sign I’m tired or done is me being flat."
"My mask is a desperate attempt to be invisible. It looks like what people around me look like, but not quite.

On the other side of the mask, the side facing me, is a ceaseless narrative: you’re stupid, everyone can see that you’re a loser, stop moving, stop breathing so much, stop having needs, why can’t you enjoy anything, what kind of human trash hates a birthday party, what kind of low life needs to go home already, stop fucking up, stop fucking up, stop fucking up.

I truly understand why some autistics say it’s a privilege to mask, like being able to work and pay bills is a big deal, but for me it was just the agony of being a useless fuckup until I was 44 and learned about autism."
"My mask is bubbly. It's funny that people say they liked COVID because they could mask less. I feel like I turn it up extra on Zoom calls. Or maybe I just noticed it more during lockdown because that's when I finally started unmasking at home. It's almost like a Zoom meeting is a stage where you have to perform, and once the curtain falls you don't have to anymore.

I'm super early in my diagnosis journey, but I actually don't think people do like me better with my mask. Not to say that they like me without it, but it doesn't make a positive difference either."
"Depends on the crowd and the people and the situation. In front of family, it was a gregarious and cheerful mask. Nothing gets me down!!

At work, it was a happy go lucky, but smiley personality that was also very quiet when not addressed. The type that ignored conflict. 

At parties, I was all smiles and positive but had no personality.

In truth, I'm nothing like all of that but I learned early on to keep everything about me on lock down because I was annoying to be around. Whenever I showed my nervousness or lack of self-esteem, I was immediately stomped on by family. So I learned."
"All smiles. Smiling is one of the ways I can get people to like me and not be uncomfortable around me.

Also being a good listener and always asking questions. If I can keep them talking and ask deep questions. It imitates bantering and I don't have to try to have an uncomfortable back and forth conversation.

I do this with all new people. Once I get to know them, my mask softens more and can socialize more like myself which is less smiley, but very chatty."
"I constantly hum or sing naturally, but I mask that by sliding my teeth together to the rhythm of the lyrics when I’m around other people. 
I hate sitting still in waiting rooms or waiting in line. I fidget constantly to get through it. Mainly, I will do things with my hands or fingers if I have long sleeves that can cover my hands. 
It’s hard for me to not interrupt others when I am excited about something and I have discovered I play with my hair when that happens. My hair is wavy and long so it’s like a sensory playground!
I make myself meet eyes only briefly and then look around the eyes to fake it. I was always forced to make eye contact as a kid, mainly when I was being yelled at.
Smells… I try to ignore it… but it makes me very anxious and sometimes I get a headache. Particularly cigarette smoke on someone’s clothes. Oh my gosh! I kind of end up taking half breath through my nose because I’m afraid to breathe it in through my mouth and then eventually I have to leave the area."
"I also have BPD, so in terms of masks I'm basically Koh the Face Stealer 🙃👍"
"I have been told by people I’ve FULLY masked around that I am this calm, warm hearted person who they feel safe around and that’s always smiling. Unfortunately, my face muscles always hurt after my interactions with them lol. I am a restless, anxious and blunt person who has the ability to completely cater to other people’s energies and needs. It’s exhausting and it makes me feel like I don’t have a real personality."
"I smile and nod and say “hey, how’s it going?!!” And act overly eager and ready to please. I don’t know how to have ANY boundaries (been working on that the past few years) I don’t know how to express what I want/need without crying sometimes or getting upset. People think I’m overly demanding and self obsessed but I’m really just trying to learn how to be an individual and say “no” and take care of myself, bc I’ve been doing the opposite all of my life!!! And still do! I people please like crazy and always thinking of others happiness but others don’t perceive that and think I’m difficult. It’s so weird."
My mask was being a flirty extroverted “manic pixie girl” who was always up for some fun (especially with men) because i didn’t want to seem out of place and it seemed to be what everyone else did. My true self is really introverted and asexual😂😭
"Also stoic and calm, very lowkey and low energy and I only energize and perk up when I feel comfortable"
"I have to add - i thought of myself of being this super friendly chill person. But it turns out I am not and that it's part of my mask. Abrasive and blunt all the way! Walzing through here. Of course I love my daughter and my friends, but when I get irritated or overwhelmed they don't see my mask as much anymore. "
"Mostly to make jokes about everything because I usually feel like I at least don't have to worry about a person realizing I'm weird as long as they think I'm funny first (at least for that social interaction) plus a nice dollop of people pleasing. Joking in particular is something I remember working on for years and years because originally I just quoted shows until people got annoyed with me and then tried telling the same jokes over and over and realized I had to figure out how to be situationally funny.

In a big enough group though I usually shut down because I'll either get interrupted over and over or don't feel like enough people will hear me for jokes to be an effective strategy."
"Very smiley, never argue, listen a lot and never talk about what I really want and with the details I want to tell"
"I dont know anymore. I can’t really remember myself before the seizures started in my early 20s very clearly anymore, now I’m on anti-convulsants that have a somewhat flattening effect, I’ll probably never be able to stop taking them so I’m not sure if who I might be underneath them even matters. I have to consciously make appropriate facial expressions (not always successful because I’ll forget or not be sure what to do), though I don’t know if that’s the autism or the medication cocktail. I have to remind myself other people can come to a different conclusion than me with the same set of facts (theory of mind), though I don’t think that counts as masking, just trying to compensate for an unequivocal deficit in my psychosocial development. I’m still incredibly blunt, when I’ve tried to soften my words I end up pissing people off in a way I did not foresee, only alternative would be not speaking, which I’m still not very good at. I learned from an early age to be fascinated by eye color so I’m more examining peoples irises than making real eye contact from my perspective, though if I’m trying to focus really hard on what someone is saying I have to look away."
"Too sensitive, very nice but weirdly defensive when it comes to certain stuff. And sometimes overtly confident or masculine. When I unmask I’m much smarter and confident, plus slightly more girly."
"Cheerful and helpful. It’s exhausting, but it has always provided a safe shelter from the barrage of misunderstandings that occur because of me throughout the day. Plus it paved the way to social acceptance, so I can’t let go of this winning strategy now. 

My most cozy neutral face is a repellent for pleasant people, and if left to my own devices I ruminate and tend to be pessimistic."
My mask tries to mirror the people I'm trying to fit in with. I realised this never worked anyway and ended up in friendship groups where I wasn't wanted. Thankfully I now have lots of neurodivergent friends in my life and I'm working towards being comfortable and confident in myself again. It's hard work
"I feel like I have been unmasked for a while now, unintentionally. I think I may be in a state of burnout but I don't have a choice in working or not so I get up and go but I'm very quiet, I eat in my car, I have no joy at work and avoid everyone because I'm so depressed. 

When I was still masking, it would change depending on who I was with. Usually I would try to be very agreeable, go with what others wanted and do things for them if they asked. That is not possible for me to do anymore. It's not sustainable for me so, to avoid letting others down later I've been declining helping them at all to save my energy. It feels really selfish, and I've lost my older sister over this. 

It's been painful and sad"
People pleaser x a million.
"Mine is shy but friendly, I’m not a shy person, I just get selectively mute, but people assumed I was shy since I was a kid so I let them cause it was easier than trying to explain. But I still try to be very polite to people, and a lot of people find me easy to talk to so I roll with it. But when I’m low mask and not trying to the nice, people tend to find me passive aggressive or condescending at best, a bitch at worst."
"I'm getting better at respecting my sensory issues, but when it's a formal gathering such as a dinner party I just dissociate cuz I'm done with lights/the music/the small talk/the food smells. Instead of allowing myself to take breaks I'll just stick it out and then need 10hours in my room to recover. Guess it's my ""ignore sensory needs to be socially adequate"" mask and I need to find a better way"
Chatty friendly flirty and cool/calm….
My mask is a mirror. 
"I stay as quiet as I can and only chime in to people please. Any real personality doesn’t exist for this version of myself, I usually end up mirroring whoever I’m talking to."
Mine is a personality that the other person will like. It changes from person to person.
"I don’t know. I’m different with everyone, I feel like I’m constantly chameleon-ing against my will. I can’t really choose when to mask, it just happens."
"My mask is “chill, keeps to themselves” person but I’m naturally bubbly and talkative and silly."
"Bubbly and smily. I put a lot of effort in making sure I am perceived as nice. I even pitch down my voice and control my sneezes. Mostly I try to channel the way I can be when I’m with my husband or when I’m talking about a special interest.

But the moment I just be myself, which is unsmiling and talking less, but still joking with a deeper tone and a bit of vocal fry, everyone thinks I’m an angry asshole. Picture Barbie transforming into Aubrey Plaza."
"Different makes for different situations. I feel like at times I'm just a sponge that absorbs other's personalities or a mirror but overall, my mask is being way too chatty (I've been told by q therapist it's a coping mechanism to social anxiety to avoid being misunderstood) but I think the chattiness is my way to convince myself I won't suddenly become non verbal. At work my colleagues call me chatty in a playful way and when I have silent episodes they know it's a symptom that I'm in total brain fog. So yeah, I hope that answers it"
"my mask is being “bubbly”. i remember being told constantly how bubbly and nice i seemed. basically i was always smiling and quiet and letting people talk at me. since i stopped masking i have not been described that way at all 😅

now it seems like i get men who think i’m angry??? i’ll answer a question and the man i’m talking to raises their hands up at me.  doesn’t happen with women. i don’t get it."
"I'm cheerful, bouncy, friendly and reassuring in my customer service job. 

I won't say it's a persona I dislike, but my husband and I can sit in peaceful silence for half an hour or more at a time, and it's so soothing."
"One of my masks is ""the outgoing social extrovert“ and another one is „hustling startup entrepreneur“ and they‘re both so exhausting, I don‘t know why I do this to myself."
"My mask is goofy eccentric lady with a big smile and chatty. If I'm not masking, I'm a lot calmer and quieter strangely enough!"
"Mine is “normal lady adult human.” Just a regular, grownup who dresses like a grown up and drinks coffee and doesn’t mention robots, video games, time travel, or cartoons."
"i am very shy, so i try to come off as sweet neurotypical shy instead of awkward, socially inept shy lol"
"I’m normal is go-go-go energetic be all things to all people. However I am also stoic and calm

The first is an excellent mask for my general life imposter syndrome. The second is the mask for the insane chaos that is my brain."
"Very smiley, never argue, listen a lot and never talk about what I really want and with the details I want to tell"
"I dont know anymore. I can’t really remember myself before the seizures started in my early 20s very clearly anymore, now I’m on anti-convulsants that have a somewhat flattening effect, I’ll probably never be able to stop taking them so I’m not sure if who I might be underneath them even matters.

my mask is being silent. only speaking when spoken to pretty much
"Mine is somewhat boring, talking about anything but my special intrests, making my facial expressions and tone more ""expressive"""
"Hejtuję każdą, ktora wygląda jak sklonowana z Charkowa.
Nie lubię tej architektury i jeszcze bardziej nie lubię osób, które się nią zachwycają, bo to ah oh, stolyca.
Hejt start ;)"
"I was naturally animated, friendly and energetic as a small child and then somewhere I became extremely shy and withdrawn. Probably from fear/bullying. I learned to mask (which I thought was just coming out of my awkwardness) when I was in my 20’s and worked a lot of customer service jobs. I can be overly agreeable to my own detriment so I guess I’m kind of a freezer and a fawner."
"It's so hard, I don't even know what the mask is anymore after 45 years.

I work remotely but attended an all day in-person meeting yesterday.  My goal was to not say anything negative/weird.  I did great, then the last 5 minutes of the meeting someone suggested that we start using Slack, and I went off on how I really feel about that kind of thing, which is that I hate it.  Then I reply my mistake on the drive home. 

Oh well, maybe next time."
I don’t I always tell the truth and people tell me it’s easy to tell when I’m lying. Unfortunately a lot of people don’t like me and think I’m weird/too negative as a consequence.
"Recently tried to drop my mask.... had most people I love question why I am being moody or off with them. I could honestly scream, for years they all told me ""just say no"", ""set boundaries "".... but as soon as I do I'm now hard work and moody.... the mask is fully back on now 😆 ! 
My mask is always overly polite, helpful and basically anything to people please 😁😁😁😁"
"Mine is either RBF and ""mean""/anti-social OR bubbly and goofy. 

Mostly I just have a very dark sense of humor"
Mine is ADHD.
Mine is customer service 💀
"I mostly act stupid or ditzy. I crack silly jokes at my expense. I hide a lot of the things that I know because I want people to be comfortable around me. But I also want to connect on a shared bit of knowledge so I get kind of sneaky with it.

For example, I’ll be taking to someone who knows a lot about …cuisine. And I want to talk about how I do my cooking I’ll be like, “I like to set everything up ahead of time, you know, like that French phrase…?” “Mise en place?” “That’s it! Thanks!” Now they know I have a certain level of knowledge and I don’t feel like I’m coming off as a know it all or show off. 

I also hate being put on the spot so it’s better that people don’t question me about things until there’s more trust. After that they can’t get me to shut up."
Nice- chatty…
"my mask is all smiles at everyone. maybe slightly animated. calm and composed. very ""sunny"" vibes. extra understanding."
"My mask is competence - I’m naturally very bubbly so I have to counterbalance it with being helpful, competent and knowledgeable"
"I thought for the longest time I was being stoic, till I got my diagnosis and realized it was maybe more of a people pleasing kind of person who just took everything silently and dealt with it alone later. Although I can unmask around a couple friends, I still try to act this way. Even though a lot of therapy for late diagnosed autistic folk includes the encouragement of unmasking, I still feel the need to be this way as I truly do believe in the stoic philosophy of not letting others know my inner workings. It’s none of their business imo lol"

So true!!! Like I know I probably won’t ever be happy so at least I can make someone else happy and have a little pride (idk if that’s the right word to describe it) in the fact that I let someone else get satisfaction

"Mine is a poodle jumping through a hoop people pleasing kind.  

I hate it."
"My mask is calm and collected, I don’t show emotion, I don’t ask for anything or advocate for myself, no stimming. I basically “corrected” everything I was made fun of or criticized for."
"My mask is calm and collected, I don’t show emotion, I don’t ask for anything or advocate for myself, no stimming. I basically “corrected” everything I was made fun of or criticized for. Naturally I’m usually a pretty energetic, emotional, talkative, stimmy, opinionated, and passionate person."
"Polite, very forgiving. A bit of a doormat like others are saying.
I don't think I'm a nice person - I can be kind, but I can also be very petty and vindictive. I mostly don't want to be as nice as I often am, and although I can act nice and do kind things, I usually do it because societal pressure and expectations, or because it's easier to just smile and nod, not because I *want* to. 

Also sarcasm - I'm very honest and blunt naturally, and although I love sarcasm and humour, Im pretty sure it's part of my mask."
Clown. I figure if it's me asking people to laugh at me than they aren't doing it because I'm awkward
"My mask is hyper bubbly, always smiling, never sticks up for herself, never wants to inconvenience people even tho they inconvenience me. 

I’m exhausted and I’m slowly trying to unmask, but it’s really hard. I don’t even know the real me after 32 years of wearing this mask.

Edit to add: I call it my customer service act."
Idk if it's my mask or my personality at this point but the best way I can describe it as Nanase Sakura from 恋はつづくよどこまでも (An Incurable Case of Love)
"i just make myself smaller and try not to be noticed. i only speak if spoken to most of the time. it's not even intentional, i'm just too used to it at this point. i used to be the opposite"
"Confidence, sarcasm and being smart. Not that I'm not those things, but there's a way to make it a shield. It's hard to sort it all out still, but sometimes instead of too much masking, not caring what others think just became part of me"
"My mask is either being very calm and stoic like yourself (withholding expressions, thoughts etc) or having an obviously fake smile on my face too ensure people believe I really am happy for them even though my obviously fake smile is fake."
All the doormat stuff plus laughing and smiling. I hate it. I can’t stop laughing and smiling.
A people pleaser
"Haven’t been officially diagnosed however my last batch of friends would often tease me for being overly emotional and loud. My voice would increasingly get louder when I expressed enjoyment and excitement. They would suggest I’m autistic and didn’t know it. 

I wouldn’t let it bother me but what did bother me is they associated autism in a negative way, I guess, it felt like that anyways. Since then I have trained myself to be calmer and less expressive. I often feel my mask slips when people ask me too many questions about myself or why I am too serious. 

I have a person who currently asks me repeatedly if I’m okay and seems to question my mannerisms and suggest I must be nervous. This in turn, makes me more nervous. Maybe my mask is really bad. Or maybe I’m just totally a nervous wreck with no sense of identity."
Happy & helpful
"Urgh, mine is a people-pleasing comedian, who makes jokes to make people like her. 
Now I've realised it I can hear myself do it, and I'm trying to stop but it's so ingrained in me after 40+ years of wearing it."
"My mask was bubbly, friendly, perfectionist people pleaser who always tried to appear like I knew what I was doing and had my life together, even though underneath it all I was in shambles. 

Unmasked me is unfiltered, says whatever is on my mind, doesn’t people please, advocates for and accommodates needs, doesn’t worry about others opinions or trying to blend in, stims freely, doesn’t apologize for being weird, and isn’t afraid to take up space out of fear of being “weird” or “too much”. 

That being said, there are times where I intentionally put the mask on in order to make my life easier, but now it is a conscious choice instead of a learned involuntary thing. Any time I choose to mask though it does take a significant amount of spoons or cognitive energy and I have to have recovery time after."
"Honestly though, what is a mask and what is a persona? Because everyone has different personas for different social situations, including NTs. I sure as hell hope my colleagues are more easy going and fun with their friends than they are at work!

When I told my friend I'd had an autism diagnosis she asked me if I mask and I didn't know how to respond. I do know it took me way longer to learn socially acceptable behaviour than for most people. And that some of the things I might want to say or do I shouldn't. But I don't really know if that constitutes ""masking""."
My employer has told me I have a stoic exterior but I know she means my mask. People that are close to me can see through it but it’s definitely a mask that has made me unapproachable by default
"Shy, because I carried on with my studies. I couldn't register information in classes, but I had to do good in school, I was supposed to study to get good grades basically, the rest was details... So I started young studying a lot because I needed to learn the things that I couldn't learn in class... And being shy (quiet) was the way to not expose myself as being a brick wall in school. So I carried on as the very shy good student. College was bad, but I got through, then found an easier access Masters (because my college grades were not good anymore), but it was a good Masters. Being more specific studies now, i did much much better with hard work. Then I did a PhD. But social skills were always lacking because... autism... plus fear of being ""exposed""... So it was always easier to pass as shy (as in, to shut up...).

A decade later, I completely turned out and I have not been able to do anything (much less recover) for two years already. So do not follow my example!!!! I also only found out that I'm autistic when I turned out. But deep down I kinda suspected at times in my life..."
"My mask is ""adult and composed""! When I was a teen I made my own choices and lived like an adult, worked, had almost only adult friends and I was very polished and composed (just like I saw on tv shows and how my mom taught me). Now, I find that unmasking, for me, means recovering those part of myself I used to find childish and shame-worthy and trying to live them out as I can"
Does anyone ever feel like they’re being filmed/watched/recorded all the time?
I do not remember writing this comment
"Me too. My thought process has always been that I’m going to be uncomfortable regardless, so I might as well go along with what other people want because that way at least someone is happy.

I’ve really been trying to set boundaries and voice my actual opinions and needs, but it’s been tough after 30+ years of masking."
This is too self-aware and unfortunately I can relate.
"Relatable. I'm getting better tho. Part of it is realizing that when I say no, I'm not causing conflict, I'm enforcing boundaries. 
  
The conflict that comes from me saying no often belongs more to the person I'm saying no to, than to me."
me too! trying not to do this and trying to be more assertive is killing me but it will be worth it
"I was trying to explain this to my therapist and I don’t think I did a good job. But, yeah, you said it."
Jeezzzzz….i didn’t need to be called out in the first comment I saw lmao. 😂
"This is so real. I don't know who I am as a person anymore because this mask runs so deep. I have no preferences because my entire life has just been guided by whoever I'm with so that they won't hate me for things I can't control. If I can at least make sure they always get what they want, then maybe they won't mind keeping me around even though it's me."
Ugh same here. It is exhausting.
![gif](giphy|USxvsVthGt6H36lhHm)
The comments are making me feel so seen. Thanks everyone.
Same same same 😩
"Yes, this! I have been a people pleaser. Now I’m not sure who I am. I have spent my entire life trying to make everyone around me happy. "
Same
Fucking same
"Yup. Been there, done that.
...
Still there, still do that..."
"sometimes i wonder if i actually AM a good person, or if im just “acting.” i feel like i have good morals and treat people well, but if i go against my own opinion to do good, am i? i relate to this though. i agree to things i know for a fact i don’t want to do and wouldn’t change my mind about. being nice to people is exhausting but i can’t accept people not thinking im nice. you don’t have to like me, but i’m not gonna give you any reason to not think i am nice. is that entitled?"
"Same. I trained myself at a young age to always smile because I scared other kids when I didn't. I was the silent, big, and tall girl so people always expected way more out of me than my peers even though I was one of the youngest kids in my class. I've tried unmasking in recent years, but it's so ingrained in me to be like this that I just can't stop."
"The fuck, are you my long lost twin??"
This!!!
Samesies
"Hi, are you me??"
Same. That's why I rarely go out.
This. This right here.
❤️
"I’m the same. Some examples are:

- goofy intellectual around my school friends
- snarky pop culture expert around my work friends 
- helpful Snow White around my family
- 90s standup comedian around my husband’s friends

The worst day of my life recently was our mendhi. All of the above groups in one room. I had no idea “who to be,” and the notion that they all might be “comparing notes” on me was terrifying.

The realization of how *much* I mask and how compartmentalized my life is and how confused I was about who I really was became a huge part of the reason I sought an autism diagnosis (I’m an adult living in the US so… tbd on *that*)"
"This explains high school so much more than “an unstable sense of self”. Like I mean, okay, it is unstable. But it’s unstable bc I literally won’t have a single friend if I’m my authentic self. 

So I became a chameleon. I could hold good friends in pretty much every circle except the “popular” kids and it’s bc I didn’t understand their social games. Jocks? Love ‘em. Nerds? Absolutely love ‘em. Stoner kids? My best friends. “Normal” kids? Well, I’m far from it in every way but I can put on a face of normalcy too."
"It's called code switching, everyone does it to some extent. You know, 'acting appropriately' for the situation. You talk to your parents and family one way, another way to friends, another to work.

However, to me masking feels more like I am hiding, putting on a face that is never really me, just an aspect that I take on and when I put it off I am exhausted and wrung out from the effort. I used to work retail and people loved me there, but now I can really tell when I put on my retail face. Last time I did it I was a little creeped out by myself because it felt so far from how I really felt."
"Yes, I see myself as a chameleon, I blend and adapt and change."
"Yes, I'm the same. 

In group settings, I'm usually really quiet, because I'm fighting my natural urge to blurt out random observations as they occur to me or announce when something doesn't make sense. I also put a lot of energy into keeping a pleasant expression on my face, because if I don't stay on top of it, I tend to absolutely broadcast what I'm thinking, wince when someone is too loud, scowl or have RBF.

With strangers, I force myself to be friendlier and more talkative, but that also increases the odds of getting flustered because I said something weird or wrong."
But then come incompetent anyway by Social standards of course because of said burnout thus seems like a vicious cycle
"Excuse me, are you me? In all seriousness, I’m so sorry, I know how exhausting this is. Imposter syndrome is awful."
What do you mean by bending over backwards D:
This right here
Barefoot always 💕
"I'm like this as well. A mix of introvertedness, social anxiety, masking, etc and I don't know where one ends and another begins. I've been told I'm standoffish, stuck up, and hard to get to know because I'm not bubbly and friendly appearing. Then I feel misunderstood.  I am also am afraid of getting in situations where I wouldn't know how to respond or act. I still have a lot of fear in how people would respond to me, so I keep interactions to a minimum."
Aw I am afraid to unmask. My husband thought I don't care what others think. I was like omg you don't know me at all. That is a defense mechanism to pretend so hard and do something so it would seem that way. But it's a lot of energy. I started with being very clear about my sensory preferences
Same :/
Same
Same!
"Same. This almost always gets mentioned in my annual performance reviews anywhere I've worked. While inside, I'm screaming and feel like my world is going to shatter at any given moment."
Me to a tee.
"This is super relatable. Last year as a 30 something engineering professional, I came to the realization that I wasn’t taken seriously and everyone thought I was younger than I am because my mask was crafted between 18 and 23 or so and I’ve had a very hard time “evolving” it to be pleasantly boring like everyone wants me to be"
"Hi! Fellow ""loveable weirdo"" here! But I have been the masked ""good wife and mother"" for 25 years (I didn't know I was masking, just trying to survive in a confusing world). I think all my loveable parts got sanded down and now I'm just an anxious, depressed mess of a human. This is definitely a nature AND nurture thing and I find I am in an environment where it is nearly impossible to heal from these self and society-imposed rules and regulations. Trying to become a human BEing as opposed to a human Doing is difficult when you are married to a workaholic capitalist who ties worth to productivity he can benefit from. I'm so stuck and just concentrating on remaining calm and stable. But I can't seem to figure out how to move forward in a way I find fulfilling. Hell, I can't figure out anything at this point. Would like to find a way back to goofy and light but everything feels so heavy."
I really relate to your different levels. It’s so comforting to see some of ourselves in another’s words. Thanks for sharing.
"I call this my Oscar winning chameleon mask... It sucks. I'm currently trying to smile less just because I realize I don't ACTUALLY feel like it. Small changes, takes time"
"Wooooooow this. I thought looking sexy was me owning my feminine power and now that I'm learning to unmask I literally realized I hate the feeling of makeup, I despise the feel of dangly earrings on my neck, I have had a buzz cut for ages due to my sensory issues, and so I've started to accept my androgynous look which is ""happening"" naturally (:"
"Good for you! :) I'm trying to drop my mask... I don't want to use it anymore. However, it's easier said than done, it turns out. 😂😂😅 I don't have the energy to deal with it either, but I still mask in most public situations. :/"
"Fawning and people pleasing for me, too. I find it's easy, unfortunately, to revert back to doormat mode when I'm around people who were a part of my childhood. It's an interesting but also annoying observation. It's painful to go into autopilot and get stepped all over while (mostly) understanding what's happening. Until recently (I'm 25), I thought my mask was my personality. Now, I'm working on finding myself and being myself."
"Dude! Relatable! A lot of times, I can tell I've been masking if my face is sore after an interaction. Last year, my partner and I stayed with my grandparents for a few days, and we visited with a lot of my family. I remember I kept complaining to my partner and my dad that my face was incredibly sore, but I couldn't figure out why. When we came back home from our trip, I had a meltdown and felt so overwhelmed. It wasn't until I was safe in my apartment that I realized I was masking (a lot) for the visit around my family. 🥴😮‍💨 I was exhausted after that trip."
"This! I'm currently working on finding myself and being myself. It hurts my feelings that I would put *so* much effort into catering to others, but they never did the same for me. :( It was very confusing for a long time until I started learning about the fawn trauma response."
Also I play the very independent female character very well.. strong and independent.. my family would say resilient
"And when I unmask it’s

Same. Until I get to my breaking point then I am ranty mcrant face and then I probably lose my job.
Me neither
"It's very tough after years.

Of course it doesn't help that my tone was policed very hard by my father. If you weren't happy and expressed it you had problems.

I find the following poem to be a helpful reminder.

"Yes and I’ll add that there have been times that I’ve been so desperate to be included that I’d rather be uncomfortable. I rarely do that anymore, but I occasionally catch myself. It truly is so difficult to break away from it. I developed a new mask that suits me better and is easier to take on and off, but the old one still lives inside me."
Sameeeeee
"Thanks, I hate it."
"Yes, boundaries are so important. I'm still learning my balance there. I love this poem about it.

"I'm screenshotting this, I keep saying I will put my boundaries down but then I'm like oh god what about the conflict I can't deal with that so then my boundaries never get put in place. But the way you have phrased it makes me feel like it's my perspective that needs some help"
"Absolutely me!

Now I'm diagnosed I am desperately trying to self advocate. It's a nightmare though as even when I do advocate for myself I end the sentence 'if that's okay, I'm totally okay with another option if it suits people better'

Or equivalent. It's like a compulsion!!! It's genuinely so ingrained that I can't stop people pleasing!"
I keep repeating “no is a complete sentence”. I know it will click one day.
"It's so important, and if people can't handle it then they don't deserve to be in your life. I've had to learn that being kind does not mean that I can't be assertive.

"I you wonder, you’re a good person. Bad people don’t wonder ❤️"
I’m game for that!
"I've been thinking about this a lot lately. As a kid, I used to categorize my friends by the activities we did together like this:

* Friend A: Quiet, intellectual, and the ""good girl."" The friend I could practice being quiet and well-behaved around.
* Friend B: Goofy and outgoing. The friend I could stim around to my hearts content and never feel judged. She recently told me as an adult she was diagnosed ADHD.
* Friend C: Quiet, shy, and obsessive about interests (her thing was SpongeBob). The friend I could discuss special interests with for HOURS. The only friend I had who didn't think my obsession with the Game of Life board game was weird AF for an 8 y/o.

\[edit\] editing to add that occasionally when all friends would be together, it was super awkward. I usually ended up just being shy/quiet or super loud/rambunctious because I couldn't figure out how to be."
"The compartmentalizing is so real… and exhausting! My worst day was the day of my wedding rehearsal. I have three separate FAMILIES due to divorces and so on. When they collided along with my wife’s family, it was so overwhelming. Add to that all the attention I was getting and I just wanted the night to be over."
So for a very long time I have been like can my versions of myself overlap a little more? That was my focus in therapy
I love the way you described those! 90s stand-up comedian for your husband’s friends. SO relatable!
"OMG, this is why I was always wildly uncomfortable whenever my different friend/work/family groups inadvertently overlapped a few times in my life! I keep people and groups compartmentalized and never want them to meet. My husband and I eloped in part because the thought of everyone being in the same room together was horrifying, and I wouldn't know how to act or what they would say to each other about me. I had no idea other people felt this way as well!"
"The compartmentalizing is so real… and exhausting! My worst day was the day of my wedding rehearsal. I have three separate FAMILIES due to divorces and so on.

"> The worst day of my life recently was our mendhi. All of the above groups in one room. I had no idea “who to be,” and the notion that they all might be “comparing notes” on me was terrifying.

I'm assuming you meant ""wedding""?

I relate to this *SO* much! I absolutely dreaded my wedding because it brought so many circles of my life together, and for reasons I couldn't explain at the time I found that horrifying! But man, you nailed it, that is exactly the reason why! That it will be found out I'm not a ""real"" person and just faking everything. I currently have the same fear underlying having guests over (what if their perception of me is different than the story my living space tells?!) This is such a specific fear that I've expressed to others before but they don't seem to get."
"Yes!!  This why I’ve ALWAYS hated when my different circles collide. When it comes to social interaction, everyone needs to stay in their assigned context or my brain short circuits. (Also I wear almost the same masks as you, only instead of “snarky pop culture expert” I’m “snarky political/social commentator”"
"OMG, this is why I was always wildly uncomfortable whenever my different friend/work/family groups inadvertently overlapped a few times in my life! I keep people and groups compartmentalized and never want them to meet. My husband and I eloped in part because the thought of everyone being in the same room together was horrifying, and I wouldn't know how to act or what they would say to each other about me. I had no idea other people felt this way as well!"
"I feel as if I could have written this, I'm basically a social chameleon. Do you think that level of compartmentalization is spectrum related? I'm currently seeking a diagnosis, and could use another bullet point."
Oh wow this is so me
"Oh wow! Same! In high school and even college, I felt like I didnt fit into any group and I was nice to everyone, so I just had a lot of friends in different groups. I liked having a diversity of friends actually! :)"
"Oh yeah, I definitely feel like my sense of self is totally unstable because I’m always trying to change who I am to be liked. Only within the last year have I, through LOTS of work and Aha Moments, actually begun to try to figure out Who I Am, not just who I pretend to be because that’s what people expect of me."
"Pleasantly boring! I love this. I manage my intensity around ppl my age (turning 40 in six months) so I seem ""mature"" but inside I'm 17 forever(:"
"I’m sorry to hear that :(. Would you be able to take some time off from working maybe? I am currently taking a year or two off from working and it has helped me tremendously. Even my friends have commented. Stress can do a lot of the things you’re describing (at least to me!) and I found that a lot of what you described was how I was feeling last spring before I decided to take some time to work on personal projects instead. If that is available or cutting back hours is an option for you, I recommend it. I recognize I’m coming from a privileged position offering this as a suggestion and know it’s not always an option"
"It was definitely an incremental shift for me! I went on antidepressants about 7 years ago, and they also cut down on my anxiety a lot, making it easier for me to ""not care"" about things. I started just by wearing headphones when grocery shopping (so the sensory overload wouldn't knock me out every time 😮‍💨), and found myself feeling less ""in public"" with that aural barrier up. It also helps that I live in a busy city and I know that if I'm stimming or dancing or singing to myself or whatever, I'm still probably not the weirdest thing the people around me have seen that day."
"It’s makes complete sense to revert when around family of origin. And that likely won’t change anytime soon. In my case, I went no contact many years ago. My dx was always CPTSD & trauma, so the neurodivergence was missed until recently. We cope how we need to for survival, but it’s terrible for us. So exhausting."
"Omg yes and I watched a video by Aaron Doughty about speaking from a grounded embodied place, rather than one that’s all up in your head, hungry for approval. That helped me immensely. I was always speaking from my head in a high ungrounded voice that was like so eager for others to approve of me. He described it as people feeling like you need something from them, bc you do, the approval. lol. So I try to remember now to speak from my body/heart and from a place of already having all the validation I need 💯🥰"
Oh my god… that made me cackle. Lol!
😂😂😂
Ah you've met me.
What is your new mask?
"Dope! Lol, for me it came partially through therapy where my therapist was like, ""avoiding conflict can produce conflict, too, just in ways you have less control over.""

Like, if I say yes too much, later when I'm burnt out, people will hold me accountable for not setting boundaries AND I'll be burnt out from all my hustling to please everyone. 

Better to set boundaries, experience friction, and have control over where my energy is spent than avoid conflict through being a ""yes-man"" all the time and robbing myself and my family of my best."
the hardest challenge!
"Keep going! Some days are better than others but the more you do it the easier it gets.

This is my favourite poem about the word no/setting boundaries if you need a little more than that phrase.

thank you 💖
wow i really like that /gen🥺 thank you 🫶🫶
Yup yup yup. Exactly. That confusion over “who to be” in high school when my various friends would sit together at lunch. I’d have just settled into one persona when a new friend would walk over and I remember having to re-strategize my “character.” I’d forgotten about that.
"Oh the ATTENTION! Ugh YES! I hate having the focus on ME. Which is weird because I’m a tour guide? So my job is to be the center of attention but that’s *different,* because I’m infodumping my special interest. Opening gifts, piano recitals, blowing out birthday candles, always hated it."
Hang on … you can do that? I’m in therapy! I’m gonna ask about this!! Thank you! 🏅
"Thank you! 🌟 I basically bank up topics for observational comedy & “dad” jokes before social obligations so that’s probably how that ended up manifesting… I’m going to a birthday party on Saturday (for two hours, my husband has agreed, because I turn into a werewolf when I’m tired and I have to work the next day) - and I’ve already started collecting topics for conversation:

https://preview.redd.it/fkslduf1bclc1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc59ae63485871540bb4e96ffc3774712e38c7ae"
"Oh my gosh that’s so smart - I wish we could’ve eloped but my husband is the oldest cousin in his big, traditional Indian family, and his mother’s only child. She would have HATED me if I insisted on eloping. So we agreed to a wedding, but somehow in my conflict-avoidant people-pleading we ended up with three parties:

Thursday: mendhi (henna)
Saturday: wedding
Sunday: Nikkah (Muslim religious ceremony) 

All of which full of not just people I did know, but also people I’d never met, and all of them ran way past my bedtime, and I was so overstimulated. Eloping sounds like a DREAM. Share details so I can live vicariously??? 🥺"
"The wedding was also awful, but 2 days before was the mendhi and I remember hyperventilating trying to greet all the guests in my various “masks” and feeling my face get hot because I was the center of attention. It was actually a relief to have to spend most of the party sitting off in a corner as still as possible while the artist, a stranger who made NO attempt to chat with me, worked on my henna. Although I did feel like she was annoyed at having to repeatedly tell me to stop wiggling.

In retrospect, the wedding two days later was probably worse. I had no sleep from the previous days’ late parties (“PARTY ALL NIGHT! Woo!” 😒) and I almost fainted. Spent most of my reception trying to assess how mortified I would be if I had to leave my own wedding in an ambulance, and how mad everyone would be at me. Had simultaneous diarrhea AND my period. In a huge gown. AND everyone was there, watching me. So you’re right, the worst day WAS my wedding. At least I ate a couple bites of food at the mendhi!"
"I dont even know how to “find who I am”. Like that concept is whack to me. 

Who am I? I dont know man, i dont know. I’m such an eclectic human being that that alone makes it hard to figure out who I am."
"I think I am stuck in a rut. I stopped working April 1, 2022 to get a handle on my mental health issues. It has been a long ride and I just got my ASD diagnosis less than 2 weeks ago. I was hoping the time off would help but now I have to figure out if my ""issues"" are my own or if I live in an unhealthy environment. Even when working, my husband has been the primary bread-winner. But he just said to me this very morning, ""It's hard being married to an autistic girl."" 

My diagnosis was less than 2 weeks ago. Soooo I am thinking my living environment might not be the best place yet I don't have a better option. If I could stop ruminating over his narcissistic thinking and behaviors I would be better off. I seem to have no control over this anymore.

Thank you for responding. I feel like a spoiled child who has everything she needs but is just miserable. And I have been trying for so long to not be miserable. 13 meds, 2 psychiatrists, 4 therapists, hysterectomy...I fail at everything. The only thing I am getting right is making it to all the doctor and therapy appointments. If progress is moving backwards, I'm on it."
"I get easily overstimulated from the store, too, but I'm always afraid to wear headphones when I'm out by myself. I feel the need to be aware of my surroundings, especially as a woman. But perhaps that's just my anxiety talking. 🙈

I've been wondering lately if I'd benefit from some meds for my mental health. I've been on an antidepressant before, but it was a bad experience. I hesitate to try more meds, but I also feel like I need something to help my sad, anxious brain."
"Ooooo! I like this! :) That's a great way to put it. I'll have to watch the video! I struggle with keeping myself grounded, so I've been doing a lot more mindfulness practices. Yoga's a big one for me at the moment."
"Comfortable, classic, forward 

Those are my 3 style words and they create a mask as well. I got a divorce, switched careers and went back to school so I needed structure with flexibility to accommodate how I’m functioning each day."
"It is very different! I’m a teacher and I can talk to teenagers all day long, but put me in an unstructured setting with strange adults and I am the most awkward person in the room."
100%. I thought I hated attention for years. Turns out I actually thrive there when I'm not forced to mask the entire time.
Omg me too
YES YOU CAN. I got a sales phone job to learn how to be less awkward and more expressive. And I was pretty good at it! But when I walked down the street in real life w my dog I would be anxious and feel like I was trapped. Trying to access that ease and go with the flow a little
"Nearly spat my coffee out reading that text, that's SO FUNNY!! Making a mental note of that one."
lol. I love that.
"Also, being a teacher or tour guide in your work scenarios means those situations have a ""script"" to them. You have a plan going in on what information to cover & how you're going to go about covering said information. 

The social scenarios like weddings where multiple different social groups are thrown together with you at the center is basically an extreme audience consisting of impromptu acting with a judge panel who all value completely different things. Definitely not winning in this scenario"
"THANK YOU!!! I just told it to my husband and he just stared. I repeated the punchline. Explained how you might expect the answer to be “Batman” or maybe like, some violent assault scenario, or maybe even something to do with baseball, but it’s a Mad Scientist joke! He didn’t laugh, but if YOU did, I’m still gonna try it on other people!9"
"It also happened to me. I was in a burnout when my therapist suggested me to look for information about autism because she was pretty sure I was on the spectrum, so the burnout made me too mentally exhausted to mask anyway, or to adapt or manage anything. But, beyond the burnout, being aware of autism made masking harder for me.

I think it's because before, I genuinely tried to fit, to act like the others, I used to blame myself for not being like the others, like I didn't make enough efforts, I wasn't focused enough, I was wrong, lazy, etc, but a part of me thought that if I worked enough to correct my ""flaws"", I could become like the others, like if it was about training and habits.

But realizing that all I was and felt totally matched with the characteristics of the women ASD also made me realize that I can't change some things because it's how I'm made, how I'm wired, how I am. So I guess something in me gave up masking because in a way, it's vain to think I can change and be ""normal""/NT. Masking would only make me miserable, without any guarantee to fit anyway. Even at my best I always was peripheral, anxious and exhausted, people always ended to feel there was something off with me.

Before I had the hope to change if I tried enough, but now I know I can't change, so why waste my energy to not even reach satisfaction?  I'm different, so I should focus on how to adapt to live better and not exhaust myself (=reachable goal), instead of trying to change who I am (=not reachable, or only in a precarious way)."
"Absolutely.  It's like someone informed me I was in a box, helped me out, and now that I'm out I really don't want to get back in."
"This is totally normal, fwiw! 

For me, and for a few others I've seen/spoken to, the experience went something like this:

Pre-diagnosis: masking all or most of the time without realizing it, uncontrollable masking, burned out and drained from the effort, don't know why I feel this way, etc.

Immediately Post-diagnosis: automatic masking starts to fall away, leading to a period of confusion and fear where I wonder if now I can't fit in anymore, if I'm just doomed to be this weirdo all the time. Wondering how am I suddenly more autistic just because I know, and does this mean I'm making it up? Often different degrees of masking during the same encounter, making my behavior seems almost inconsistent and even stranger.

Months and years following diagnosis: Masking simply becomes a more conscious tool. What was once an automatic, often trauma-fed coping mechanism is now a choice that I can make in different situations, depending on the circumstances. I can more deliberately lower my mask around certain friends or family members, and I can let it fall away when I'm by myself, and no longer have to hold myself to NT standards. But in interactions with strangers or new people, I can throw the mask on *if I choose to,* to facilitate the social encounter or keep myself safe in dangerous situations.

Tl;Dr: Totally normal, you're just realizing this mask isn't a thing you have to do, it's a thing you can choose to do. Give yourself some time and patience and it will become less confusing and easier to manage.

I hate that I spent so long feeling like I had to mask. I love that I *have* my mask as an option, now, even as I wish we lived in a world where no one ever has to mask. Sometimes it's tough to have a lot of different feelings about the same thing, but just give yourself space and breathing room and some of this stuff will just begin to calm down. You've just given the snow globe of your mind a huge shake by discovering your neurodivergence -- the snow and glitter will begin to settle soon!"
"Yes, this absolutely has been my experience

I was walking into a grocery store some months ago and saw an old co-worker that I used to be close-ish with. He shouted “Hey u/thepotatoinyourheart!” All that came out of me was an awkward “Hey” before I shuffled past him 

In that moment I realized the person he knew was dead and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to resurrect her. I realized also that I don’t want to resurrect any of my masks as they were constructed to benefit everyone but myself 

I beat myself up a little bit after that interaction for not being more… outgoing? Chipper? Social? Responsive? Basically, all the things I conditioned myself to be so as to not become ostracized or rejected 

Now, I just repeat to myself that I don’t owe anyone anything, especially the people I masked for the hardest. But I do owe it to myself to learn who the real me is and figure out how to show up as her"
"Yea, spent years masking without realising it then when I found out I'm not an alien, it's just autism I thought fuck it.. spent 30 years trying to hide who I was, not doing it anymore and I'm just as weird as I want to be 👌"
"I relate to this so much. I'm still in the early parts of figuring out myself in relation to my autism. By this I mean I know it's exhausting to mask and like you it was more default like ""this is how you act in public"" and now I feel like I have to re-equip my polite interface for every interaction, but I recently came to the conclusion that I enjoy being social... on occasion. So instead of coming home exhausted from unconsciously masking all the time, I make a conscious choice on when to mask. I do kind of approach it with a similar mentality to work, but instead of ""you're going to go to work because you need money"" it's ""you're going to use all this energy because you need some human companionship.""
So when I know it's something I want, something I'm excited for it, then I tell myself to buckle in. Give myself a little pep talk that:
1. Acknowledges that it's a difficult thing to do
2. Tells me that I am capable of accomplishing difficult things
3. Reminds me that I want it

Ex: ""I know you kind of don't want to go right now because of all the anxiety and awkwardnes, but you can do it. You've done it many times before and this time you want to do it even though you know its hard. You know you'll have fun once you get there and are in the mix."""
"Yep. I was recently diagnosed because I was in one of the most severe burnouts of my life. Finding out that so much of that burnout was due to pretending everything was ok for the comfort of others, I quickly developed an antipathy to masking. I've wasted too goddamn much of myself on fitting in and making nice, and I won't bleed anymore for people who don't care or even notice. 

There's a freedom in that, and I'm embracing the fuck out of it. Some people won't like me as much for it, and that's just fine."
"Yes, but also something else. I realized I was drinking alcohol as a way to mask in public or with big groups. Now I just don't go out or to those events because I realize how bad of a crutch alcohol was. I also don't think I can mask without it and I don't want to mask. So I just don't go out"
Everything fell apart when I got my diagnosis.
"That's exactly what it feels like...a wall coming down and I can't bear to mask anymore. I mask as much as I possibly can at work to keep my job, and that's really all I have energy for. I'm starting to realize that I might not be as likeable as I thought in the past and it terrifies me. I spend my days alone, outside of work of course. It gets incredibly lonely, but at the same time, it's where I feel safest. Not sure where to go from here."
"I can barely leave the house because of it. I got a job for the first time in July 2022 after all the pandemic stuff, and promptly attempted suicide. Not because I'm cluster B and trying to get attention, like my last therapist suggested, but because the thought of having to pretend to be someone I'm not every day in the service industry again was too much to bear. But I felt so guilty about not helping out the family that I couldn't just talk to them and quit and get help because I have been working all my life. So many people judge and say I'm just lazy or trying to get out of work or making excuses or whatever. 

Invisible disability and the current diagnostic norms for neurodivergence are really hard to deal with. What other disabilities, besides those having to do with the brain, require self-reporting instead of medical imaging/ technology? Once they start regularly scanning the brain, we will be able to live with some semblance of peace and normalcy. More so than now, at least. Good luck, OP."
"Yes. I think it's because I am not trying to fit in anymore. I'm not searching for that vision of life where I'm a certain person, but I live my own life now. I accept that I'm different and that my path in life is unique and a lot of different narratives I can't fulfill and that's okay. Before I was always restlessly searching, regularly burnt out, trying to fit in and find connection, but now I appreciate the people I can be myself with and I can decide which relationships are good to me. I'm much happier granting myself the space for being myself."
"Yes, I also had this experience. It also came with a profound and aching sadness at realizing all the needless pain I’d been through/put myself through over the decades of my life all because I was trying to chase something that I’d never have (being “normal,” for lack of a better word). 

I mean, I went through some serious trauma that masking made 100 times worse, and I never even realized I was doing it. I never even realized I was making myself worse because of it. 

I really felt like I had to mourn a lot after I discovered I was autistic. And then, once I allowed myself to do and feel that, I was able to start to accept myself and love myself a lot more than I ever could before. And now I’ve even found ways of coping and making my life easier, which I’ve never had before because talk therapy did absolutely nothing for me. 

So it gets better, at least in my experience. Just let yourself feel all the things you need to feel, be it anger, sadness, exhaustion, hurt, etc."
"I feel like
Knowing I’m autistic and reducing the sensory stimuli has left me with more energy to mask. But also, I care a lot
Less to mask around co-workers… but will still mask for customers…"
"Pre-realizing that autism had something to do with it, I was hazed and bullied until I developed a pretty good mask. The issue was that I would lash out at people viciously without warning and feel like utter crap because I couldn’t figure out why they’d set me off. And I mean, I treated some people pretty freaking unfairly and never want to do that again.

I have a shorter capacity to mask now because I’m in tune with when I’m getting into the yellow, orange, and finally red. It’s kind of a trade off. I can afford to be *a little bit rude and short* with people while I basically prevent the disaster I sense from blowing up, and it usually is short lived now, and it’s actually working alright. I think this requires being really attuned to your emotions on an hour by hour basis and also being lucky enough that the people around you don’t corner you. I haven’t always had that. Not everyone has that.

Another hurdle when it comes to masking, I think autistic people tend to stop buying into a thing if they realize it’s arbitrary or stupid and has no value to them. Part of learning about autistic masking is the disillusionment, or realizing people told you all this NT advice that doesn’t fit you and now you’re tired of it all, so you don’t have the energy to fake it when you spend every second understanding that it’s bullshit. Figuring out how to resolve that requires a whole personal journey."
"It's called skills regression and is quite common after receiving a diagnosis. I was describing it as ""an unraveling"" to my husband before I had a clinical term to put to it. Basically everything you've put together to function starts unraveling because you're seeing things for how they really are. This video was really enlightening for me:
https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT88MEYAE/"
"I'm still going through this. I think it's a sort of realization that there was some gaslighting going on, and you're not willing to listen to it anymore. If you ever had a special interest in armchair-level-psychiatry or (actually bullshit) self-help books, you may have noticed a trend with them - they make it sound like EVERYONE should be able to do, think, and act the same way, but you may have learned it incorrectly and with this one neat trick you can be this super-awesome best-est person. Except, it's not a matter of your frame of mind, or perspective, or whatever. No one can really do, think, or act the same as whomever this imaginary ideal person is. To even become 'functional' in our grossly dysfunctional society, folks who are not neurotypical would need a whole different set of 'neat tricks' than the products that are getting peddled. 

This means that a lot of people have been wasting a lot of time and energy trying to be something that we can't be, and then feeling like shit when we don't reach that unattainable perfect self. FUCK. THAT. 

I'm trying not to think of how much pain I brought on myself because I thought that I could fit into society's mold of the perfect person if I just broke a few more of my proverbial bones."
This!!! This this this a million times over!
"Things make a lot more sense now.

I had the realisation/acceptance this year and now things make so much more sense after reading your post."
"I am self-diagnosed (after years of deep dives and watching it become incredibly clear my kids are all neurodivergent, some diagnosed and the others about to be). Once I realized, it was like in tv shows where someone opens a closet door and everything spills out. 

The really weird thing is I can feel my mask sliding on now, but it doesn’t go on fully. Like when the people in the aforementioned tv show shove everything back in the closet and scramle desperately to shut the door. 

The other day I was like a zombie. I have chronic illness/pain and was having the mother of all flares (and pretty sure I’m in burnout), but my teen’s autism therapist was about to arrive to pick us up to take us to my son’s appointment. Literally the moment she rang the doorbell I could feel my body going into masking mode the best it could. It didn’t last, but it was the craziest sensation actually *feeling* it happen. 

I’ve also become extremely aware of things like mimicking people’s phrases, and scripting, especially if I get into a situation where someone throws me off. 

Up until I realized I’m ND, I thought everyone was like this and I was just useless, and not trying hard enough. Meanwhile it was the opposite."
"Yessss! And I notice my awkward body movements a lot more now. I didn't think anything of ""t-rex"" hands before (when I first heard the term, I didn't think I do that), but now I notice that I do it with one hand when I'm using the other all the time, and that I otherwise fidget with my hands constantly, etc... I even walk on my tip toes somewhat often and I'm not sure of what to do with my face when I'm in tightly social settings. I've always known that my mind is very awkward in public, but I didn't notice it in my body as much as I do now. But I *am* less anxious, so there is that!"
"I used to think if I don't behave a certain way then all hell will break loose and everything will be ruined. But then one day I gave up trying to keep up with the society's standards and started behaving like a massive bitch. Always looking out for myself and putting myself on the top of the priority list. And guess what? I'm still here, alive and breathing.
I ended up losing close friends from over a decade and severed several pointless relationships, yelled at people who wronged me, fought back, stood up for myself. And I'd do it again in a heartbeat. The only ones I'm losing right now are the ones not meant for me."
"Masking destroyed me in so many ways. 

Being my genuine self is the kindest gift you can give yourself."
"Yes! I had suspected for years but when it was basically corroborated by my therapist and a psychologist (not officially diagnosed, long story) I started to read up (a lot on Reddit) and learned about masking. And then I started to realize when I was doing it, and being upset I felt the need to do it because screw the patriarchy!! Or… neurotypical-archy! 

And then I let myself just stop doing it. I stopped masking at the grocery store, or in public, and I never had to do it in front of my mom I realized (I know that’s not common for all women and believe me, my granny was suuuuper vocal about my “weird movements”, insisting I sit still like a lady, people were going to look!!). I slowly stopped doing it basically everywhere and it was so liberating! If I need to stim as I wait in line, fine! If I don’t pretend to understand why everyone was crying at the Barbie movie, that’s okay. If I openly say, “I don’t get it. Please explain.” to my friends in chat who make a joke, that’s fine, I’ve found friends who like answering my questions and cluing me in. 

I realize that I’m very privileged to be on the government disability because I don’t need to mask for a job or whatever, and that not all autistic gals have that same freedom, but I definitely encourage you to unmask in every day life activities without shame because it feels like taking a lead vest off of your shoulders sometimes."
"maybe there are activities you can do, or friends you can be around while unmasked? it could help to focus on those things while feeling burnt out / struggling to mask.
like for myself, i’ve been trying to focus on creative projects, being around animals, and either being by myself or with my partner or roommates who i’m most comfortable with."
"I’m 27 and self diagnosed and going through the official process now. It really hit me a couple months ago and since then I have felt the exact same way as you have said. I don’t know what to do now honestly, it feels more exhausting than it ever did before. I knew how rough it was just as I’m sure you do but now it feels impossible and I don’t even know how to talk to anyone about that. I felt crazy honestly until reading this. I’m sorry you’re going through this too, but thank you for sharing it. 🩷"
"It wasn't until a few years after being diagnosed that I was finally accepting that I was autistic and learning more what that means. And for a few years I just really dngaf about pleasing other people or conforming to norms. I was just so tired and burned out and didn't want to pretend like everything was fine anymore. 

I became more brash and direct with management at work and to my surprise (because I had stopped caring for such things) I found that my bosses would seem annoyed every time I had to interact with them. There's a balance to be had so that all my energy doesn't all go to masking and being likeable at work and with saving enough energy for myself to be able to relax and do enjoyable things on my off time. This is a huge learning curve and I'm still finding the balance.. there's a lot of mindfulness and setting boundaries so I don't over exert myself but can still have good relations with other people. Like I keep thinking I wish I could just do work things at work and not have to be best friends with everybody.. like what's the big deal. 🤷🏻"
"It didn’t get harder exactly, I’m just now hyper aware of the stims or other ways I act that are not “normal”."
"So, for me, it made it almost impossible to mask. Which then made it very hard to do a lot of my daily things, like drive. Because, if you learn something while highly masking, and then either stop maskingnor can't mask, a lotnof times you no longer can do the things that you had learned.

So now driving is a once a week thing, where before diagnosis and burnout and losing the ability to mask 24/7, it was my escape. I would just drive and jam to music as a release from stress. Now I have to put the mask on just to drive anywhere. Sucks big time.

And I didn't get diagnosed until 38."
"Yes, I was diagnosed a few yrs ago around 35ish and over time my sensory issues have magnified the more I unmask, keeping the mask on is getting more challenging. Apparently, in order to protect itself during a life of masking, seems like the body can disassociate, almost numbs the full extent of experiencing stimuli. Kind of explains why when I'm in the hospital for pain, I can still speak at a 7 or 8, but once I'm at 9-10 for too long which always happens bc they ignore my words, I end up in melt down mode. 
Unmasking means the vicious nausea came back, similar to when I get extreme burnout except  now I have to take daily nausea meds.  Pain & migraines I've had for yrs now I can actually feel it more. I get dizzy a lot so I'm doing a lot of music therapy & somatic along with some others focused on nervous system dysregulation.

Being late diagnosed masking and the cptsd memory loss on top was a real struggle. Had to learn how to function again for a bit, had some skill regression which increased my anxiety. Honestly was shocked bc my brain started getting neurological spells, freezing, going mute I now happening more often.  Those are things I experienced as a kid & intermittently, now I keep my ESA or a trusted person around. It's wild, but I prefer to have my ear protection in and I like being sensitive to the world idk. I can feel now vs before all super medicated & dazed. Became truky alive on the in and outside."
" Not sure it’s harder per se, but I’m definitely more resentful about it, I guess. And resentful of having to navigate all the passive-aggressive and hidden subtext type stuff. 

Okay, maybe it is harder! Or more exhausting at least."
"To me, it's not that it became harder. It's just that now I'll just think ""oh, I don't need to do this and that just to please them"". And I actually love that for myself."
"I used to think if I don't behave a certain way then all hell will break loose and everything will be ruined. But then one day I gave up trying to keep up with the society's standards and started behaving like a massive bitch. Always looking out for myself and putting myself on the top of the priority list. And guess what? I'm still here, alive and breathing.
I ended up losing close friends from over a decade and severed several pointless relationships, yelled at people who wronged me, fought back, stood up for myself. And I'd do it again in a heartbeat. The only ones I'm losing right now are the ones not meant for me."
"This is a common issue that stems from just how all human brains work. Like sleep anxiety, the more consciously aware of something you are, the more that “thing” takes a toll on you.

Have you ever been injured and not noticed any pain until someone points out the injury to you? Have you ever “choked” while doing something you’ve done well a million times (i.e. something you’ve done a lot, but you start paying attention to what you’re doing, and you mess it up)?

Anything that engages the prefrontal cortex of the brain is just adding another dimension of awareness and process fatigue onto the subjective experience.

You can overcome this by understanding this “meta process” and practicing “integration” of it. Integration meaning that you work on it until it becomes an integral part of the system so that it “feels” like it’s not there anymore. I’m not saying you “should” mask, only that in certain circumstances it may be preferable to, and if you’re gonna mask, why make it harder.

This process of integration is kind of like how the placebo effect works. But people who know they’re receiving a placebo no longer get the beneficial effect. UNTIL, they learn that the placebo effect is “real,” and then even knowing they’re receiving a placebo still gives them a benefit.

The mind is a fascinating system."
"It happened to me too and it has been so much better for my health. My psychiatrist also advised me to reduce social masking and redirect this energy to creative ways to reduce overstimulation. The only place I still mask heavily is at work, but otherwise I've become more and more myself.  And honestly it feels great. 

I recently went to an art exhibit opening of my friend. And I realized I had forgotten how to mask when I was behaving like the silly old me. To my surprise nothing bad happened and I wasn't exhausted like I usually am when I got home."
Yes it also happened to me. I am now much much more insecure about my social skills than before
"I feel the same way as you. It’s like, now I realise just how much of my life I was masking… and thinking about places and spaces I don’t need to mask anymore, the times I have to mask take like an extra toll on me 😓

Like it’s helpful to realise what I’ve been doing and what’s been going on, but also super fucking difficult!"
"Yes! 

I noticed people losing their rags with me a lot more since I stopped masking too. People don't have the patience or kindness to deal with anyone who isn't NT in general. 

They get so personally offended by the lack of eye contact it's weird. 

It took a while to realise they aren't worth shit and don't deserve any control over my life, my happiness and comfort is the most important."
"Ohh yes, I can relate a lot to everything you have said!

I’m 30 and I’m the exact same boat…..I’m so overwhelmed and confused, and more self-conscious than ever now I’m really noticing how I interact with people.

It’s a weird time and I hope it gets better!"
"Absolutely happened to me and very common, so you’re in *great* company!"
"This this this. I’m in a similar point in my journey after a formal ADHD diagnosis and self diagnosis/working with my therapist for autism. It’s also great though cause I can be more thoughtful about managing my “capacity.” For example, if I know I have a lot of socializing coming up, I’ll make sure I work from home more leading up."
"Not harder, I just went ""oh that's what I was doing"" and now only do it for special occasions when I got the spoons for it."
yes 100%
YEP
"i wonder if it was the diagnosis that made masking harder, or if the burnout made masking harder? the burnout helped me find my diagnosis"
"Not really since I’ve known I was autistic since I was 7, it was never a conscious action to mask, it was a method of protection, I guess"
"Yes, I'm noticing it a lot."
"Not exactly. But once I got diagnosed, I made a conscious effort to mask less, so I now come across as ""more autistic"" than before."
Yes
There’s also thing called skill regression once you get a perspective change. Sadly. But you can work back through it
"I didn't realize how much I have stopped until reading your post and the comments here. Yesterday, I think  I offended a neighbor when she asked for our dogs to say Hi and I said no, not this time. They get all excited and jumpy and loud and it stresses me the hell out. As I walked away I thought ""Woah, what was that? Me just being honest about my needs and wants?!?"""
yeah it’s mad.
"YES. OMG. It is causing me issues when I don’t mask around my family, friends, loved ones, etc. because they just don’t like me when I don’t mask nor know how to take it or understand me. It hurts, I feel more myself but cast away and put down by others. It makes me feel like I’m in early elementary school again. Probably because that’s the time before I developed masking my behaviors. Just like- people, I’m fucking weird, accept it or don’t. I’m not going back to shutting myself down, and ignoring my true self just to have you in my life and make you comfortable."
"Burnout led me to diagnosis, after a lifetime of thinking I had subclinical traits. It was so brutal, I actually had an MRI to see if I had a brain tumor or something. 

I feel like for me, it's impossible to unlink the burnout and the reduced ability to mask. I have physically lost skills and capacity, like a battery that has been run down to zero too many times. I am kind of fascinated by the idea of the realization alone leading to reduced masking, but I can't really relate to it, just because of the circumstances of my burnout. It feels like my mask got ripped away from me and shattered, and *then* I found diagnosis along the path of trying to understand what the hell happened. 

Essentially, I lost the ability to play-pretend neurotypical behavior, which led to dx, which led to letting myself have accommodations that my body physically needs without feeling somehow broken or inadequate for it. <3"
"I also feel this way, and recognize that masking adds stress to my life. If accept that I have some social limitations I will hopefully release less cortisol into my body over time. Knowing that masking is literally deteriorating my future health makes me resent it. I’m a mess right now because I’m in the throes of this change, but I think I’m the long run I’ll be better off."

"“You’re in a box.”

“I am? Oh FUCK, I *am.*”"
That’s exactly what it feels like!
"This is so accurate, I’m adding it to my autism master list (I love lists)"
"Thank you so much, this helps a lot! Everything is quite overwhelming right now, so reading this soothes me a lot. <3"
"I came here to comment the same thing. It's totally normal. During diagnosis I had daily meltdowns, was sleeping all the time and nearly burnt out, because I didn't want to mask any more, and it felt like I was trying to climb mount Everest each time I had to mask for work, put on uncomfortable clothes and makeup, look like you're paying attention and smile and write notes and answer e-mails quickly...

It took months before it got better, but it definitely got worse first."
"I work at a grocery store right now which is hell, and I am not forcing myself to smile at anyone there for the first time in my life. I must seem like am in a really bad mood, but I don't really care. I say kind things to customers and mostly it is enough for them, no matching face required. It has been quite liberating"
I LOVE your username.
">In that moment I realized the person he knew was dead and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to resurrect her.

Man that hit me deep. I had an opportunity to introduce my bf to some old friends and couldn’t do it, the me my bf knows and the me they knew is not the same. It would have been colliding two worlds, and one was full of masks."
"Thank you for sharing! It really helps to read this. And I agree: I have to find out who is the real me, too."
"This is so powerful and rings true. That feeling of not wanting to resurrect any of my masks is heavy, because now I feel even more stuck when I try to talk with friends. *Which mask was I wearing for them? Can I switch to an easier one without them thinking too much of it? Why do I even need to keep this exhausting parade going, anyway-- do I even want to speak to this person, or am I going through the motions still, trying to please someone just to feel as if I fit in somewhere, anywhere. Maybe this'll be the friend who really sticks if I don't bother with any mask or fake cheer? Is that manipulative?! What do I do?!""*"
All of this.  YES!
"Happy for you <3 Hope I can get there, too!"
"Omg! I’m in fucking heaven! Sorry HP. Yes, yes and yes. Thank you."
"This sounds like a good approach to me. I think I need to give myself time and accept that things are changing (UGHHH I HATE CHANGE BUT FINE) and figure it out over time. Thank you, it really helped to read this."
"I did that, too, until I stopped drinking alcohol altogether because of medical reasons. Suddenly events became a lot more stressful, and I run out of social energy much sooner. I think it’s great that you are listening to yourself!"
"Same. But it will get better ... Or at least different. I cannot go back, but I am happier now"
"This sounds beautiful and sad at the same time (because it probably is). Thank you for sharing. I will try to just let my feelings happen, even though I definitely have a hard time figuring them out. Give me 3-5 business days and I may know what I feel. I'm also trans so I know a few things about self-acceptance, but man, I thought I was done with this. I guess life finds a way to still surprise you."
"Oh boy, that makes so much sense. I hate doing things that don't make sense to me, like, I-want-to-punch-a-wall-hate, and now that I know what masking is it really feels like having to do unneccessary math bullshit back in school.   


Thank you so much! I also get the lashing out part. I'm happy that to found some kind of balance (at least it sounds like that) and I hope I will get there, too, someday."
"This guy is literally just a writer/content creator with zero professional background in what he's discussing and the first minute is full of *so much* misinformation. 

He's discussing the concept of synaptic pruning. He claims that getting a diagnosis *causes* more synaptic pruning. 

This is nonsensical. The current data around the synaptic pruning hypothesis indicates that autistic brains would have less synaptic pruning, and indeed that autism itself may be directly interlinked with the brain's inability to cull out inefficient synpases and neurological connections.

It's also a straight-up lie to claim ""this has not been officially studied as it pertains to certain neurovariances"" (which is a made-up term with only 5.1k results on a Google search), ""because the research money goes into 'curing' neurodiversity instead of helping us"". This is profoundly anti-intellectual and it encourages people to trust a random on tiktok instead of scientific data.

He also refers to synpases as ""the nerves within neural networks"" which is just a wild misunderstanding of how the brain *works*. There are no nerves in your brain. Zero. You cannot ""feel"" your brain in that sense, because there are no nerves in it. There are *neurons*, which pass electrical signals to one another to make the engine of the brain actually function. He then links this concept to schema theory, which again has NOTHING to do with nerves or physical function in the body, but is instead a way to try to theoretically describe how brains gather and store knowledge in collected conceptual webs. 

There is no data to suggest that you literally lose synpatic concepts in your brain due to an altered perception of masking. It's just ... wildly misinformative and I cannot believe that it takes until 2.5 minutes in for this guy to admit all of this is his personal theory

I'm all for listening to people's lived experiences and looking for more data from personal accounts, but no one can provide a personal anecdote that would confirm synpatic pruning being directly involved in something like this because you cannot observe synaptic pruning yourself. You simply cannot. It has to be observed by looking at the physical structure of brain functioning. 

It's pseudoscientific and just trying to use smart words to sound more compelling"
"This was super helpful, thank you. I recently changed jobs and then discovered my likely autism a few weeks later. I’ve been floundering with feeling like I can’t perform at the same level at work, but I also realized my old job (of 15 years) was a super unhealthy dynamic. I just need to find my new optic fiber :)."
Happy that I could help by accident!
"Heck yeah, me too. I don't have t-rex hands (at least I haven't noticed yet), but I'm fidgeting all the time. I remember how I practised facial impressions in front of a mirror when I was a teenager. It's kind of amusing that I thought that everyone is doing that. But hey, now I'm monitoring my status quite closely when I'm in public and just go home when everything is starting to build up instead of pushing it done violently. Baby steps!"
Is your disability just for autism or do you have another condition?
"Thank you, I’m trying this! I'm trying to be more honest with myself and watch my needs more closely, and I’m slowly starting to unmask in front of my friends. Also I'm focused on one of my special interests (writing) and building myself a few new routines, so this helps a lot, too!"
"Finger's crossed for your diagnosis. I hope everything works out fine! I'm trying to get into diagnosis right now, but man, it's a nightmare. Even waiting lists are closed where I live. But hey, I've got time (at least I'm trying to tell myself that). I'm sorry that you are feeling like this as well, but I have to agree - thank you for sharing! It really helps to know you are not imagining things and that there are others who understand."
"Some days, I burn out fast and need breaks. Today, I randomly cried not bc of the bullying, but because it was so hard to mask what my body was doing.  I was so embarrassed, but I know at least I'm not suppressing it. Masking is safe, but it also leads to physical costs beyond what I imagined, so I'll keep taking it off if that means living longer. There are layers & levels to connection with people, so I'm still authentic. I'm just sometimes still wearing a partial mask. Maybe it's an eye patch somedays idk whatever gets me through the day, at least it's getting easier."

"Oh wow, what a journey. I'm happy that you got your diagnosis though. <3 Take care and thank you for sharing!"
Can I ask what accommodations you were able to find? I have a similar story
"I want to try this, but I’m worried I’m just going to trade the stress of masking for the stress of ostracism. Im worried about the long term health effects too, especially knowing there is an established correlation between mental health and average life span."
literally me when my psychologist asked me if I ever considered ASD
"I'm so glad it helped! You're definitely in the right place. A lot of posts on this sub that are like ""does anyone else..."" or ""how come I...?"" really helped with my impostor syndrome and my confusion following my own realization that I was autistic, and just how to navigate this totally new and transformative lens through which I could now view myself and my life.

I also found videos on YouTube by autistic women really helpful, because it was good to see other models that weren't white boys loving trains. I particularly like Mom on the Spectrum (not actually very focused on her experiences as a mother as much as just general autistic experience) and Yo Samdy Sam."
"I kind of think of it like when you're reorganizing your closet -- there's that point where you've pulled everything out, and you just have stuff piled everywhere on your bed and on the floor, and you're like ""oh god, what have I done, this is so much worse!"" 

But then you're able to keep the things that serve you, let go of the stuff you don't need anymore, and tidy everything away so you feel much calmer and ready to face getting dressed in the morning."
I relate to this SO much. I really struggled with this
Thank you for clarifying!
"Absolutely! Also, I think it's just common to feel stupid at a new job for like the first 6 weeks regardless of how long we've been doing something. New place, new people, new systems...I just know I'm going to feel like an idiot no matter what. 😅"
Also my stutter came back & I snort when I laugh now so I guess it has its entertainment too
Thank you! I wish you all the best seeking answers for yourself ❤️
"I saw a neuropsychologist who tested me for other conditions first (ADHD and PTSD) to rule out whether they could be the cause of my symptoms. I went through some CPT therapy specifically for PTSD with that same neuropsych, and neither my other diagnoses nor the therapy could rule out autism. When a psych is testing for ""rule outs,"" they are essentially following a section of the DSM that requires seeing if another diagnosis could account for my experiences. I found this pretty critical, since I learned how PTSD can closely mimic ADHD and/or autistic behaviors. 

My neuropsych was retiring but suggested a formal autism assessment. So I then ended up connecting with a clinical psychologist who could screen for autism. None of this was cheap, but it was not astronomically expensive the way I expected, e.g. my first two assessments were $750 combined 

I'm American, if it helps. It might be a good idea to search for any autism societies in your location for local resources to get started."
"I do have the advantage of a supportive partner and a kiddo with autism, so I have some safety there. Work is terrifying to do it with, and I’m probably still masking some, but I also started a new job so I am trying to present more myself. I haven’t run into any issues of people looking at me like I’m weird…yet"
"Yes I have been doing my head in trying to juggle whether I actively try and de-mask because I need to for health reasons, or should I hold off for 6 months to allow me to finish up some work and close an org I started.

I’m already experiencing skill regression so I just don’t know how bad it will get before it gets better

And yeah I’m one of the people who started getting more symptoms and traits showing up just from knowing I was autistic after dx. Very deep into burnout though"
"Oh boy! This made my moment! You totally understand! Currently in burn out, and relate to all of us! As I’m trying to correct whether or not, I should use the word all because I am a literal person, but not all the time because I’m fucking burn out. Really I don’t care, but it definitely helps to know there are other women out there that are just as confused or not confused as I am, but on the same page. I really don’t care so much about being a perfectionist right now. Lol."
"That's such a nice analogy, thanks for sharing!"
"I feel like I’m a liar, but not a nasty one, more of a misleading one. People often believe I am more similar to them or agree with them more than I do because I just act and go along with them. I feel like I have 10 different personalities each for everyone I meet. I fake laugh, I fake smile. I force myself to make conversation and ask questions. It mostly comes on at work or with acquaintances. Also if I truly unmasked I would take my squishmallow with me everywhere"
"I learned to mask as a kid for various reasons. I didn’t know that I was autistic but knew that people didn’t like when I spoke my truth. I also found all social “rules” so confusing. My dad definitely helped me learn to mask - he’d tell me he felt the same way about something but that my life will be easier if I learned how to respond in a way that people expect me to. 

I realized about a year ago that if im not alone in my room or with one specific friend - I’m masking. To me it feels like I’m playing in a movie but its difficult because no one really taught me the lines but gave me the general gist of the character. 

Unmasking feels great for the most part - like I can really be myself. I’ve been practicing unmasking more but it has made my strong sense of justice come out x10 that creates this intense anger that I haven’t figured out now to manage yet."
"I learned to mask when i was 18, but i didn't think of it that way. I thought of it like learning a language. I watched the mannerisms and speech patterns of my peers at college, and started implementing them. It was very successful, and i made friends. But i definitely have limits, and i don't know what tone of voice to use all the time, so if i have to mask and don't know what to do I'll just talk in a very flat tone, and if i don't have to mask i will whisper a lot. I didn't realize i whisper so much until someone pointed it out. I'd like to stop, actually."
"Masking is not showing people the person I am and whatever I am feeling. It is acting to ensure the other person is not put off by my strangeness. I have displayed anxiety in front of people in order to make themselves feel better, while not actually having anxiety. Or hidden my body discomfort in order to make others feel comfort. 

Masking is also never showing people just how much energy it takes to ensure I react properly to a situation. In a conversation? Don't talk too much. Don't laugh too hard. At a party? Don't run away. At a meeting for work? Make eye contact. 

My parents prefer a pretense and so every time I see them, I'm laughing and engaged. Which takes alot. And since my parents want to see me frequently, I am frequently completely burnt out. I take vacation days where I need to recover, tell my parents I'm having a busy day, and then spend the whole day just wiped out. My parents are a separate issue but still part of the masking."
"Been thinking about this allot lately, and I feel like I'm just starting to get the smallest understanding of it. The only thing I've determined so far is that there are times when I feel more myself and in those moments I feel like the mask is off. Then there are times when I act in a reactionary way that doesn't quite seem to make sense. I've only been unpacking the fact that I've been living with autism for about a year so I'm still trying to understand allot about myself."
"You know that joke entertainment does about people having a certain act if they're in customer service jobs? Like they're all smiles and affability while they're on the clock, but the SECOND they finish their shift their mask comes off and they look like they're dead inside? I'm like that to varying degrees, I built it up throughout my years of customer service on top of having to put a ""socially acceptable"" act for my family members (at this point it's just the path of least resistance and I don't see them that much either way, and even with my efforts I'm still considered the black sheep of the family even though we have *two literal criminals* as my uncles, wtf), and honestly it's a bit hard to let go of it, but I'll be honest it has served me well when it comes to job interviews in general, even the bad ones/the ones I don't get the job, I feel like I'm not their worst candidate overall.

I've ben trying to be more ""authentic"" when I'm meeting people that could potentially be new friends, but to be honest I'm not entirely sure what is authentic and what is my mask? I mean a lot of things I did work on because I didn't ""like"" parts of my personality or how I acted on certain feelings. I think at this point the mask is a permanent part of me, and I think it's OK to not unmask fully? I've seen many people comment that it can be just as hard to unmask, or to not know who you are under the mask."
"I'm 26 now, I was about 24 when I learned I was autistic. I've kind of always been masking I guess? Idk, since I'm late diagnosed there wasn't a point when I think I ""started"" masking. I think I spent my childhood and early adolescence trying to figure out what worked socially. I think I got pretty *good* at masking later in high school (honestly probably with the help of pretty privilege)

I can definitely speak more to masking as an adult, because it's more conscious now. My mask now adapts to the person, I think I do a lot of mirroring. I absolutely use pretty privilege to my advantage now. My mask is usually either pretty quiet weird girl, or flirty quirky disney channel best friend vibes.

Being pretty quiet weird girl is admittedly a much easier mask to maintain. She feels a lot more like the real me. Flirty quirky disney channel best friend takes a lot of energy out of me but is popular in the workplace, older women love her. That one is a lot of smiles, very active facial expressions, going with the bit, etc. 

Unmasking is pretty easy for me, I suspect I was a relatively low masking child, so it's pretty easy to drop it. I basically just have to drop my facial expressions and that gets me like, ""out of character."""

">It is easy to imagine that camouflaging demands significant cognitive effort, leading to mental exhaustion over time, and in extreme cases perhaps also contributing to anxiety and depression.

The social and intellectual Jujitsu needed to pass for somewhat ""normal"" is exhausting on a day-to-day basis, but I agree it also has a cumulative effect.  I don't have the energy to camouflage like I did when I was younger.  I find myself avoiding people a lot more so that I don't have to expend the energy, or just bothering less when I am around people."

"Glad there is a term for this. I just used to call it mimicking. It works most of the time for me.  Part of me also wonders if there could ever be a competition to find out who is the best at this and who has the most sophisticated camouflaging techniques. Like a kung fu master, but instead a mimic master! 

I also wonder if ultimately it is healthy to do. I mean, we have to survive amongst the NTs, but should we have to camouflage? Is it bad for us because of how exhausting it can be? Stress isn't healthy and it does shorten a person's life span. I live alone, and am 42. Being alone lets me recharge from work, which is highly social. I need my evenings to recharge to prepare to camouflage tomorrow. Which is why I kind of want to know if there are different levels of camouflage skills, because quite frankly, I think my camouflage kung fu would rate well against others."
"It's what my mother calls ""intellectual coping"" when it comes to why it hasn't been diagnosed on me yet. The reasoning behind it is that she thinks that I'm on such a high cognitive level that I'm able to deal with specific situation other Aspies fail in just because I'm ""smart"" enough, and also able to train my behaviour quick enough in order to not stand out so much.

Anecdotally, I have seen many self-professed high IQ Aspies on the Internet who discuss social problems I've never dealt with.  Or it's clear they have such a low level of self-awareness, they barely understand the concept of calibration.

And yet, they all were gifted, strong math skills, all that jazz.

"I got my diagnosis when I was on my mid-20s, and I believe my late diagnosis is because of my slightly above average IQ. I remember as a kid having to push extra hard to be on the same social level as other kids, but other than that I had no real troubles with the outside world. I didnt do very well in school, not even in the subjects I enjoyed. It was not because I couldn't learn, but because I just didn't care. Trying to pass as ""normie"" was very tiresome and I found myself pretty much daydreaming through all the classes.

Now that I'm older and aware of my issues, I know how to balance and prioritize my energy. I just wish I had been diagnosed earlier. My older brother also has asperger's and he got diagnosed as a kid, but I guess compared to him I look like a ""normie""."
"The word 'camouflage' doesn't seem quite appropriate  to me because my intent was never to deceive but to integrate. I was not hiding, I was trying to be like everybody else. In order to do this I ran emulations inside of my head which approximated the black box behavior I discerned from observing others, essentially duplicating with 'digital' functions that others did automatically.

When I hit about 50 I found that I no longer seemed to have the energy available to maintain these emulations. In addition my personal relationships went way outside the bounds that the emulations were supposed to run which caused additional breakdowns. At that point I realized what I had been doing my whole life and became thoroughly sickened by the deception. 

Now I find myself cast adrift because I can no longer live the lie I had been living, yet with no tools to live any other way. Such is the way of life, I guess."

"What's weird is that of my siblings, my sisters are neurotypical and my brothers are all on the Aspie scale, as am I.

But when I tell people I'm on the scale, trying to explain why I sometime avoid looking people in the eye when I'm tired, or just avoid people outright because it's exhausting to deal with them, they say stuff like, ""I know you identify as Aspie, but . . . "" meaning to me that even though they've only known me for a few years, they believe they understand me and know me better then I do.

It's an aggravating thing to hear.  I have been able to form connections between social behaviors and feelings within myself, but it's like they're going through a translator or, better yet, a transformer, stepping up or stepping  down the actual meaning inside my sphere of comprehension.

I believe that I am the best-socialized of the males in my biological family (I bounced around a lot of foster homes growing up), but even then, I do not feel love, do not feel valued in this world, and generally believe that I am simply not really *wanted* anywhere.  I don't mean people go out of their way to push me out the door, but rather that they find dealing with me taxing, as I do them.

"Some people are diagnosed with other things instead which is incorrect, like I was with ADD, ADHD and a few others. It was only after I got my Asperger's diagnosis that they found out I had other issues I had been hiding for years.

I slept really late on weekends and took naps way more than most people did.  Now, I no longer bother.  Now that I know that I was pretending all that time, I don't want to do it anymore. The thing is though, with being intelligent, people think that correlates to the severity of the Asperger's.  When you're able to present as somewhat a normal person, people refuse to accept that you suffer, or that you are even on the spectrum. The pretending only enables you to look different on the outside, but the internal stuff is just as disordered as if we couldn't pretend. "
"That's very interesting, and I think you just explained why, at 45, I've suddenly become an inept blob. I simply don't have the energy to morph myself into the shape expected by society. "

Maintaining this mask or ""zone"" for long periods is as you describe incredibly exhausting. 

I had to do it at my last job, but when i got home i was so drained. Like there was nothing left of me at all, just tiredness and sadness. Ended up with depression once again.

I have something of a high IQ. Everyone just assumed that was the reason I was a bit odd growing up and didn't look any further. It very much seems to have enabled me to pass in many situations.
"This is why most of us can pass for NT if people don't look into us too closely. I was *much* worse when I was a kid, because I didn't understand that people were different from me or that I had to conform in order to be socially successful. When I figured it out, I bought a book on body language and social etiquette and spend hours in front of the mirror practicing facial expressions.

Those skills made it possible to live a fairly normal life after all was said and done. But it's still just a mask. It's exhausting and I hate keeping up the charade. One of the primary reasons I became self employed so I didn't have to do that shit anymore at work."
"I think it is also a matter of being lucky in the sense that had you been born with a slightly lower sensitivity threshold, you probably wouldn't have coped that well, regardless of IQ. I also consider that even extreme sensitivity is potentially manageable, but it does take more effort and time."
This is what I think as well. I have really good critical thinking and problem solving skills so I more or less brute forced my way through social norms or something along those lines. Eventually got a job where I don't have to give a crap about that stuff. Much less stressed out as a result.

Often people with high IQ will have trouble communicating due to this. Communication becomes difficult once you have about a 30 point difference +/-. Add this to the communication difficulties some people with ASD experience and it really compounds the problem.

>The gifted IQ ""takes away autistic features"" to me, it's too redundant and simple to say that. Maybe in SOME cases.

It doesn't really take them away. It's simply more processing power to use so that you can juggle more things at once to let you hide them. Like following a conversation and thinking about how your face should look, and remembering the correct body language. Eventually that level of sustained effort can take a toll and it takes away from being able to accomplish other things in your life."
This seems to be really common from what I've read here. People hit their 40s or 50s and just can't do it anymore or don't want to.

">Some people are diagnosed with other things instead which is incorrect, like I was with ADD, ADHD and a few others. 

I was originally diagnosed with ADHD(I) and dysthymia. Both *were* correct diagnoses in my case, however it was incomplete. I suspect that this happens to more than a few people with ASD."
"Not necessarily. Down that road lies the bad days of Applied Behaviour Therapy. I think a mix of learning to pass and learning when not to pass and how to manage the symptoms and mitigate the effects would be more important. There isn't really a one size fits all solution that would work for everyone, and it really has to be based on the needs of the individual at that stage in their life. 

When I was in high school passing would have been what I was most interested in. In university I had some executive function and depression problems. As an older adult I am dealing with workplace conflict and burn out and I am less concerned about passing outside of work. So people's needs and desires will change over time."
"> When you're able to present as somewhat a normal person, people refuse to accept that you suffer, or that you are even on the spectrum.

I've told very few people that I have ASD. Of the people I've told a teacher specializing in special ed said that if you can't see it then it doesn't affect you, a doctor said he didn't believe it and my boss told me I was obviously misdiagnosed. 3 of the 4 people (other than family) that I told essentially thought I wasn't or that it was so mild as to be insignificant. I would imagine this is a relatively common experience for people who pass.

"> Having to pretend to be ""normal"" at work takes every last bit of my strength.

this resonates with me too. several features of my job allow me to minimize personal interaction with both the public and coworkers. my supervisor sometimes checks in after a few weeks pass without personally visiting each other. without those features of my job, I wouldn't know how to survive. 

I wore the NT mask, or at least attempted to, for much of school and my early career. now that I've established myself a little, it's nice to let the mask slip a little. to earn and maintain a reputation based on merit and problem-solving ability instead of personality seems a much better strategy for us aspies. a social gaffe might shatter a social-based reputation in a moment, and we run a higher risk of that type of accident. on the other hand, we seem to play a better and more skillful game when handling concrete, non-personal tasks. these seem to make a more stable core and sturdier base to stand on.

Fine certain things like knowing why someone is sad doesn't come through with AS but learning tell tale signs that someone is sad and then learning to be kind or respectful to someone showing those signs is absolutely something that is taught. 

I might only be 80 or 90 percent accurate when diagnosing sadness but it's enough such that people generally think I care about sad people. On the other hand I know many NTs do not deal with sad people well. I think the social skills of your parents or environment are picked up on just as much for ASD as NT.

"I was originally diagnosed with ADHD myself. The psychologist was very equivocal about it and thought there was something else going on that he couldn't quite put his finger on. Though at the time I was happy with that diagnosis. I think my IQ and the ADHD really did make it hard to see the ASD if he wasn't specifically looking for it.

Masking didn’t make me more likable so I might as well just be myself :) I’m not a horrible or awful person, I just don’t know how to engage or socialise with others, I never will.

But now that I have children and a lot more time alone and with comforting people. Talking to my kids I find it the most often I revert to my normal voice and sometimes I think I sound like a man lol. 

I’ve been reassured that is not the case. But that’s one of the most obvious feelings of masking with t he most obvious evidence of it from my perspective. 

Another thing is just generally ignoring my own social needs to make sure the people around me aren’t uncomfortable. 

It’s hard to put masking into words for me right now lol. But hopefully that makes sense?"
"Hiding sensory issues, for example, to look ""normal"" and flexible and not be weird. Until recently I did it so well I wasn't really aware of them. I was just exhausted and irritable and had angry outbursts over minor things, but like nobody knew, hiding anger or any emotion I'm not sure I should show is part of it.

My neighbor told me I don't talk to them... yeah, I see no reason and also, when I'm in my home mode, I am not mentally prepared to talk to people. Which is funny that I have to be prepared. It never occured to me, but it's like outside clothes. They come off, the mask comes off, and when I meet someone while walking a dog or something, I'm shocked someone speaks to me and can't react normally and hold eye contact, even though I do it all the time at work.

I mean, I'm still learning about who I am and what I do and it's enlightening. I've never thought I was doing so many things just to appear normal."

"I honestly didn't know I was doing it until my psychiatrist diagnosed me and explained that masking and burnout were what was causing a lot of my mental health problems.  I went through a few stressful things and tried to start a new job but I physically couldn't leave the house without crying/having a panic attack.  He explained that I'm so burnt out I can't mask my true emotions/self in public anymore.  So I guess I found out I did it when I lost my mask?

ETA: Then I started noticing how I used to mask, it apparently isn't normal to be analysing how you're standing, the number of seconds you're looking into someone's eyes, how much space you're taking up, what you should do with your hands, how to stim (which I didn't know was doing) discreetly, etc, all while pulling apart every word said by others, trying to formulate the most appropriate reply and just keep up with the conversation in general."
"When I used to look up “how to make friends” “how to be popular” “why does no one like me” why does no one want to be my friend” in elementary school. I made a conscious effort to pretend to like things the popular kids liked, to no avail. I think I was too weird even when I tried to not seem autistic. After I realized no one would like me whether or not I pretended to be something I’m not, i just refused to mask from that point on since it did nothing for me."
"Being obsessed with researching the psychology being my anxiety and trying to heal my childhood traumas basically led me to understand that I was masking. Moving out of my parents house and living with other people was part of it, I found myself constantly exhausted and would barely feel comfortable being myself in my own room alone. I always felt that I had to downplay myself before understanding the dynamic around me or when meeting someone new and then I would figure out how to act around them."
"The amount of people using adjectives for my personality that I didn't feel internally. Every time I'm called bubbly or laidback I get confused. 

Also, I can generally tell which coworkers I've had actual  discussions with based on their feedback about my ""personality."" (Friends I work with versus coworkers I'm polite with)."

"During peak COVID, I started talking out loud to myself while wearing a mask in public. It made me feel so much better so now I just chat away to myself whenever and wherever, and it's so much better"
"when i was 14 i had a full blown identity crisis because i couldn’t stop forcing myself to be happy and sociable at school. i just realized recently that that was masking. in other ways, i cant force myself to mask. i cant stop myself from rocking back and forth in public and making little noises. i get embarrassed and i’ll freeze up and try to act normal."
"When I learned copying other people’s clothes could Be considered masking. I was like, oh, then yeah. Also having to rehearse my intonations on social media videos I make versus just my reading, which sounds flat."
"My dad used to tell me I looked stupid and embarrassed him and I needed to stop doing certain things in public or he wouldn’t take me places anymore. So I tailored my behaviors to be like everyone else. I totally thought this was just what everyone did, and how everyone molded themselves. I thought everyone just woke up and like, thought about how to make themselves look and act like everyone else. I didn’t realize this was weird until like, a couple years ago. And it was just from like, someone posting about being autistic. I’m 27 and I’m slowly trying to undo what I’ve done? I’m trying to figure out what parts of me I actually like and what parts I created for others."
When I realized that not everyone spends every waking moment practicing potential conversations and interactions in their heads!
"in 6th to 7th grade I desperately tried to fit in and be cool, like the popular kids. I bought clothes I thought were trendy, but they never seemed to actually be. then one day in 8th grade I had enough and cut my hair and only wore boys clothing, because I hadn't had the energy to try anymore, so I deliberately made me not caring anymore (looking back, it is a mix of masking, gender dysphoria (I'm agender) and depression)

the other thing is this: my granddad and my mom died the same year of cancer. and of course that's terrible, but I never really actually grieved and I always felt so bad that I didn't miss them. it wasn't until recently that I learned it's object permanence, so I always pretended to be sad and miss them, but I always felt like I'm an imposter.

also, whenever I talked to someone about loving their family. I never got it. but when I said so, everyone's so weirded out that I started saying ""yes of course I love my family"", when I really didn't know if I do. sure I like my family and my dad and siblings are part of me. but how can I say I love them if we're only together by chance? I don't know if I'd be friends with them if they weren't my family, so how should I know if I love them?"
"I knew that I very much preferred to be at home alone. I told that to people a lot and they kept asking me why and I didn’t really have an answer for a while, so I spent time thinking about it. This was before I was diagnosed. And my first realization was that I was my most comfortable at home. I can wear what makes me feels the most comfortable, do exactly what I want without worrying about anyone else, I have everything I need right there, and not have to talk or interact with anyone else. I was curious about that last thing because I knew that a lot of other people like to socialize with others. So I guess from there I realized that any social interaction for me is a) uncomfortable/annoying and b) acting to please the other person. I am perfectly happy being alone, I relish it. A lot of of people dread being alone. When I made those connections, I realized I do mask at least a little around others."
"I mainly knew when I was doing it poorly. You ever try to politely laugh at someone's (not that funny) joke, only you can hear how unconvincing it sounds as you do it? I got that feeling starting around high school."
"It’s been an ongoing realization but for me it was something like, “what would you be doing if you were completely alone right now? Are you doing precisely that? No? Then you’re masking.”

It’s not a perfect rubric but it’s cleared up a lot of it for me."
"i remember when i was in high school i was nervous about starting college, partly because i'd have to say goodbye to my friends. people tried to make me feel better by telling me that college had lots of chances to make new friends. i tried to explain to them that i didn't necessarily like this,  i said something like, ""you know, when you meet brand-new people you have to be really careful about what you say and how you act? like when you meet someone new you have to be extra careful of when to speak, and you have to remember not to say things that might be off-putting or annoying, and smile and be really friendly?"" they didnt understand"
"I realized my best friends barely know me. The most ""me"" they see is when my husband is around. Months later I learned that's because I didn't unmask around them but I DO unmask with my husband, so some of that comes out whenever he's around, even if we're with others."
TikTok videos from autistic folks talking about their experiences and identifying with them.  At first it just seemed like a coincidence but now I’m starting to wonder if it’s more than that.
When I told my therapist I felt like a fake. Someone who acts.

"The first year of the pandemic, I worked from home as a university professor. I realized then how exhausted I had been and how much masking I had been doing. It’s still a bad habit, though, and something that will take a long time to truly resolve."
"For many many years I thought it was normal to act different and force yourself to present a certain way in public. My parents were big on manners and being presentable so it was drilled in my head what was expected of me socially so I had a good understanding of how to navigate most situations. I didn't know I was masking until pretty recently when I learned more about the term and reflected on it.

The only way I can explain it is there is a personality I have in social situations involving people I don't know and there is a personality I have that is shown to my closest circle. And those two personalities are wildly different. At home I don't make any eye contact, I don't make as many facial expressions, I don't force myself to laugh at things that aren't funny, I don't need a fidget, I don't feel as perceived, etc. It's just a huge weight off my shoulders and it doesn't take near as much energy to socially interact."
"This might not help because I'm not diagnosed etc. but when I first read about masking and didn't think I was autistic I thought ""welcome to the concept of socialising, I guess?"" LMAO. 

I guess I only truly feel able to fully relax and be my absolute self when I'm alone (or think I'm alone). I love being with friends etc but I have always felt that when I'm at work I'm at work, when I'm at home with others/in a shared living space I'm at work, and with friends and/or fam, guess what, I'm at work. Different types and varying enjoyablities of work, but still work, just in terms of being polite. 

I would contrast this with various people I've lived with (mostly men tbh) who seem to think they can ignore housework or just say whatever, do whatever, even if it's really rude/ unsupportive in social situations. I used to think it was purely a thing with gender and child-rearing, now I think I've been surrounded by undiagnosed autistics my whole life! 🤣 And that certain people weren't masking as heavily at home as they did/do at work or with people they didn't/ don't know as well. 

I'm intrigued to see if people here relate or I'm talking total BS!"
"I recently got the official diagnosis. Before that I thought I couldn't be autistic because I could handle social interaction usually, and did not recognize autistic people's accounts of masking.

For me, I don't have to think about it at all, it does go automatically. But I constantly have acreeping feeling that no one around me actually knows me. When people talk about me, it feels to me like they are talking about some stranger I don't know. There is a big gap between my experience of myself, and other people's experience of me."
"For me, it was my diagnosis, which came at a complete surprise. Afterward, I've felt far more comfortable dropping the mask and letting people just deal with it. Though, I mostly appear unfriendly, serious, or stoic at best. 
My diagnosis has helped me take care of myself and respond to my needs."
"When I cant maintain it flawlessly, when it falls off anytime I have to stand up for myself."
"OOF. 

I’ve always said; “me at school isn’t me, me at work isn’t me, hell me with friends isn’t me, the second people get to know the REAL me they almost always leave” my bf and BFF since childhood are the two literal only exceptions in my 24yrs of life."
Wait a second … I’ve had that same exact thought .. damn
"... It's eerie how similar my circumstances are to yours. This really hit me! I did social work for a good while for the same reasons you described, and have only just left that horrible, horrible industry (not that the work isn't important or good!! Just an awful match for me as an autistic person recovering from prior abuse). The combo of autism and CPTSD makes it so challenging, day-in and day-out. Wishing you the best!"
"Relate to this very much. I’m 45 and new to this diagnosis so I never experienced ABA and instead was marked as gifted but I have constantly tried to train myself into what I thought was what I “ought” to do, and endured so much mistreatment from others, but especially from myself"
I relate to this very much.
This comment really helped me put some things together about my own motives - thanks. I hope you've found the kinda life that suits you best.
Same! I just thought that was what everyone does...
"Also overthinking what I had said to people. Was that too rude? Was it too blunt? Did I talk enough? Did I talk too much? Do I need to change what I did the next time this comes up?

I also thought everyone else did that."

"I can easily take on the quirks of other people’s language. I do it for days after being around someone with an unusual language ‘tick’, even if I don’t actually like the ‘tick’. I just have to like the person."
I FEEL this comment to the depths of my soul!!!!! My God! I constantly 'downplay/dumb down' hypervigilent to suppress myself in case of rejection etc I always wonder how people can just be so free and themselves in any situation😭
I thought everyone did it too! I’m honestly still shocked that people just casually have conversations without doing that
Omg yes. Also “Why did people react that way?” And me endlessly trying to find out what I said wrong 🤦🏾‍♀️
Yeah I’ve just not gone to events before because I feel so uncertain about how the interactions will go

"If you're unsure, you're masking. It's like dreaming: you can't tell when you're dreaming because it's your only reality. But when you wake up you know which is which. Masking is an enormous effort. You can't keep it up forever. Be ready to fall apart. Then you'll know who you really are.

Interactions with autistic people who aren't masking have helped me a lot. In fact, I recently discovered a new autistic role model: the singer from the band [Soda Fountain Rag](https://www.sodafountainrag.no).

Sometimes at Autscape (a conference run by and for autistic people in the UK) I encounter these autistic people without their mask, and I fall in love. I see ""this person is my real self"" and then I know how to not mask.

This is the problem: we live in a world where all our role models (i.e. everyone we might learn from) are either NT or pretending to be NT. To find an autistic person being themself we have to find a place where autistic people feel safe, among their own kind."
"I was diagnosed a year ago at 23, and since then I’ve found I’m masking most in ‘negative’ situations where I would not react in the ‘appropriate’ (preferred) physically emotional way, as opposed to happy emotions where many more ways of expressing are socially accepted. When someone tells me about painful or hard experiences, I do feel a lot of empathy, but I do not automatically show this in my body language. This is when I’ve always felt the uncomfortable need to mask (semi-consciously), and I still remind myself to do this so the other person can see my empathy. 
It also works the other way around: when I’m trying to explain to someone how I feel, I will mask so they can recognise my emotions. 

When dealing with neurotypical people, I draw a pretty clear line now since I got my diagnosis: whom is this situation about emotionally? Am I there to comfort this person? Then I will mask. Is this person there to comfort me? Then I will not mask, because masking makes me more uncomfortable, and if the other person doesn’t understand my feelings/expression and will not comfort me as a result, they’re making the situation about them. It should not always be the one person’s job to conform to the other person’s way of showing emotion. 

I felt so free to be me when I met another autistic person who had a big smile on their face when talking about something horrible, because the theory and science behind it was so interesting to them and I asked them to share their knowledge. "
I had a burnout about 20 years ago and the mask fell off.  My symptoms have gotten worse after a medical issue that leaves me unable to take medication.  I don’t think I can mask now even if I try. I feel like everyone I meet is onto me and there’s no use pretending. 
"The best way I've found to recognize when I'm masking is to identify when I'm *not* masking, which is at home in my comfort zone. Then I just compare those observations to when I'm out and it becomes very clear that I'm masking, because it's such a contrast. I still mask every day, mostly for work and it's leading to a major burnout. "
"To be honest, I'm not sure myself. I definitely feel more natural when I'm talking about something I really care about, like I can just freely express my thoughts and my thoughts just fly out of my mouth and turn into sounds, or something.

I guess it's masking when I feel more of an explicit *disconnect* between the words and my thoughts. Like there's this barrier between what I want to say, and I'm projecting a persona outwards, or something, and it feels choppy and not fluid."
"For me the process of figuring out the real me was kind of a slow thing. It took about 5 years to totally drop it. All my life I had a lot of anxiety around people, and an intense feeling of being ""other"" no matter how hard I tried. All of my actions were very performative; as in, I was basing my life on how I thought I should act based on observing others-and it was exhausting. 

Its difficult, but stop worrying about what other people think as much as possible. Let yourself act and react in ways that come naturally to you. It does take a heavy dose of not giving a fuck to achieve this lol, so it can be difficult. Know your own limits and dont push yourself too far just for the benefit of others. Ive also found it helps me to be up front with people about my autism and any part of a situation I struggle with. (Like if we were in someplace too crowded and it was making me panic, I would just tell them and leave. The old me would have tried to grin and bear it.)

If you live authentically maybe everyone wont like you, but a lot of people do respect that. I personally have made better friends without the mask that I did with it. I hope that you have some supportive people around you and that you are able to feel better :)

"
"That's my secret.

I'm always masking."
"Really. It is just when social interaction is something you really think about and try to do the same as someone else.

I've never been able to really do it though. But if ya are, ya know"
"Haha, yeah, I have the same 3 personas. Me, funny girl, and quiet weirdo. "
omg sameeee (lol finding this thread 3 years later)
Spot on tge 3 personas I have thank you very much!
"I’m currently in the process of a diagnosis and idk if I’m the only one but does anyone brain try to trick them into believing you’re faking it because you’ve mask for so long, you’re not used to it.. maybe it’s just me idk 

But I 100% understand what you mean about the 3 personalities and I’m exactly like that just minus the at home one as I still need to mask :’) anyway, you’re not alone <3"
">Interactions with autistic people who aren't masking have helped me a lot. 

I only know one autistic person in real life (that I know of). I do feel like I can be myself around him to some extent. But at the same time, we've had a couple of arguments that ended with him shutting down and me melting down, and that was...idk, just awkward and terrible. So now I feel like I have to mask even with him bc I don't want that to happen again.

It's really fucking frustrating sometimes. I have no idea who I am anymore. Or I guess I never did, but it seemed easier when I thought I did."
"> When someone tells me about painful or hard experiences, I do feel a lot of empathy, but I do not automatically show this in my body language. 

Ugh, this is the worst. I literally do not know what to say or how to act when people tell me hard things. It's so awkward, and I guess I say the ""right"" things, but I really hate it.

>I felt so free to be me when I met another autistic person who had a big smile on their face when talking about something horrible.

Haha, this is one time when my work is useful. I'm a nursing assistant, and nurses/aides are always talking about terrible and gross things, but totally casually. I am really fascinated by bodies, injuries, illnesses, etc. The gorier, the better. The downside is having to interact with a lot of patients & their families, which can be hard sometimes. But I think my ability to be detached and pragmatic helps me a lot, in general."
"Can I ask how old you are? I'm only 27, but I think this happened to me too after a few really bad burnouts in my early 20s. My symptoms got a lot worse in a short time and socializing is so much harder than it used to be. I'm kind of scared I'll never be able to ""blend in"" again.

I hate feeling like everyone I meet sees right through me. I miss being able to just put on a face and having people like that person. Now it seems like people dislike me by default."
">I feel like everyone I meet is onto me and there’s no use pretending. 

I can't decide if this sounds amazing or terrible..."
This is smart. But I'm honestly not always sure. The only time I know I'm not masking is when I'm completely alone.
"I understand this feeling very well! If I get into that flow I feel like I'm being 100% myself and nothing's getting in my way because I'm so engaged. Thoughts-words-sounds connected, coming out freely/naturally as you said. Thanks for working this as you did!"
">Its difficult, but stop worrying about what other people think as much as possible. Let yourself act and react in ways that come naturally to you.

I really like this; thank you. A lot of people don't like me even when I am masking - apparently I'm not very good at it, idk. So I don't care too much what people think anymore.

I am moving to a new city next summer and will only know a handful of people. I'm looking at that as my starting over, when I can be more open about it and hopefully figure out a better life for myself. I do love the idea of being able to be somewhat open about things..."

The Twitter #ActuallyAutistic community has been huge for me. I realized I was autistic by reading a discussion thread I had stumbled on.
"It *is* awkward!! Do you do that thing where you shift in your seat, trying to find the right posture too? In the end I find the right words to say (most of the time), but it takes all of my energy. This is why it bothers me when neurotypical people think autistic people don't have empathy. You need a LOT of it to know which 'mask' you need in any situation.

That's a really interesting career you chose. How do you deal with patients and their families' emotional needs? Is this something you had to learn; do you share any difficulties you might have with it with your colleagues?

Growing up, I was my mother's emotional caretaker much more than she was mine. Only recently I've dropped my mask when communicating with her. She has a lot of experience working with autistic people with intellectual disabilities, who could not mask, but still I would always scare her when my (then undiscovered) autism 'came out' and I was too pragmatic for her to understand me. I was labeled with ""doesn't know how to feel emotions"". Now I no longer apologise for my way of feeling and showing emotions in my family, and finally our relationship is starting to feel more like a mother/daughter relationship in which I am the daughter and she is the mother... (:"
"Early 40s but I learned to be comfortable in my own skin before I actually knew why I was different. I’m a loner and I don’t really build the deep friendships that others have, I just don’t see a need for it and I hate going outside my comfort zone. I have people I socialize with in a superficial level and I’m pretty open about having ADHD but not that I’m an aspie, only a couple of people know that. I know some people think I’m weird or snobby (resting bitch face all the time) but the ones that were able to see past that are the ones I call friends. I know it’s a cliche but just be yourself & embrace who you are, there is nothing wrong with us, our brains just work differently. The hiding just makes everything worse. Find people that accept you for who you are. Also, not sure if this is true for everyone but I find that I can relate better to relatives/parents of autistic people. One of my longest friendships is to someone who had an autistic nephew when we met and now her oldest is on the spectrum.  "
"I know this wasn't for me, but I'm 35. I've had a few burnouts before, although I didn't realize what they were. And I think I'm in the middle of one now.

My response to previous burnouts has been to mask more and try harder to be normal. I'm starting to realize that I only made things worse by doing that, and set myself up for the next one. So now that I know what's been going on all this time, I really want to understand it, and myself, so I can hopefully avoid another one.

I have a lot of major life changes coming up in the next year, and there is no way I'll make it through unless I figure this all out."
I feel the same Recently mad burn out. Lack of support circle and just a bad downward circle. .
I'm right there with you.
"Thanks for the advice. I'm kind of in a similar position with the friends I have now, and while I guess I'm content I still feel like I *should* have closer friendships? I lost a good group of people during one of my bigger burnouts and ever since then I've felt lonely. But I also don't emotionally connect with or particularly care about people? Ugh that sounds so awful but it's true.

I guess I need to work on my self acceptance more. Your perspective helps! \^_\^"
"Same, I always dug my heels in deeper the more overwhelmed I felt. I realize now it really didn't help anything.

I hope things go really well for you! Maybe you could meet with a therapist and work on some healthier coping mechanisms? That's what I'm planning on doing. I'm almost done with school and slightly panicking about what comes after. 😬

I'm sure you'll do great though. You know what doesn't work, so just trust your own judgment and don't overburden yourself! You can do it."
"I actually just started seeing a therapist (again), and that is definitely something I want to work on."
"That's a really good first step to becoming more comfortable as the real you. I need to hurry up and find a therapist, too. It's so hard moving away from masking as a go-to solution to, like, every situation."
I hate this
this has happened to me more times than I can even count to the point where teachers didn’t allow people to talk to me
Thanks for unlocking my past traumatic memories
This makes me want to commit several crimes
"This used to happen to me on the daily. I am an earnest believer in rehabilitation and the ability for one to repent their past transgressions, but anyone who has done this needs their ankles cabled to the frame of a car and drug along the road at a slow speed."
I'm not autistic I'm just a stupid af introvert
It’s annoying because how do you even explain to teachers that it’s bullying
i want to die
What makes this worse is that they’re friends with the people that bully you
💀
I’m not on the spectrum but I had this happen to me so much in high school
"MAN, people used to do this shit with me and i HATED IT with a fire-y passion of a 1000 burning suns.

like if you wanna talk, talk. don't stand there like a halfwit mouth agape."
Fuck you op I finnaly managed to forget about this shit
Oh so that’s what they were doing
MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP AAHHHHH
real
This happened to me in high school and when I was asked “why don’t you talk to us?” I just replied “because I don’t like you guys” and that made them leave pretty fast
"I never had this happen to me in school, but this video makes it feel like I have and it makes me want to become wanted in 164 different countries for several crimes against humanity"
tf sad to see 80% girls are like this
Leave me be thot
"This happens to me because I sound different. Everybody at my school treats me like a heaping pile of shit because my voice is 2 octaves deeper than that of all the regular people there. Whenever I answer any sort of question, mumble any sort of jumble of words, hell, even if I say “here” when the teacher is taking attendance, I will always hear laughter coming from around me."
I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them.

"When I had an encounter like this for the first time, I thought they were actually being nice like the movies. Remembering shit I buried 6ft and about to have a panic attack (not actually)"
This makes me want to bite off someone's fingers
WHY. SO. ACCURATE.
i like panic at the disco 😭
"As someone who has ADHD, asbergers, and on the spectrum, high functioning, this happens a lot."
this shit is relatable. and now i feel even worse because of the name of the subreddit
"thx for the reminder, i often forget my place in life."
"I had something like this in my 9th grade biology class, this guy would tease me while I tried working. I knew nobody in the class except for my friend who sat next to me. He would usually talk about how I wore the Samy style shirts every day, he would join in conversations making it awkward, and (just like the video) he told me that his female friend liked me. This went on for the whole school year."
Been that kid. Now I have trust issues
"this happened to me a few times, just don't talk to them, talk to everyone but them

act like they don't exist"
"Damn, like it was yesterday. People are mean."
The anger I feel watching this...
What would be a great response to people who do this shit?
Fuck OP i had the same experience as a 'tism man.
"This hit me so hard. One of the hardest of posts on here.

This exact thing happened to me in middle school after I had just transferred to the school. I (23M, then 13) grew up in rural Pennsylvania and had just moved to suburban New Jersey, and it was a culture shock for me. I was quiet and introverted as is, and this girl in my class (who looks a lot like the OP) did this to me in gym. Telling me she thought I was cute and all that. I ignored her, because I knew better, and she was like ""why are you ignoring me? Don't you think I'm pretty?"" And all that.

Yeah, public school is great.

Edit: There was also a girl who full on fondled me in math class and my teacher ignored me."
i’m homeschooled and even i want to die
All the other kids with em pumped up kicks...
My temper is telling me to slam her head on the table
"I kinda enjoy this, not for the intention but her emotion she shows, and it would amuse me if someone did this to me"
I now realise that a pair of my closest friends only started talking to me as a joke DD:
"Bro just unlocked a fucking different level of trauma bro, happened to me and they basically just used me as a fall back when shit went sideways or when they wanted shit…"
I think 15 minutes of water boarding is better than being talked to like this for 15 minutes
They always thought you were too stupid to know what was going on but really what it was was you didn't want to be mean to them so you just continued responding and hoped they'd stop (this didn't work)
It’s the constant looking back at their friends that really gets me because it shows that they are “talking” to you to show off to their friends and they aren’t at all focused so it’s not really a conversation
This shit really hit home lol. Damn. Cruel people are very unoriginal.
"The worst part about this whole thing isn't how cringe it is, it's that I've had this exact same interaction so many times, almost the exact same questions and comments too."
"# JUST A FRIENDLY REMINDER TO PEOPLE THAT QUIET PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T WANT STRANGERS TO INTERACT WITH THEM. WE ARE QUIET FOR A REASON. NONE OF US ARE WAITING AND HOPING FOR SOMEONE TO TALK TO US. PLEASE LEAVE US ALONE

also please don't bother us to get a laugh with your ""friends,"" it will genuinely put us in a bad mood for the rest of the month"
"Sound like she has experience in this, being the quiet kid"
"Too real, man. I had people who asked me questions and talk behind my back."
I’ve had these moments and idk if I am autistic
"i fucking hate it when people do this shit

like damn, bitch, I don't even know you, gtfo of my face 💀"
Used to happen to me at school. At one point I had enough and I told them to fuck off and leave me alone.
"As a guy who at school made it a point to be genuinely friendly with people who were ""quiet"" this kinda behaviour always just made me sad"
I didn’t get anything like this from the popular kids. INSTEAD while I was sitting alone at lunch I had teachers come up to me and awkwardly try and start conversations
"damn bro, this has got to be one of the most relatable things I have seen on reddit. The person acting has done a really good job, and I hate it"
god this is painfully relateable as someone who is still in hs
going through this rn. I fucking hate it
Spot on
I’ve seen this happen before and this is so accurate. Pisses me off so much
I hate to admit I was the quiet kid in Highschool. Had a girl do exactly this to me and I straight up told her to fuck off and I hated her and her stupid friends. Nowadays I’m much nicer and a better person but I kinda miss having the ability to stick up for myself
It would be easier to stomach someone simply being mean/insulting instead of this snake behavior. I watch this and just feel so much pain for my 8th grade self. I was so oblivious that when asked what I was reading I responded “it’s really good and you can read it after me if you want.”
"in school for me I can’t tell if someone talking to me is actually genuine or just trying to fuck with me, so then I defaulted to not responding to anyone. Really messed up my social skills, and now I only really got the friends I made in like grade school. Fuck these people, dude."
"I'm not autistic, I just don't like to waste time with superficial and basic people"
Yup ive had people talk to me like that
"""do you not like us or something?""

""Yes."""
"This is a daily fucking occurrence, I’ve just gotten out of middle school and it was already a horrible and monotonous thing and I just don’t want to fucking deal with it anymore and I just know it’s going to be even worse in Highschool and There’s nothing I can do about it"
Nah this too real
Intrusive thoughts slowly manifesting in my brain at an early age for no particular reason at all
I am legitimately impressed someone managed to perfectly capture the essence of this because holy shit I cannot even count the number of times this exact thing has happened to me and it is a bittersweet feeling knowing people have gone through the same thing because it sucks ass 💀
This gives me PTSD of back when I was in school. Jesus.
I'm gonna kill myself just to spite this person
Fuck this fired up some old memories I hadn’t accessed for a while :(
well this brought up some repressed memories
Ow. This uh... this hit a little too close to home for me
"This is why it’s been so hard for me to make friends as an adult, everything feels like a setup now"
Makes me want to commit war crimes
These girls were cutting by the end of highschool
"I’ve never been much of a talker growing up, this was my middle school/early high school experience"
This. Exactly this.
The pound of C4
thats why they always have 1 hand in the backpack iykwim
"I fucking hate that valley girl voice, jfc."
Fck this brings back memories...people did this to me all the time.
the movement of those hands make me so fucking mad
"Ima need this to stop calling me out, please and thank you."
This mentally scarred me
I’m on the spectrum and I related way to much to this.
This is so accurate (I have experienced this)
"Seen a lot of shit on Reddit. Even fucked up shit on live leak.

Out of all the crap I've seen, I found this video one of the most difficult to watch."
My middle school experience summed up in a video.
The relatability is so painful it hurts... Badly.
This condescending tone. I heard it many times before and it still pisses me off. I'm autistic and whenever people talked to me when I was younger I heard this tone.
saddest shit ever
😠😤🔪
"i want to stab her, she annoys me so hard"
This hit close to home 😭 like Yes I don’t like y’all now fuck off will ya
"As autism, very real. I'm pretty sure my friends talk to me as a last resort"
"""By the way ,what's your name again "" almost always saves it."
This girl really nails this.. like way too well.
"I remember this happening to me on the bus, asking me what I was doing on my phone snickering and all, I just responded curtly and kept on the gacha grind, gave up by the time we reached the school street"
"My son has autism, and I'm afraid of stuff like this happening to him when he gets to high school, but also I'll fight a teenager if they pick on my boy 👊🏽👊🏽"
And then they call you “bestie”
I feel like I just had a flashback

I- I can’t believe I thought this was normal for 14 years of my life
The worst part is I thought they were actually being nice to me. You really have to learn things the hard way if you have autism.
"This happened to me a few times and it was one of the humiliating parts of life, anyone who does can fuck themselves"
Bro she’s literally alone in her room 😭
Imagine thinking you're being cool by doing this and when you die the devil laughs and talks to you like this eternally while torturing you
people who talk like that need to be drug out into the streets and shot. I've had stuff like this happen to me a couple of times and I can't stand these morons
"As an autistic person, I can confirm. Pure sadness."
This girl abuses the goth kids.
"I despise these people. They establish a social system and it requires people like them to like you, if you want to be accepted. Suddenly, they have the nerve to approach me, and make jokes like this, and treat me like an idiot."
I once got Paired by someone like that but in the end it didn’t really bother me after all it was just for a project after all
"i hated this, like why go through the effort of tormenting a person and manipulating them into a false sense of security just to mock them?"
"Man I was quiet once. It'd about the right people. Sometimes you find them and they find you, just make sure you know the difference between right and wrong people."
"I find it very hard to tell when people are being sarcastic, this lady included"
Is this why American kids are shooting their school?
This happened to me. I’m not autistic. I was just a teenage girl and kids love to bully those. Even adults have you seen how adult men say horrible things about teenage girls and make fun of them and dismiss them? Yeah it’s brutal to be a teenage girl
This generation is f’cked.

"Being slightly autistic myself, i fucking hate it when this happens. Also, when my friends expect me to know if theyre joking or not when i have made it perfectly clear that i dont understand social cues"

She has zero self esteem and demeans others for TikTok clout - she’s a 0.0 ……
A Quiet kid atleast should have the mouth to say Fuck off
"I dont think anything she said is even that bad? Guys I think they were actually just trying to talk to you, atleast most of the time. What makes you think they have bad intentions? Not everyone's just a peice of shit off the bat lol"
"This happened to me once. The secret to getting out of it is saying super weird stuff and then nobody talks to you again. For example:

“OMG what are you reading?”

“Crime-scene photos.”

“Oh…why are you reading that?”

“Inspiration and pleasure.” (Stare menacingly) “You have nice skin.”

(Quick steps away from me)

I go back to reading whatever true-crime book I was reading.

Gotta love weaponized creepiness. Plus, sometimes you find a willing accomplice."
I don't see the problem
"I legit would almost punch someone like that, that's happened so many times and I almost got in a fight. (I twisted bluds arm and he almost started 😂😂😂)"
I didn't care and sucks for them bcz I became a menace after some of those instances. They whised that I just left their class/school
Oh my god this is the fucking worst
"I hate how the response to each of those questions and prompted reactions of the video were identical to the Vietnam flashbacks I got while enduring this. So fucking glad I’m a tall goth so I can just give a withering glare at people doing the adult version of this, god I’m so glad I’m not a teenager anymore"

On god bruh
So relatable!
"Ive had this happen. But instead of this. It was the popular dudes... and being the quit dude in class, who looks overly frooty and gay. They teased me. Exactly like that. But a lottle more direct. Like, they showed interest. But the wrong reasons. They twisted my words. They spread rumors. And they fucked my last 2 years of school.

Fun times. High school. 

For my last year. Im in a diffirent school. And im succeeding. I have slightly better friends. But i am more social ajd likes. So thats fun."
sometimes i wonder what would happen if i just answer them sarcastically til they're as pissed off as i am

Wasn't even safe wt home. Some of them tried a messaging ploy. Luckily I'm not a dumbass so I saw through it

This actually happened to me and it filled me with so much rage
this hurt
Core memory unlocked
People pulled this shit on me once and i responded by threatening them and they didn't speak to me for the rest of middle school
Slowly pulls out ak
Quiet kid intensifies
"An elementary/ high school friend and I were in the same AP class, and I saw this happen to them daily. They needed more help understanding social cues than me, so I could tell what these classmates were doing based on patterns I’d learned in both elementary school and middle school (I had horrible experiences in middle school from people who made fun of my autistic mannerisms). However, when I told them what these classmates were doing, my friend thought “I” was being mean to “them.” Even my close friends were like “WTF?” The mental gymnastics bullies put autistic people through makes me sick of to the pit of my stomach."
She’s begging for an eye-gouge and eardrum slap.
"Just found out about 6 months ago I have autism, this used to happen to me all the time and would make me so uncomfortable. It's crazy looking back on my life and seeing so clear now why I always felt like I missed the intro class to social behavior XD"
"Autistic guy here, this happened all my life but now I learned how to talk to people and got buff as fuck. People don’t do this anymore but when I think about it I still feel like a little fat kid sometimes."
"had this happen to me this year. i chose to no longer care about those who think i’m weird or quiet because i’m just trying to live my life and be better to myself and others. that being said, i passionately hate anyone who does this"
I was really short and shy while in middle and elementary school. Feel this in my soul.
This made me wonder how many knives I can fit in my chest
She is oddly good at this… makes me wonder if she was “that girl” in school
This is bring back memories 🫥
"Can't relate, don't know why my younger self was absolutely unhinged and just talked to people whenever about whatever and manage to make friends 

Right know i would probably just stare in disbelief of the disrespect im experiencing 😶"
Idk why they do I just wanna go home

This makes me want to die.
She must do that IRL.
watching this made me wanna knock some teeth out. i absolutely despise people who pull this shit
im not autistic (i think) and i experienced this. got so bad i  had to walk out.
This happens to me all the time 😭😭 I always just try and ignore them tho
the acting is  👌
Fucking hate when people do this to me
This gives new life to memories that did not deserve life to begin with.
This is why I don't talk to people
I would’ve told them to fuck off
I chime in with a “Haven’t you people ever heard of closing the Goddamn door?!”
This is accurate
Actually so real it's fucking annoying
literally no difference here
This brings back some not fun memories.
"Tbh, this is why I can't wait for my reunion (no one told me about the 5 yr so I'll crash the 10 yr) bc now I'm with a wealthy guy who's family is well known and respected and I look way better than in school.

We know who the quiet kid is shooting first
I’ve seen this shit happen
These mfers were in one of my classes last year and every time I saw them I wanted to take a bite out of my arm because the pain of that wouldnt even be comparible to the pain of hearning their smug voices everyday
"Pov (my school life): you are the intelligent teen and you are bullied by a Gay, some bipolar girls, some girls that go to disco at 12 y/o and to all the rest of the class, only because you are the only one who studies, think that I’m bullied firstly because of my body, secondly because I do not have any relationship out of school so they can talk bad about me after school, think that I have this situation since I was 10"
"I have dealt with this in one specific class in highschool but I'm probably lucky because I have friends, just none in that class so I'm usually quiet, and everytime those mfers see me they would do this exact thing but usually I would just slowly look at them and say ""yup"""
"I’m gonna start carrying a bell around, and then when someone walks up to me to talk as a joke, I’m just gonna pull a Hector Salamanca"
"Fucking most of my interactions, I'm high functioning plus ADHD and OCD. Fun stuff. Not to mention borderline personality depression and anxiety. All diagnosed."
I hate this so much
God damnit this happened to me in high school  and I now I’m older I want to fucken kill the bitches who did this shit to me
what sucks is that this is what its like at my school
We all knew someone like this
I can't take this anymore
how am I supposed to know it's even a joke though
"If anyone here actually does this shit, I hope you know there is a special place in hell for you, shit brains."
This is giving me flashbacks god i hate this
This didn’t happen to me but I saw it happen many times to people in my class. the bitch girls make it super fucking obvious that there fucking with you
I’m hella introverted and unattractive and this has happened to me a few times ever since I moved halfway across the US. I know that they don’t actually mean anything they say but a small part of me wants to believe that they do and I hate it so much.

Kevin and I: *Exchange of glances, then uncontrolled laughter.*

Why did this happen to me alot
Pov your looking at anAverage porn star actor
I hate how relatable this is
And here I was thinking she’s autistic because she can’t seem to make her eyes agree with what she’s saying or maintain eye contact with the person she’s talking to.
I ignored/walked away whenever this happened to me

The accuracy in this 😭😭
"Fortunately my disfunction means these do nothing for me I find them Irritating “Leave me Alone annoying people my time is preeecious” 🤷🏻‍♂️

If I need your company , I’ll hire it by the hour thank you ."
"Me and my friends who are popular do this? Were not trying to bully we just find it as teasing, just how we tease eachother? Do people really hate this stuff😭"
Clearly this is bullying but how do you even call them out on it? You'd just have to like throw it back at them and start asking them dumb questions but still they get the thrill from doing thus with their friends present and will talk to you when you're alone. I don't know.
WHY AM I TRIGGERED
The amount of hurt I felt when one girl didn’t come to school and when I spoke to them they brushed me off. I thought I had made friends
"That happens to me every other day, so do you know what I did? I somehow befriended them. I don't fucking know how, but I did."
"Well it also happened to me , good think past me was smart enough to not get into that stuff"
"I was aware enough to know that I was being fucked with when they would do this shit, but couldn't tell when I was being flirted with.  I mean, it was 100% fat and/or goth girls flirting with me, but still flattering in hindsight!  Those were friend people."
"As a person who has asperger's, when people do crap like this, the mental anguish is real"
This makes me want to hug every *quiet* teen so badly 😖 And I wish back then I would have had the security and words to tell these fake inquirers that *I am not quiet. I just haven’t encountered anybody who I feel inclined to have a meaningful conversation with right now. If you will excuse me now…?*
Who is she?

"I've always wondered what is like inside these people's heads. Like do they see someone and think""hey yeah I'm gonna be an asshole to them""? Because obviously I'm life everyone thinks they're the good guy, otherwise why do what you do? But how can these people think they are the good guy?"
I did NOT give her permission to write my biography
I want to commit self hurty
"One time they came up to me and said I looked like Sid from Toy Story. I was just happy to have someone interact with me. I even let them take a picture of me, which they immediately used to create a side by side comparison."
I had this happen before. Essentially they started talking to me and then said that someone had a crush on me but I obviously didn’t believe them because for one it was obvious. I still blushed at it though as they pointed it out
"Happened to me a lot since I was always silent not weird or anything, only spoke when spoken to"
"I don’t get this, what’s the problem here?"
I was popular in school so I was friends with quiet kids it doesn’t hurt to just be kind to ppl making fun of people is weird asf
This would happen to me and I would just play along
Reeeeeee!
Wait a minute…😂
Thats when I pull out my gun
TOO REAALLL
It’s so weird cause I remember this happening to me in some classes as like a sophmore. Then shit happened and I got a lot of friends suddenly and my “friends” were doing this shit to other kids I think. I guess it’s not the same cause it was guy to guy
Yeah
this triggered something deep within me

I don't blame you if you start shooting (I'm Italian btw)
Just look her in the eyes and after shes done talking to you tell her you'll visit her tonight

This is far too relatable.

"This always happened to me in 8th grade, i thought i was a likable kid who got along with everyone, when it was the later half of the year, i realized that the only reason they were nice to me is bc they were just looking for laughs, gotta be the clown, right?"
I’m not even lying this happened to me probably 2-3 times a week for the entirely of middle school and half of high school. Fuck the popular kids fr
this hurts.
they knew i had guns too and sometimes i worry they thought i was gonna shoot up the school but oh well high schools done
"As an autistic kid I never experienced this or have even ever been bullied or anything like that, and thank god I wasn't. I think it's because I wasn't known as ""the autistic kid"" and I'm pretty sure no one actually knew I was autistic since I didn't have any friends hence no one to talk to, I kept to myself most days until I changed schools, things are a lot better now 👍"
Fun game reply how you would and point out how she’s not even listening to you
As someone who has Asperger’s this was me for years. I didn’t talk to anyone cause I didn’t know how. I didn’t know how to express emotions and I only talked to a couple people. I fu king hate people like this
I've always been the smart but quiet kid. Any time they need some help in Spanish? This conversation. ELA? This conversation. History? This conversation. It's gotten to the point where I doubt my own friends even genuinely want to talk to me.
"This like...hurts. like, I feel my chest tightening like I'm getting ready for it. Im 21 now but I'm a guy who was exclusively bullied by girls from 1st to 5th grade, so the whole thing about asking what they're reading and everything felt like I was remembering something I locked away so hard I forgot"
"When this happened to me, when it got to the part like in this video where they ask you ""oh BTW this person likes you, do you like them back"" I straight up said EUGHH.

I knew they did it as a prank to anyone who doesn't talk a lot. as petty as it sounds on my end, it felt good to turn it around on them because they got all embarrassed when other kids overheard and started laughing. 

I get this sounds like a ""and everyone clapped"" kind of story writing this out now lol"

"They just want to act like the bigger person by „having mercy and giving the quiet kid a chance“. Yeah right and I feel soo much better that you assume my whole fucking personality is „quiet“. You know, if you don’t want to talk to me without acting like i’m insane, don’t talk to me. I hate this conversation as much as you do, maybe even more. I don’t need your „pity“ if we could even describe pity as fucking telling me to kill myself just because I don’t talk much. I hate it, I will always hate these people. And I will never be happy."

Same thing happened to me except they pretended that a guy I liked actually liked me. This was one of the main things that decreased my self esteem in high school.
I still to this day genuinely thought all of those people wanted to be friends with me. This has ruined me.

If this happened during class, and the teacher was absent minded enough to not notice this happening, they sure noticed when I just stood up and left."

"It's funny, in your 20s and 30s, being different and having special abilities or features gives you an edge, it's just the youth years where it's desirable to all be the same. Fuck that, live gets better after school anyways."
"how are you NOT one of cool kids? I thought deeper voices were worth like 10,000 cool points?? lol"
I didn't realise until the final year...
####that's so cool! 🙊
"Similar experience, but a girl in 7th grade gym less than a week after I started at the school. Fortunately, I found a good group of friends I ended up totally fucking up, but they kept bullies like this off my back."
"We are all here for this same reason, amongst many others. Shit hurts man…"
Same
It didn't work :(
you're so lucky! all the best 💌
What it really was was that I didn't know what to say to make them stop.
"True.


I liked the way you said ""friends"" instead of friends. They call everyone friends they talked more than 5 mins and forget them when graduates."
Nah let's find her first.
Her fucking voice makes it all the worse
That would be the best karma ever
Is everything okay man? You know this is just a POV right?
doesn't work
Most of them do it for attention and do exactly what she demonstrates. They’ll go to you smiling and start smirking to each other taking you for a dumbass. They don’t respect you or give a fuck about you.
"Sure they didn't laugh and call you a freak buddy? Sure they didn't shout to all their friends telling them what weird creepy shit you just said? 

I get you need fantasies but we all know what happened"

"bro I ain’t autistic, but it sure is annoying to be called, “quiet kid.” They reference things to school shootings. What the fuck, guys."
"It happened to me, too. They got bored after a while and started to go to a kid who thinks he's popular, but I think everyone hates him. During recess, we have a hill where people roll down or push people down, and he decided to push me down, so I fought back and landed in mud."
"I remember kids that this happened to and me, being the rage-addled little gremlin that my mom created, flipping out on this shit.  I would grab whatever was near me and throw it at the perpetrators.  

Kids are so insane that my lunacy made me relatively popular because people would get a kick out of me flipping out.  Needless to say, I had many detentions and many suspension, and was eventually expelled in tenth grade. Mostly because my parents refused to get me psychological help."
My whole life in school I've  had a  problem where people think it's real funny to piss me off and I think it's had long term effects
So… you became the “berserk skeleton” meme?
"Good think I did the same thing , unfortunetly a lot of people got on that"
Let's do it threegether
Count me in
"I guess I was semi-lucky for not being put in any public school unlike y'all

*But sometimes, I wish I was put into public school*"
I like you pfp lol
"Good take , cool stuff about the music but I kinda missed the point , but you have a good taste (says the whitehouse fan)"
Yes
"But of those that know, few give a shit to intercede."
thats great. i will use this
Oh shit. But I heard he was actually trying to get in shape but I don’t know how that went along
He's recovering now so you might have awhile left to live
Same
U mean their comment?
"You were allowed to leave the cafeteria during lunch? Damn, in my high school, if you needed to use the bathroom during lunch, you had to beg for permission. Definitely couldn't eat anywhere except in the cafeteria."
"sometimes, at one of the schools i used to go to the teachers would let students eat in their classrooms and i would take advantage of that bc of kids like these in the video above or bc it was too loud in the cafeteria and i liked the quiet"
I thought they were just being weird to be honest
I always felt like they were up to something but i couldn’t place a finger on it till now
"THE FUCK DID YOU COME FROM, THE FUCKING SOUTH?!?! (I would know I’m from there the men here are hyper aggressive, I’m a man myself born as a man,is their tap water different or something?)"
"Honestly preferred those guys, they were completely upfront with their intentions."
Thank you :D
Thank you very much
Thank you :D
I don’t know man
To die in front of her? Good idea.
Yeah man everything’s great - I have a son with autism so I take peoples bs like this here a little bit personal- if you had the mental fortitude to understand that what people say have lasting impacts perhaps you would respond differently.
expecting people to hate you before they know you is a terrible mindset btw and I hope you grow out of it one day
Mongo doesn’t socialize.
🥲
I apologize to god when I meet him.
[removed]
"At some point, I started embracing the fact that people thought I was a school shooter in the making."
"I’ve honestly been fine with it, a lot of people know that we own some and I used to fit the role a bit but it’s stopped people from messing with me like this. I mostly am pretty quiet but I just like to be left alone most times so it helps when I need it to"
"Well that must sucked or sucks , don't let it get to you"
"I had a similar experience. It’s just that they never stopped and started to outright bully me, so my teachers had to let me stay inside during recess because they never were able to handle these issues."
"Well that must sucked , hope it its better for you now"
"I kinda figured shit out on my own because parents also refused psychological help, and figured I should fix things myself which led to substance using"
Yeah this exact mentality is why challenged kids decide to pick up guns
"Basically, and at the tail end of senior high a few years ago me and a lot of people just reacted like the skeletons whenever someone tried to do this to me

In senior high"
Let's do it fourgether
I like frog and nouns they my intro to like weird experimental Indie shit and my life is never been the same since
Happy cake day!
Happy birthday
Happy Cake Day!
"Yes the comment, it confuses me. Wether they are shrugging it off, like THEY DID IT AT ONE POINT, or THEY ACTUALLY FIND IT FUNNY, which alarms me. Or they laugh bc it’s relatable."
same
It's leaded (it's where all the leaded gasoline went)
"Oh I mean I was oversimplifying, it was more light bullying and stealing your stuff until you fought back, and then they’d skip to fighting"
"I apologise I came off rude, I just meant that I’ve followed her on TikTok for a while and her acting comes from real life experiences, at least as far as I’m aware she’s not actually one of those people. I can see the argument about how it might be wrong to exploit plenty of people’s trauma for content, but all I meant was (and maybe I just interpreted your comment wrong) this wasn’t a video personally directed at you or anyone."
"Wow it seems like you’ve never been at school and experienced this. They almost always do this because they find it funny. 

Your speaking on something that has never happened to you, and this has happened to me several times. Even when you show that you want to be left alone they play it off and keep going. They have 0 boundaries and dont give a fuck about how you feel."
El Diablo lol
Now that's entertainment. Big ol film camera with a shoulder stock that sorta looks like a gun
Don't do this
Hey hold on here
That's terrible. I hope your life is better now
Yea. I got myself help around the age of 26.
Sorry to hear that. Hope everything worked out.
Let's do it fivegether
"I have no idea from what is that , posibbly their ambient stuff or like total sex or something. I close my intrest in Birdseed , Crusie , Astetic 2006 and NWW colabs"
thanks dude
💀
"Oirs just don't have fluorine as there's no central water system in half the houses and everybody uses well.

so everyone's got shit teeth."
"Oof, must’ve been rough, here in the sout it’s normally if you offend them in a minor way and stand your ground, you best watch your back for the next few weeks."
"I did have this experience in middle school but as I grew up I realized that it was my mindset rather than reality, because my parents inadvertently taught me that ""people suck"" and if you go into every interaction expecting people to suck it isnt good for you"
"Well don’t plan on doing it twice, that mall cop they have posted up roaming around is waiting for his day to shine, and you’re going to give it to him."
"No no he's got a point

He meant everything he does can and would be interpreted by Nancy Drew wannabes to be a school shooter

There will be a point where you just say ""Fuck it, may as well"""
"Yes it is. It took a while and I do have still flashbacks to it, but all in all I’m good."
Good for you 👍
"Kinda did. And it took physical ailments for me to stop substance abuse, tho I still have some cravings"
Sixthether
"I MEANT TO SAY, I LOVE YOU FIVE EVER( that means he loves her more then forever)"
Why?
"I meannn, Im not in a big city so mild physical abuse isn’t the worst, also despite being a small chubby kid, I was surprisingly good in a fight:)"
"I think this video explained why it’s annoying. They always share some smirk to each other, or say “This person (Insert friends name) likes you”  as a way to get to their friend using you. Also have you noticed that most of the people who do things like this are popular students? Do you really think they care about talking to individual students? Most of us just want to be left alone not barraged by someone and their 3-5 friends. Its fucking annoying and they’re attention seekers."
I’m a recovering alcoholic so I totally understand. Stay strong.
Sevengether
Ily sixever
"NICE! I’m a southern city boy, but I have friends who were from the countryside, and boy, it sounds rough, here in the city it’s mostly mental trauma and intangible attacks."
"yeah they're probably popular because they cold approach people and they just want to cold approach you, but you're being unreceptive so they probably wont talk to you again. Also this specific video isnt how it always happens and is an exaggeration, and saying""x likes you"" is a common way to tease both people and try to have a laugh with you"

Not being able to keep friends no matter how hard you try
Getting bullied as a kid but only realizing years later
not being able to get comfortable because every position feels so insanely wrong
"saying ""what?"" not because you didn't understand them, but you need time to process"
Talking to myself allll the time. I talk to myself like I’m another person in the room even though it’s just me. I could rant to myself for hours and no one understands or they think it’s weird.
something i experience often that i don’t think nt people do is alexithymia. i will sometimes feel hypomanic but depressed at the same time and it’s very confusing. or just having a really hard time identifying what emotion i’m feeling unless it’s very intense.
"Liking a musician or album sooooo much that it is literally all I want to listen to every day for a month and desperately wanting to talk to people about their music all the time. But needing to hold back so I don't annoy my friends lol.

(My special interest is music)"
"Having to repeat myself 3-4 times in a neurotypical conversation only to realize they're not listening to you because they're not interested in what you're saying. When I'm not interested in something or if I wasn't listening I say outloud ""sorry I'm not listening"" or ""sorry i'm not interested."" Please just save me to the embarrassment and tell me you're not listening or you're not interested."
feeling like you were an alien growing up
trauma from gym class
"lived in california and wore the same gigantic red hoodie every day, even in 100 degree weather. loved that thing. my parents had to fight me (verbally) to get me to wear something else so they could wash it. they threw it away as soon as we moved to tennessee so i’d stop wearing it"
"Struggling so much with transitions that, as a child, it would be a time-consuming, challenging ordeal to try to coax me to get in the car, and upon arrival to the destination, it was equally impossible to get me out of the car. (Did anyone else do this?)"
Always having to wear comfortable clothes and never having a sense of style
"Being extremely excited to see a train, even when I’m stuck at a crossing."
I tear the tags out of most of my clothes and wear my socks inside out because I can't stand the seams. (I've done this as long as I can remember.)
I think the thing most autistic people are suprised about is that eye contact isnt literally staring into someones soul. I have done that all my life and just recently someone told me I should stop staring but I was just making eye contact because idk thats what you have to do while talking to someone
"Taking 1 to 2 hours to fall asleep every night bc i am the princess from princess and the pea and i can feel every microscopic peice of dust and im not laying right so i need to make 1038492872 microajustments but i need to have an empty bladder to sleep so i get up to pee 6 times and then the microadjustments again then i need to pee then microadjust and listen to a minecraft longplay but now i feel a spec of dust again and i need to sweep the crumbs out and now im back in bed and i need to microadjust for 30 minutes again

Edit: i also need a weighed blanket on my feet, a blanket covering my ears, a stuffed animal to hug and a blackout eye-mask"
Getting overstimulated by a single piece of paper turning when I'm already stressed
"When I went on holiday to Spain and refused wear any outfit my mum had bought as it was ""too tight"", yes I stayed a week in a jumper, trainers and leggings in 26 degree heat.
Everyone else wore dresses and shorts. I never found what I was wearing to be inappropriate for weather. I actually felt the most comfortable, my mum thought looked silly. I was 13.

Or the times I get into a full blown argument with my partner and he says ""I'm joking"", and I still can't drop it and carry on replying in a realistic way like that's impossible. I'm serious like that. I don't do jokes or sarcasm.

The time I would visit my nan and I knew when we left we would all give a hug and a kiss, I would wait outside before leaving time just to avoid that.

The recent video I looked back on at age 9 on the beach, I'm wet and have sand all over me... my dad asks whats wrong, I just flap my hands and demand I need to take my top off... while flapping my hands still."
I used to memorize MPAA movie ratings when I was a kid 1) because reading them was fun and 2) I wanted to shelter myself from explicit content in case no one else did it for me. I’m the lawful good brand of autism 🙃
"When I was younger I had an organized checklist for how I would play with my pokemon toys, all in a specific order, every Saturday. I never brought it up with anyone or wondered if anyone else did it but I never thought it wasn't necessarily normal lmao"
Umm.. hopefully I’m not alone here but.. stepping on water drops on a hard surfaced floor and just hating the experience. It absolutely interrupts my task and I need to fix it by cleaning it or putting my indoor shoes on. If I’m worn down I can totally freak out over the experience and struggle to remain somewhat contained. My feet/legs are very sensitive to negative stimuli..
"Saying ""yeah"" when someone asks how you're doing/feeling because it's hard to identify emotions and the only way you can think to describe it is ""normal,"" except normal isn't a ""feeling"""
Going to dinner with a group of people and not ordering anything or talking.
I can't understand sports and they make me very stressed out.
Bawling your fucking eyes out/screaming bloody murder in the corner of a classroom.
Repeating numbers or words are soothing.
Hmm… tough one to generalize but I’ll give it a shot- word cluttering every third sentence because the thoughts I want to express happen much faster than remembering social the cues to say them. Although I know other ND’s aside from autism struggle with this part of speaking for various reasons.
[deleted]
Buying multiple copies of something you like in case it gets discontinued.
Creating rules and methods FOR EVERY SINGLE THING IN LIFE and getting way too stressed if not able to follow them
"Being bad at conversation. If there's no prompt, there's no game."
"\- Being weirdly obssessed about a thing for weeks on end only to completely forget about it all of a sudden. My most recent case being the Battle of Yonkers from World War Z which led me to binge consume zombie media, I even got the book lol... now I leave it unfinished along with every other zombie media I recently acquired (namely the show All of Us Are Dead, Dying Light 1 & 2 and Dead Island 2) as I got bored of it;

\- Being bothered by things that don't bother most people (in my case people singing, the texture of some foods like cake, tags on clothing, sound of people knocking on glass, among others);

\- Enjoying a medium more for the worldbuilding and lore because you hardly ever are able to empathize or relate to characters (or at least not as much as an allistic can);

\- Liking anime and jRPG's as an adult. The ""cringe"" most people dislike about it (power of friendship, over the top dialogue, etc) is what you like because it makes the characters easier to read since they express themselves more obviously. 

\- Being asked why I am so upset when I am just talking to people on a neutral tone. Allistic tendency to interpret directness as hostility will never make sense to me, but I have learned to accept it in order to navigate the world as an adult;

\- Being unable to enter management roles because I working with a job that requires constant socialization overwhelms me, sometimes to the point of meltdowns. Used to be a Tech Lead on Dev squad on my last job, on my new one I have been ""demoted"" to just being a software dev (the quotes because I actually make more money now lol) and am immensely more happy as I can just work in peace and quiet all day with no meetings or people calling me all day."
"Not experiencing peer pressure and as a kid always asking ""why""?"
"Ah yes, the ""they're clearly just trying to pathologize normal child behavior"" to autism diagnosis pipeline lol"
"Ever since I started eating food on my own, I’ve been categorizing it outside and inside of my mouth. Like I have an order for eating which consists of eating one specific ingredient first and one at a time. I don’t do this as much with those kinds of foods that already have all the ingredients well mixed together (which explains why I don’t like those sorts of foods). Also I make sure that I chew a similar or equal size of whatever I eat inside my mouth. Like I separate inside or I analyze sizes of fruits (like grapes) and cut them in half or separate them.


My dad always insisted that when you mix food it tastes much better, but I couldn’t disagree more. I hate when the textures get all mixed, and it’s just really messy. Like apparently the way I eat infuriates him sometimes that he basically begs me to mix food while eating lol"
"1. Being called weird for being highly interested in something 
2. Being punished for small mistakes at school other kids could easily get away with. 
3. Being ignored the whole game you’re trying to play with “friends” at recess while they all work together 
4. Barely being let do anything with group projects to the point where you have to get the teacher involved for guardrailing 
5. Being told to suck it up when a noise is hurting your ears 
6. Being treated like you’re emotionless"
"When I was a kid, probably 4 or 5, there was a span of several months where I would watch the original cartoon of *How The Grinch Stole Christmas* on VHS, multiple times a day, every day. I also have actual trauma stemming from an incident when I refused to eat cereal with milk (I just don’t do it. It’s gross)."
"Vocal tics, specifically ""아니다""  (from bff#2 of going seventeen said by my beloved vernon) and ""get 'em"" (mayor Tyler cutebiker of gravity falls). The latter got me in trouble (jokingly) because I kept typing it in chat when my friends were streaming and Em is one of their nicknames. 

Also apparently it wasn't normal for a 6 year old to recognize a dog breed on sight :/"
Jokes. Man they are so hard to understand in social events.
I was at a homestuck meeting and a girl said we should hang out like just us. Together. I said yeah ok. This was an invitation to date. I never spoke to her again becausei forgot.
Working at a retail customer service desk for four months being one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. I can still barely walk into a hardware store.
"hey i'm new here.  
as a kid and sometimes still today, when my parents or someone i have to rely on, for example for transportation, choses to be super spontaneous and go to a place i haven't been to yet.  
also, making me get something by myself when i was little. especially in a foreign environment. this didn't have anything to do with lack of confidence, i'd just panic internally cause i didn't know what to say/ handle the situation due to lack of reference points.  
as long as i can remember messing with my hair, running my hand through repetitively, which caused my mom to cut my hair super short when i was little.  
she wasn't aware that i "" needed"" that.  
tags on panties drive me insane and i hate bras.  
i usually buy shoes a third or up to full size bigger cause when i'm wearing them for too long the pressure on my feet gets unbearable.  
i ask "" know what i mean"" a lot cause in my experience, people just don't, even if i'm super clear and straightforward. do i really not make sense?  
being caressed, especially on my arms feels like torture after like a minute or 2, it starts hurting.  
my brain goes weird directions sometimes, especially when the atmosphere is getting lose and fun. when i'm starting to feel somewhat "" normal"" or part of something,   
i'd mess it up and either say or post something that others don't understand, they don't make the same connections.  
it could just be something based on how a word sounds, like misheard lyrics which would give what's been said a whole new meaning.  
that's when i get reminded how weird i am apparently based on the reactions and i start to kinda hate myself again."
"Having a meltdown because nobody remembered my birthday, when I didn’t understand that nobody knew my birthday because I didn’t tell them beforehand so they had no way to know it. I was turning 19. Woops 🥲"
So many things about food
"An insane hatred for the ""how are you?"" as just politieness. I never how to reply, and I' colelcting gold phrases to remember, since no one sincerely asks, and if they actually do, then it's also very specific what you're 'allowed' to answer or not. 

I hate it here"
"Needing clothes and shoes to fit me in a particular way, and being profoundly sensitive to the materials and manner of fit. 

For instance, I need my shoes secured tightly, I always have; when I was younger I tightened them almost to the point of cutting off circulation! I’m more careful now, although I still need them tight - but if one shoe is looser, I’ll notice it all day. 

In contrast, I can’t wear constricted clothing, like tights or body-shaping clothes. I take a lot of pleasure from colour-coordinating my clothes and I love clothes in general, but I do tend to prioritise comfort over anything else. If one thing about my outfit is weird or different, I will notice it all day."
being the only one stimming in a big group of people.
Being painfully aware that the reason people don't like me is because I'm autistic.
"Thinking in a very just way. I dislike my nephew’s new wife and I know she dislikes me too. Thing is this all started because she was rude whenever I behaved like myself. I was talking to my sister about how I love my other nephew’s girlfriend and my sister says “she’s great. But you’re not always going to like someone and someone is not always going to like you”. I was like mind fucking blown. Why can’t people just date good people?  Why’d you have to bring this mess into my life? Lmao. I should say my nephews are less than ten years younger than me so I’m not some crazy old aunt wagging her finger at them. 

Also being really bad at sports. I was tall as a kid so my siblings and parents were like you can be a model oh you can play basketball and stuck me in sports. I remember making a basket for the wrong side. Baseball season came and I was always in outfield I imagine not paying any god damn attention. I also remember kids saying “thanks a lot ______.” When I “cost” them a game. Good times. Also fell a lot so wouldn’t have been a good model. 

In HS I was terrified of men and thought that I had no game. In retrospect, I did in fact have no game. But I always thought it was cause I was ugly. Cause ugly had to equal no one liking you and attractive meant people liked you. I Can see now that people did in fact like me. I was asked to a dance, to parties, etc. but there were times I had guys I thought were “out of my league”
Come to talk to me and I was like why are they here?  Is this a joke?"
"A big issue for me is being so unaware of social cues and growing up with *ahem* a dad with interest in civil war sympathizers made me very blind to issues of race and other things.  I didn’t understand what was bad about the rebel flag so it led to a lot of people thinking I was racist.  I had always been told it wasn’t, so I was just confused hearing it was.  Like I can’t judge these tricky topics myself and I had been taught wrong my whole life, but in these situations I would apologize and say sorry I’m autistic it makes it difficult to judge these kinds of things, it would only make people more mad and say I’m “using it as an excuse” like, what?  Allistic people are so ignorant of what autism is and they say they’re accepting and inclusive and then actively bully me for having misunderstandings based on my autism and take it at face value.  Even though literally nothing about me is racist.  I also don’t understand how saying you have POC friends is a “racist card” like if I was *really* racist, do you think any self respecting person of color would want anything to do with me?  No.  It’s racist to not have black friends but it’s also racist to say you do?  Social issues are a nightmare for me."
"Having a meltdown and then realizing you scared your friends away. I know it doesn't happen to most, but im sure it happens to some 😭"
"I can say in general, I’ve had really bad issues with being aware of my body in relation to the world around me. There have been many times when I’ve invaded peoples personal space unknowingly whilst moving about and it has led to people getting angry at me."
"Someone went to hand me food I had ordered yesterday. It was a takeaway, so we were at the entrance to my building. He had his hand out, the food hanging from his wrist like a bracelet. I presume he thought I'd put my hand out, and he'd slide the food onto my hand/wrist. Being the classic autist that I am: I shook his hand instead. He burst out laughing in confusion before I realized he wanted to give me my food. A very wholesome moment overall lol."
I used to have absolute meltdowns if my parents took my brother and I somewhere after church without telling us. Even if it was like… panera or somewhere fun
"I would, but people next to me talk too loud and one of them has really unpleasant voice and I can’t concentrate on accessing my memories."
"At uni being told in my professional assessment I have a 'cold personality, am shut off and hard to work with' by the chair person of a theatre union. When I'm internally panicking/overwhelmingly excited that it's my first big project and that I'm getting to work with a big time professional.

Generally instances of people interpreting my blank faced internal doom spirals as anger or apathy.

Also asking a baby, what it knows about hats but let's not dwell on that one"
"I find an inexplicable satisfaction in reading and “decoding” license plates. There is no ACTUAL decoding going on. My mind just plays with the numbers and letters and finds relationships between them, for some reason. Easily the most autistic thing I do is just needing alone time though. Like, I spend a LOT of time alone - more than NTs think is normal. Even when I’m in a house with family & friends, I often just need to get away to my room, a bathroom, or a quiet, separate space and know that I can escape to that place, even when I don’t need to at the moment. 

I’m not sure if this is an autistic thing, but I have a lot of trouble making out what people are saying when I’m in a somewhat noisy environment where other people seem to be able to talk to each other just fine. It’s not as if I can no longer hear the person. It’s just like the sounds become a moving target in the noise, and my brain can’t quite lock onto their words anymore. Idk. Curious if anyone else experiences this"
"I’m not interested in sports where two teams compete to move an object to a goal - hockey, basketball, etc.

When I was a teen in the 80’s, before the internet, I used to collect statistics from the sports section in the newspaper because the statistics from those sports fascinate me.

If I were to train for a new career, it almost certainly would be something related to data science."
"“Common sense” scenarios aren’t so common sense to me. Telling me “I need help moving” does nothing. What exactly do you need help with? Packing? How do you want everything packed? Oh, you need help putting things in the truck while YOU pack. Got it. How do you want me to arrange things in the truck? What do you mean obviously the couch goes first? We’ve got lots of different ways we can do this I just want to know what way you like best. Why are you so upset? No, I’m not trying to add unnecessary steps, I want to help you how you would like to be helped. What am I doing wrong here?"
"When I developed a formula for comforting upset people. I also came up with a method to make friends, when I told other people, they were confused about why I had a detailed list of things to do to make a friend."
"Being in trouble at school for ""mocking"" other people. Nah dude thats just the echolalia..."
I laugh at inappropriate times
My entire childhood.
"Man there's probably alot idk where to start, probably forgot a few"
"Realizing I had actually had texture issues. There are two specific foods I still avoid, shrimp and mushrooms, and while I like flan, the texture will eventually make me feel like I'm going to hurl. With the shrimp, one time I ordered it at a restaurant as a kid, I was expecting something small like popcorn shrimp, which doesn't bug me as much, I got JUMBO SHRIMP, and by God I had a meltdown and refused to eat it. It was as big as my head.

Also bring hyper aware of what my body is experiencing, I have a natural low temp (not to an alarming level, but my normal temp is around 96, one time it was actually 99 and I knew I was sick) and I told my family brushed me off, I vomited in their car and they were shocked. Like, I told y'all I didn't feel well, and that I had a temperature, y'all ignored me and then got upset with me for puking. I'm kiiiiind of a hypochondriac because of this, yet I also refuse to actually go see a doctor, I became a lab tech so I could learn about that kind of stuff on my own. I know exactly what is wrong with me.

Also as a kid I didn't know what thirst felt like, so I would get seizures from being dehydrated, but I learned after the first time that seeing an aura meant I had to chug water, or I would puke and have a killer migraine.

Years later I got drenched to the bone, had bronchitis for a month (was currently going through army basic training so I refused to get seen, I didn't want to be held back from graduating) and ever since then I've hated reason, only to realize I have sensory issues with my clothes being wet and close to my skin, which also explains why showering is a struggle for me.

Also I'm a super light sleeper. My husband or dog moves, I'll wake up. My husband also snores to the point where I can feel it through the mattress. I sleep with an eye mask and nose cancelling earbuds with white noise, because otherwise I'll wake to every tiny noise.

I also used to get heat stroke, but it was hard for me to really tell, I at least tried to stay hydrated but it just felt like I was going into a shut down."
"I'm very textual so I have to be wearing clothes that don't distract or irritate me. Things like wool, tags, and dirt will send me into a meltdown. I do a lot of self grooming especially running my hands through my hair. Also good ol minimal eye contact can't forget that one.

My speech can get very repetitive I use a lot of filler words like, like and so. I avoid them when I can but if I detect repetitiveness I get really frustrated."
I've gotten a lot worse since I got old. I talk to myself the whole t ime at the  the gr ocery store
"My biggest one has always been my food touching. If something is mixed before it’s served, I’m absolutely fine with it. But if there is say corn, green beans, and chicken on my plate, none of it better touch or I’ll get grossed out. Usually at restaurants, I spend the first few minutes after getting my food, making sure each item is completely separated from the others. And you might say “why don’t you get divided plates?” NO! Using those is worse than my food touching! The spaces can be too small for the portion I want, not enough spots for the amount of items I want, and it’s a hassle to separate if one piece of food crosses over the divider. The one acceptation I will make is most holidays. I’ll pille as much food on a plate as possible during thanksgiving or Christmas.

I’m also a ‘one item at a time’ eater. I can only focus on eating one thing at a time before I move on to the next. As a kid, I would eat all of the grain cereals out of my lucky charms first, then individually eat the marshmallows in order. Balloons first, then 4 leaf clover hats, then shooting stars, etc."
Somewhat subtle sarcasm...or a joke going completely over your head.
"Having to go around the supermarket in a specific route when grocery shopping.

TBF, most of my autistic behaviours I didn't realise were 'weird' until I left home. My younger brother is severely autistic, and I'm pretty sure my mum is as well as most of my issues and behaviours I got from her, so it was very normalised in my house, leading to me not getting diagnosed until a few weeks ago at 27 (I'm female).

I also seemed drawn to other 'weird kids', as my best friend from primary school (I'm in England) was later diagnosed with autism, and most of my uni friends are autistic, plus my friend who I've known on and off since we were 4 was diagnosed last year..."
"The joke with the chicken. The chicken wants to DIE, not cross the road 😭😭😭😭 Literal thinking with all the jokes, in general. 
Sorry for the bad English, I'm learning"
"There was this one time I was at a family gathering at my aunt's house. We were playing this game where you divide into two teams and sit in a circle, alternating team members. You pass this device around the circle that has a timer and gives each person a new word. The person who has the device has to try to describe that word without actually saying the word. Their teammates have to guess the word for them to pass it to the other team before the timer runs out. So now that you have context, we were playing this game at my aunt's house. My cousin who was one of my teammates was trying to describe a word. He said ""it's what my mom spends all her money on so we don't have any left for anything else"". Well, my aunt is well known to love alcohol and always has it in stock at her house, they were drinking it during the game. I blurted out ""ALCOHOL!!"" I was completely serious, and not trying to insult anyone. I couldn't think of a better answer. And to my complete SHOCK, everyone burst out laughing so hard they cried! I wasn't trying to be funny, and I didn't know what was so funny about it. I thought it was a good guess. Maybe I freely said an obvious but previously unspoken truth so suddenly and unexpectedly that it was funny? The answer was stocks apparently. So the time I've made people laugh the most in my whole life, was by accident, when I was being serious. That's a pretty autistic experience."
"Decided after watching the crocodile hunter when I was a kid that I liked nature. Over two decades later and the Hyperfocus has turned it into the center of my professional aspirations, hobbies, and overall personality lol"
"Late in my working life I decided to increase my education and get a Steam Fitter Ticket.

I was in math class near the front and not paying as much attention to the Pythagorean Theorem as the teacher would have liked.

He singled me out to the class and asked me if I knew anything about the Theorem.

I said, ""Are you referring to the 47 problem from the first book of Euclid???"".

He was silent for a moment, then said ""I should have known better than to ask you"".

We got along very well after that."
Somebody once asked me what my ''model'' was (we use the word model to refer to birthyear over here) and I kept being confused thinking they were asking if I was some kind of fashion model (there were no telltale signs that I was) for about a minute before my brain realized. I had heard and understood the word correctly multiple times before.
"On the first day of my senior year in high school I was in my financial literacy class, and I was rocking (which for me just means I'm content/interested) and my teacher asked me multiple times if I was okay, and even went to my IEP coordinator to ask if something was wrong. I feel like that was a complete overreaction, but I guess she meant well?"
"I'm not sure if this is an autistic thing but sometimes when I say something or think something it will remind me of a phrase/song/whatever from a TV Show or Movie and it doesn't matter if I haven't seen the TV Show or Movie in years. My friend says it's very cool that I can do that but I just think it's a bit annoying, especially when I know the line but I can't remember where it's from."
"Touching people and being touched. Also, loose hairs, especially wet ones. Ugh."
"This is a different one: 

Inappropriate dressing, 

Dressing incorrectly for weather , either over or under dressing! My evaluator asked me this and I had no clue it was a ASD thing !!!

I type this as it’s 3 degrees Celsius and I’m wearing my normal uniform , no jacket or warm clothes, and suffering !! WHY I do this all the time"
When me and my boyfriend first got together i cooked some food with french fries as a side. I started counting out each french fry for each plate so we would have the exact same amount. He started laughing and said “why are you counting the french fries?” I thought everybody did that. This was also before my autism diagnosis.
"Idk if this is an autism only experience but waking up in the morning. I don’t understand how people can just shoot up out of bed and start their day. I have very vivid dreams, so it takes me a while to realize I am awake. And once that happens I mentally plan out my day, and figure out the best way to approach a morning routine. Or I sit and try to recreate/finish the dream I had. It’s like I feel paralyzed and can’t get out of bed—even if I have to use the bathroom—until this is done."
keeping friends and trying to understand how the f.... people around me get gf and bfs so easily whilst I find it very overwhelming and cannot understand how they meet where etc. It's weird
 I ask a lot of questions - inquire about everything and am verbose in general. I tend to either wildly overshare (resisting the urge currently) or clam up completely. I used to get hassled about the question thing by peers teachers and coworkers alike.
"At the time I didn't know it was an autistic experience but in kindergarten or first grade this girl wanted to play house with me and the play area was entirely of plastic. I was the husband (i'm a female and it made me uncomfortable) and she was the wife that cooked the plastic dinner in the plastic microwave and handed it to me to eat. I looked her directly in the eye and was like ""This is plastic."" and she said I had to pretend. The whole thing seemed ridiculous to me even now."
"when i was a kid there were some big tells. for starters, i did everything in my power to wear gaucho pants every single day. they were comfy as hell and i had no interest in wearing anything else. i also refused to wear closed-toe shoes until middle school. 

i would sleep either under my desk or in this big basket for stuffed animals because it was just nice and comfy. my mom was so exasperated but eventually she got me this cool barbie swan lake popup tent that i could sleep in on my bed. 

oh also i wet the bed until i was like 12 🥲"
"That realization that you're not stupid you're just autistic. Like how I can never tell what someone is thinking, along with tons of other things. I thought I was just dumb until I found out."
"I'm working on getting a professional diagnosis ATM, and my boyfriend and I are like, 100000000% sure I have autism (considering my brother (formally sister) has autism, and so does my dad). So, I was watching a video, and it was about what not to do when you visit the USA, it was on Lav Luka's channel (reacting to the vid), and, the guy was like ""do NOT tell people how're you actually doing if they ask ""how are you"""", and I was like, without skipping a beat, ""Wait, what? You're not supposed to tell people? Why do they ask then?""

My boyfriend looked over to me and was like, ""uhhh... what?""

Yeah. No. I didn't realize it. It's just an idiom. I didn't realize that."

"I have been learning about herbal tea/tisanes etc. for about a year. I have a blend of iced hibiscus/elderberry/rose tea in the fridge that is good. But this morning I was dealing with stuff and my brain went “I only will accept Coke, ginger ale, and you can try the cherry juice blend if you’re feeling lucky. Tried telling that brain section the benefits of the herbs and that I have enjoyed the rest of the quart of it. Took another swalllow. Striking brain area pulls “if you continue I’ll go for nausea, here’s a preview”"
"I’m autistic and parenting my child who I highly suspect is autistic as well. He is a lovely goofball and such an amazing kiddo. His favorite thing to do during playtime is to create patterns with his toys. I.e. arranging his cars in a very meticulous order. I love to watch him as he plays. I often wonder what he’s thinking about as he plays. Like, “why the red car adjacent to the blue car” vibes for certain."
"I doubt this is only an autistic thing but I think it's probably autism related. I hate being asked ""how are you?"", especially when I'm doing badly. It takes too much energy to say everything that's going on and they just want ""fine"" or ""good"" anyways like it doesn't mean anything. I've taken to answering ""I'm here"" which tends to get confusion but a willingness to move on. Sometimes people laugh and sometimes they look displeased but it keeps me from totally crumbling apart."
I once tried to say a small comment for ten minutes and I got interrupted every. Single. Time.
Getting locked in the school’s isolation room because they didn’t want to accommodate me
Learning this is autism has made me feel a lot better about myself. It would be nice to be able to keep friends but now I’m not so hard on myself for not being able to
It used to happen to me a lot in school or when I was little. :(
"I've been somewhat obsessed with the process of making and keeping friends for the last year or so, and have figured out a lot of why I'd always find it so difficult, and think a lot of other autistic people can relate. Basically, there's different levels of ""friendship"" people have, and this is rarely communicated, and something I'd often struggle to understand. I'd put friends into three ""levels"", and the goal of maintaining a friendship is to identify the level of friendship you are at/want to have with someone, and ensuring that they have the same goals, and then putting in work to maintain the friendship. 

To start with the levels, from what I've seen most friendships will be either acquaintances (you know each others names, will say hi if you see one another, may encounter each other in group activities, but do not deliberately plan to spend time together), proximity friends (a closer friendship, you plan and do activities together, but the friendship is usually focussed on one activity or setting, such as being classmates or doing the same hobby) and best friends (you do multiple different activities together, regularly communicate in person/thru text and are both comfortable being very open/honest with each other if needed). The biggest issue I've had making friends throughout my life, and why I'd often lose friends unexpectedly, was that I'd often see my proximity friends as best friends, whereas they only saw me as a proximity friend. I think a lot of this has to do with how intensely I focus on interests, so to me doing the same activity with someone twice a week means we're best friends, but having never expanded the friendship beyond this activity, once it ends the friendship quickly dies out. This aligns with how I'd often seem to lose most of my friends during transitional periods in my life, despite making some efforts to maintain contact. Similarly, I am awful at memorizing faces and names, and so keeping acquaintances with people is very hard for me, and seems to be almost automatic for neurotypicals. During university I barely knew the names of anyone I'd have classes with, and this made it progressively harder to befriend people as I went into upper years, and me avoiding people or not knowing who they were would be seen as rude rather than genuinely not knowing.

So how do I go about maintaining friends now. First of all, I've accepted the fact that having a bunch of acquaintances is a lot of work for me, and doesn't provide much benefit. I've stopped worrying as much about this type of friendship, and beyond my immediate coworkers I care a lot less about superficially ""knowing"" the people I see day to day. Similarly, I've gotten a lot better at identifying whether the people I spend time with are proximity friends or best friends. This mostly comes down to seeing the variety of activities we do, for example someone I know from a hobby group is inviting me to have dinner with them is a sign of a higher level of friendship. Similarly, the level of comfort with more ""difficult"" topics is another good metric. Proximity friends will often be supportive, but somewhat reserved and uncomfortable dealing with harder topics, or won't know you well enough to offer much input (this can also just be a result of personal comfort levels with these topics, so not a 100% success test. ) I've also been working on intentionally working to transition proximity friends into best friends, who I'll maintain contact with even outside of the activity through which we first met. This takes a level of effort, which needs to be reciprocated by both parties. Personally I hate texting, and the daily texting a lot of people do is very stressful and draining for me, so I don't do it much, but it often does help reinforce a friendship. What I will do is often put in effort to invite proximity friends to other activities together, and try to establish a connection outside of the initial activity we met through. After doing this a few times, see how much the other person reciprocates, if they begin also asking you to do things with them, and generally being more open around you, it means the friendship is developing more. Failure to do this, and general reliance on only one mutual activity for much of my life is the reason many of my past friendships would fall apart. 

Also, keep in mind friendships require effort, and there are a limited amount that anyone can maintain. Although I've found maintaining friends takes less effort than making new ones, I still have a limited capacity, and have needed to accept I will never have the breadth of friends that an extroverted NT does. This doesn't bother me, and keeping more realistic expectations has made me enjoy my friendships more, and prevented me from going into social burnout, which usually has me going no contact with everyone I know for a week. Maintenance is stuff like regularly talking to someone, planning to spend time together, and helping one another when needed/able. It should feel like *work*, but it is effort, and it's easy to disregard only to realize that a friendship has began dissolving. 

Hope this helps, it's worked for me so far and I actually have a decent social life for the first time in years"
"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time"
"This ! 

I don’t know if I’ve just managed to find consistently shitty people , or if I push them away subconsciously with my autism. But it sucks, you finally think someone’s gonna be a good friend then off they go"
"lol same. I was called weird and annoying and bossy and such and I just identified with it and thought nothing of it lol. I’d literally tell people I was annoying, knowing what it meant, but having zero idea it was negative"
Lol same. This is how I realized I should get assessed
"Yeah I still don't even know if it was bullying, but my ""friends"" in high school would make fun of me a lot, especially related to social difficulties I had. For example they'd regularly point out things I did that were awkward, or try to put me into social situations I didn't want to. The thing was I was so desperate for attention/friends I was happy to have them acknowledge me, and laughed along even though I was super uncomfortable with these encounters. The thing is though even then I did want to call them out, but didn't have other friends and didn't know if I could even make them, so I put up with the occassional teasing/jokes at my expense to have some semblance of friends. Eventually, they just kinda stopped talking to me altogether, or at least excluded me from a good amount of activities and I realized that I really wasn't part of this group. Led a months long depressive spiral, but after that was done i met other people and was shocked at how *nice* they were to me, and would try to help me when I made social mistakes rather than laugh at it. I'm way less tolerant of people being rude now, but still have a lot of insecurities related to how I was bullied, and feel like I'm being judged all the time when I make a social mistake."
This!! This so much
"Language problems in general are an under talked about part of autism. 

Autistic people will often not be aware of the connotative meaning of what they or others are saying and it leads to a lot of miscommunication, self advocacy issues, relationship (romantic and platonic) issues. 

A lot of what we say has a hidden meaning. Before reading mental health social media, I thought saying “I’m so lazy” was a way to say “I don’t have much energy and I don’t feel like doing anything”. Thing is, people don’t respond to those 2 the same way. So I was trying to say “I don’t have much energy and I don’t feel like doing anything” and people were responding with “don’t be so hard on yourself” (OK? But I actually want this resolved, not to just not be hard on myself) or “you don’t need to be lazy, you’re just choosing to” (I low key believed this and would constantly try new diets, plans, etc. but they’d never stick because I had low energy and severe organizational problems). Had I expressed this differently, I’d probably have gotten better advice. It’s likely many other autistics are in a similar situation right now and I wish more was talked about when it comes to language/syntax issues, as I think this is really the core to a lot of the problems autistics face"
*existence feels so insanely wrong*
"i relate, currently laying on my stumach with my feet up on an office chair"
Takes about three seconds for the abacus operators to manually tally and translate their English words into whatever pictograph language my brain uses for internal communication lol
"My brother does this a lot, and I only recently found out that he was autistic. Thinking about it now, and the fact that both of us did that growing up, yeah..."
"This is also an adhd thing, more specifically it is auditory processing issues"
"My nickname in high school was “huh?”
People thought it was funny. I did too a few seconds later."
And then saying “what?” again because I saw the words your mouth made but there’s ancillary noise going on so I couldn’t quite hear you. Then just nodding and laughing a bit to stop the awkwardness
This usually happens with me when I don’t hear them that well. It takes me a minute to try to connect the sounds and lip movements to words in a sentence that make sense.
Yea I  struggle with this soo soo much!
This isn’t an autism thing apparently. More like an adhd thing
"This is me all the time, and I honestly don't know how to not do it. I'll often say what/pardon after someone talks then a second later I've caught up mentally and am able to respond. It's annoying, but also it's super common among autistic people (at least those I'm friends with) to the point we all kinda know to wait a second or 2 after being asked to repeat something."
I think this is just a human thing.
I don't really think that has anything to do with autism if I'm being honest
"I have a whole ass talk show (think First Take on ESPN) to myself every. single. fucking. day.

And I love it. The best part is it can be entirely improvised, because it's just me and three clones of me.

Sock puppets on my hands always go to the phones.

Hell, I even have ""celebrity guests"" which, *you guessed it,* are just me doing shitty impressions of their voices.

*The One-Man Roundtable,* coming this fall to nowhere."
"Sometime talking out loud let's me ""hear"" my thoughts, because the surrounding noises drown out the ""thought voice""."
LITERALLY I be talkin to my cohost (me/whoever im interviewing in my head senario) in our little podcast but its just me babbling and giggling to myself looking insane if anyone saw me
Omg SAME! I talk to myself quite frequently!
My first thought: Isn't that something everyone does?
Everybody should talk out loud with themselves more. It’s weird having to do it in my head. That way you also always have a intelligent conversation.
Same here 🥲
"I love talking to myself, sometimes I act like I am someone else I’m talking to. I’m like “that wasn’t very smart” and then my other part will say “no it was fine, cause…”"
"I do this all the time. It confuses people I work with. I work from home and have to communicate with colleagues over Teams, and there'll often be a three way conversation going on between me, my colleague and me. Constantly having to say, 'sorry, I was talking to myself then, not you.'"
I think out loud but I don’t know if it’s the same thing. I find it impossible to think internally.
I thought it was just me. I love talking to myself! (Mostly because I'm the only one who listens the majority of the time)
Yh I also talk to myself and everyone else are wondering who I'm talking to
"I’m this, but to my cat. And always the same types of phrases and expressions."
I talk to myself as if I have a literal other varient of myself for each though I get 😂
"This. And I think I got worse during the pandemic because I got used to not being around people all the time or people not seeing me mutter to myself because I was wearing a mask. 

Also singing about what I'm doing, which I also do more now."
I’ll recite an entire story of a scenario I was involved in to absolutely no one just because. Just randomly. I’ll be watching tv and all the sudden my brain will go “remember that time you ____” and I’ll tell the whole story out loud as if anyone is listening 😂
"Kinda related but more a form of echolalia, typing out comments/messages like this one, having a whole assed internal discussion about it, then after hitting send - reading the message like 5 times again and then having another internal discussion."
Yep this. Wether it's out loud or in my head I'm constantly talking to myself. I've had to catch myself while on the phone with my husband because I'll branch off into a personal conversation with myself. My siblings love it because I'm funny. Other people look at me like I have multiple heads. I was frequently told its ok to talk to yourself as long as you don't answer yourself. How does one talk to themselves without answering? I will never know.
yeah i feared i was a sociopath until i realised i am autistic with alexithymia. Dont know how i feel most the time and when i should feel good (sunny day walking in the park etc) i dont feel anything. Only emotions i can identify are anxiety and sometimes just vague 'good' when its friday or something
"Allistic people can have alexithymia, but for different reasons - I’m autistic and don’t have much of it, but my husband has ComplexPTSD due to childhood events and he’s strongly affected by alexithymia. He’s in therapy and is making slow progress thankfully.   Even his therapist at first thought he couldn’t have alexithymia and that it was only associated with autism but we researched and found out it’s an end result that can have different causes. I don’t think that’s at all well known though, and obviously the prevalence among autistic people is vastly higher than among allistic people. Most people with alexithymia would be autistic. As far as I know, CPTSD can cause a number of things that present as similar to autism, and my husband is very similar to a high-masking autistic person but doesn’t feel that he’s autistic. And a lot of people with autism also have CPTSD so that makes it even more complicated!"
"I wonder if a lot of autistics have a language issue that is misinterpreted as alexithymia.

Like maybe they know what they’re feeling but don’t know a communicative way to actually express it."
"I'm absolutely the opposite, I feel too much, like toooo much, and I'm a very overthinking person so that doesn't help. 
I've read some info about alexithymia I'll try and read more!"
"One of the first things I can think of reflecting on that wasn't normal for everyone was how I couldn't explain how I felt, physically or emotionally. I would go to the school nurse in elementary school saying I was feeling sick, but my temperature would be fine all the time.

I think sometimes people have issues describing complex emotions, but I feel like all those times I went to the doctor or talked to my parents I should've said something, anything, about my physical or emotional well-being. For example, I know I have anxiety now, but it's still only lists of things that can help me identify emotions like that."
god i relate sm
"Okay, I’ll raise you one. Listening to music no one has ever heard of, and then trying to talk to people about it.

Alternatively, listening to super nerdy music that makes you embarrassed to bring it up. EG, video game music. Yes, I listen to Mario music, have you listened to the Odyssey soundtrack?"
what music do you listen to???
"My current hyperfixation is Hamilton but since I’m from the uk literally nobody I know irl is interested in hearing about it, and I’ve been watching it on repeat and listening to the songs every day for over a month now"
Girl In Red for me just now ♥️ 😭
"Our brutal honesty here shows tbh I can't stand them when they do this just for ""casual conversation"""
I genuinely cannot imagine telling someone I'm not listening to them or I'm not interested in what they're saying unless they are genuinely being an a\*\*hole. The idea of offending someone like that/hurting their feelings like that is literally mortifying to me. Maybe it's the people pleaser in me.
"Yeah this one. Especially if I'm somewhere I didn't want to be but had to out of obligation (family and in laws) I used to ask my husband if he could bring a dummy of me because they were never interested in letting me speak anyways and the multiple conversations and audio processing issues made everything torture already.... Yet everything I didn't go to, they'd make a big deal out of"
This one hits home way too hard
"Or they /are/ listening, but they're always trying to find some hidden meaning in your tone or body language instead of just hearing the words coming out of your mouth.  Always some puzzle having conversations"
"learning that im allowed to say ""sorry im not really listening"" changed my life"
"I genuinely thought I might be one! Now reading that other people had the same thought, is a pretty awesome feeling"
I feel like an alien even as an adult lol
"God I relate to this. 

I am terrible in team games;  I recall I used to get super overwhelmed and confused.  In school we used to have this game called The Invasion Game which was supposed to be a fun game on rainy days but I hated it with a passion; you had to be on two opposing teams and you had to get to the other end of the hall, and if you got caught you ended up in the other team’s “jail” - it was absolutely baffling to me, and I remember always getting caught.

I was good at things like badminton and the gym class with things like spinning, and also cricket, but most everything else was hellish."
"Please explain your pov cause I think, SAME. 

For me it could be, the time of the classes, (if it was winter it was too cold, and if it was summer it was waaaay too hot. And the feeling of (me thinking) that people was paying attention to me (ig social anxiety?)"
"Feeling so exposed and vulnerable and VISIBLE. plus change rooms.

Edit: and getting picked last."
"Never knew the rules of what we were playing, what I was supposed to do when it was my turn, everyone on my team yelling at me what to do *at once*, not to mention just being bullied in gym classes. Tbh I understand like, health-wise, why gym class is still a
thing, but in terms of student mental health I think it should be at least optional, or you could opt for independent exercise instead of team games. Even in regular media like TV shows and movies, gym class is always shown to be a borderline traumatic experience for any ""underdogs"" in the class and involves a lot of basically hiding from other students. It's a stereotypical and cliché portrayal of american high schools but it's also not far from reality for a lot of us. On TV they just play it off like hiding from verbal or physical abuse during the school day is a natural consequence of being uncool and not much to be done about it. I had to have my dad help me convince the principal to let me opt-out of gym class sophomore/junior year (I can't remember) because I was being bullied, one specific kid would come up behind me and scream in my ears, or laugh as hard as he could at me any time I messed up in class. 

I think it's also just a lot to expect teenagers going through puberty to be comfortable getting naked or almost naked in front of their peers. Our locker rooms had some stalls but when it came to swimming, it took much longer to change out of swimsuits and if you stood around too long waiting for someone to leave the stall you'd be late for class. I feel like making gym class 100% mandatory save for kids with physical disabilities (and even then some of them are accused of exaggerating and still expected to participate) is not taking into consideration all the needs of the students."
"this just made me realize that I probably have karma from being a bully for two years in my elementary school days (because, ATT, I was ""one of the boys"", and then I moved, and I became ""the weird one"").

But yeah, I feel this one. Also, I guess I deserved what happened to me, like, I'm accepting that as my punishment from the universe."
nooooo I'm so sorry for you 😤 but also you gotta take care (specially on the weather!) And I hope you probably found more favourite things to wear! 🩷
"Literally. I went back to in person school in 2021 when distance learning ended, and I wore the same sweater to school every single day for the next two years until I graduated. Even wore it to the “graduates walk” at my old elementary school instead of a cap and gown. My mom was so mad at me, but it’s crazy how much easier it is to go through the insanity of day to day living when you have something constant to hold onto."
Me with my safe pyjamas that are falling apart (literally) but I refuse to chuck them out Ha
Yes. This was me everyday when I went to school lol
"I also hate transitions. My parents used to beg and plead for me to get into the bath. Once I was in the bath, they’d beg for hours to get me out of the bath. The process would start all over again when it was time for me to go to bed. And surprise surprise, getting me out of bed in the morning to go to school was another battle. I never understood why when I was a kid. Only as an adult do I know know why. I hated getting in the bath because the temperature change and wet feeling was so different and I found it overwhelming. Once I got used to being in the tub, it was fine but then getting out of the bath would make me cold and that was overwhelming again. I just don’t adjust well to new stimulus. I like it when it’s constant."
Question: is this something you learned as you got older og grew out of? Asking cus my son (5) has similar response to leaving the house.
"I'm similar. I wear slip on shoes almost exclusively because it takes me so long to tie shoes. I was a nightmare to get out of bed as a child and I was terrible at getting ready on time for anything. I still struggle a lot with time management. Transitions are really hard for me. I almost always sit in the car for a while after I get home from anything, I'll sit there anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes."
"Your wrong my friend, I prefer sweat pants and a hoodie and I go long for looking for the ones that fit good AND pop put. 

Best advice is to have no rush looking for good clothes, they appear like sent from heaven."
I feel SEEN
Or see a bus when I'm at a set of lights.
"And police, paramedics, and fire department"
"Same. I just don't buy clothes with tags anymore now. But I still wear my socks inside out. It doesn't help much, because I can still feel the seams, but it feels not as bad."
The flip side being avoiding all eye contact altogether.
Hang on. What is ‘proper’ eye contact then?
The pees I RELATE SO MUCH 😭😭😭 when you feel you hair falling in a uncomfortable place or the sound of yourself breathing 🥲 and if I wear cancelling noise earplugs is just so uncomfortable
and then everyone assumes you’re angry :(
"im the same for number 2, i never played an m rated game untill i played persona 5, and when i asked if i can get it my parents did not care. also i avoided r rated films like the plague and the first thing i do when watching a film is check the age rating."
that’s so cute!
Accidentally stepping on something wet or sticky is oh noo like I won't be good or even okay until it's fixed
Yeah
"""do you not even want something to drink?"" No I'm good (while really hungry, thirsty and max anxiety)"
SAME
"All sports or just sports where two teams compete to move an object to a goal?

I can enjoy participating in sports like powerlifting, cycling, climbing, team speed skating, team rowing…"
How!? Why?! Me myself avoid crowded buses as it is but why would they avoid you??? 😤
"Same but like, your own rules and patterns that makes sense....only to you HAHA"
"That last one, I took the exact same role because 'oh more money, maybe I can do this' OMG no, never again. And yeah now just a standard dev with the same wage."
"The first one happens to me a lot which was hard to relate with some other autistics because I read they had their special interest for a long time while me, is like:
I like this one thing, I start to get interested, I NEED to know MOST things I can about this thing, and I NEED TO talk about this to other people and then suddenly the interest disappears 😭 
And with last one, I'm glad you could find a better way, I had to quit my first 2 jobs and start working from home (by myself) cause I can't stand people."
i was the opposite - very naïve and afraid to say no to people. i hate making people upset :\
"Same here with cereal. It just gets so soggy so quickly!
And my favorite childhood go-to movie was Porco Rosso. The public library happened to have a copy so I’d rent it out at least once a month lmao"
"When I was about the same age I did the same thing with The Little Mermaid! My mom still can’t watch the movie because of how sick of it she got from hearing it play over and over again when I was little. A few years ago (well I guess like eight years ago at this point) I actually did it again, but with Phineas and Ferb: Across the Second Dimension"
I'm the same way with cereal
"HAHAHAHA THE DOGS!! I love this 😭🫶🏻 but the vocal tics is a autistic thing fr? Again, I thought everyone do it 😓"
Same but with culinary jobs. I can't walk into a restaurant kitchen anymore 🥲 I also was mistreated so badly. My boyfriend says it's because I didn't have much luck and they were my first 2 jobs but I'm pretty sure Its not for me working like that
"Omg this!!! I was forced to “be brave” as a kid and order something or go in and get something to “fix my anxiety” 

…… me with my ASD Dx now and screaming traits from childhood ….. that ain’t gonna work ….. thanks y’all"
"Hiii, I'm new here too 🥰 can't believe everyone telling me their experiences, you are so helpful! 
Please, don't hate yourself, if they don't understand, that's society's problem, not yours! 
I also hate bras and I got interested in your brain going to weird directions, could you explain if you don't mind? I think I could relate haha"
Also having a meltdown in front of the 40-50 people in my chemistry lab because I couldn’t concentrate with so many people talking. Bad memories rip
"If u don't mind, could you tell me some stimming of yours? I still have very much doubts with stimmings in general"
Or realising as a late diagnosed that all those “movements” were actually just stims……
I'm so sorry for this
"Or better yet , us being terrible at reading people, but amazing at telling the soon as someone realises we are different/ASD ……"
"same, I really try hard to vote well, and to understand history of my country for example but is soooo extensive and there are parts I don't get. I also have very complex opinions on social issues which can lead to arguments when people don't wanna debate in a good way."
"Hi, if you wanna learn more about how to engage with these topics I suggest listening to black autistic people. It might be a little easier to understand the nuances of these topics from us. I didn’t want to have to clarify this but this does seem to be an issue sometimes on this subreddit where people do end up using their autism as an “excuse”. The reason it comes off this way is because if someone says you’ve said something racist and your first response is “sorry, …” nothing should come after the sorry pertaining to your background. Whether your autism was the cause of this or not doesn’t matter when it comes to racism because despite what your intentions, the outcome still negatively impacts us, even if it’s just socially. I’d much rather just have a sincere apology and then a promise that you’ll try to work on improving. 

Also, saying “nothing about you is racist” feels dismissive to us because when you’ve grown up in a system that is specifically meant to benefit you, that’s kind of impossible. Even you said it yourself that you grew up with certain sentiments that you’ve had to unlearn. That’s true of all white people, not just white autistics. Saying these misunderstanding are caused only by autism feels as if you only care about defending yourself.

And for the other thing, the reason you can still be racist even while having black friends is because just because we are your friends doesn’t mean we’re always comfortable with you. Sometimes we believe there’s genuinely good people who just need to be educated but we’re to scared to say anything because they tend to have that exact reaction and get defensive. There’s a power dynamic there that we’re constantly aware of. Especially if we’re black and autistic since social cues are already so hard."
"Ugh yeah totally get you, I'd have done the same lol"
"I know, my best coping mechanism is to prepare mentally in everything and everyone. Has been my best tool, but when it doesn't depends on you is so hard to do it at the moment :("
My biggest issue at school!
"Thats awful, they shouldn't judge by how you look or talk, but your work and professionalism! If u are openly autistic you can maybe clarify, that's why youre like that, even tho I understand people don't listen or dont care, sadly.

And now you made me wonder what a baby knows about it 🧐 do they like wearing it? do they know the categories of hats?"
"I do experience the need of being alone, or at least, with a person that I'm very comfortable with. Even my boyfriend (I live with him) has to insist to me on hanging out with my friends because I don't really feel like leaving the house as comfortable as it is
And the last thing, YESSS it was my biggest issue at school 😭 I would FIGHT and argue anyone who will be talking while the teacher's explaining 😭😭😭 that's why maybe no one talked to me, also my sense of justice; there is a professional standing, who is trying to teach you what you need to learn, but you are talking????? The disrespect 🥲"
"Same and it is hell at work with this... I quit for many reasons but this was one of them, even the people I used to work with didn't like me to ASK ???"
"omg it was JUST THERE.
Pretty similar I've always thought it was just depression, but this year I have a few social issues that overwhelmed me so much, which I couldn't understand why
Then, looking for an answer, I've started to research wondering ""why am I like this???""...and then, all the answers lead me to, here. 

I'm 19 and, obsessed with all this information I looked for a professional and a diagnosis but they ARE expensive. And I've found this community which is awesome and I already appreciate so much. I feel SO identified but personally, don't wanna rely on self diagnosis, so I'm hoping at the end of the year I would be looking into paying the tests...

Now, talking about my family, my little brother is the only one that could be too but we can't know, we have a very dysfunctional family haha"
"Don't worry I'm not an English speaker either!

And I don't see the joke fr HAHAH"
"Exactly, i guess they were trying not to say it and you say it so freely that it was weird? I don't even know either HAHAH"
The wet hair just got a goosebump all over my body
"This but with executive dysfunction. A few days ago I found out that habits are things you don't have to think

WDYMMM everyone doesn't think and think about waking up and the day when they ARE waking up???? it is so hard for me and I can have 100 alarms and wake up at the 99"
When ppl ask me why do I want a diagnosis my best answer is always to know that isn't just that I choose to be like this and all that shit I've been through is for a reason.
"Yeah, I learned that one about a year ago at the age of 45 lol. Until that point if anyone said “how’s it going?” I would have to pause to formulate a response then say it out loud, but usually they just kept going and are now too far to hear me and either keep going or ask “what?” and then more awkwardness follows. Turns out when someone says “How’s it going?” It’s basically like saying Hi. They just want you to nod and say Hi back. Weirdos."
"Ugh, yes, I hate this one. I now use a scripted response of “Doing well, how are you?”

It also took me years to realize that people are all just as miserable as I am, but they all just pretend that everything is good. I have been able to keep a lot more friends since joining this mass game of pretend. NTs are nuts, man."
What??? That means you stopped liking it?
This is so pretty 🥹 that you probably gonna get to understand each other and be supportive 🫶🏻 hope he have a good life ✨✨
"Im so sorry that they did this to you, you didn't deserve it."
This is very helpful!
"Wow. You put it into words. This is amazing, thank you"
"I've had the same special interest for a couple years now and have kept logs on my ""research"" (social experiments or just observational science) in my journal, to the point where I have 5 pages dedicated to the levels of friendship, and the art of making and keeping friends. I won't bore you with the entire transcript.
        
        For me, there is 6 levels of friendship, and you are always exactly at one level, it is not gradual, you jump straight from one level to the next; or sometimes skip certain levels when the time is right. First level, acquaintance, you see each other about, usually in one setting, you'll say hi, but you're not ""friends"" per se. Second level, this is where you'll see each other more often than acquaintances, so you've built sort of a rapport, but you're still not really friends, it just happens that you maybe have a few classes together or pass each other a few times a day and may walk together. Level 3, this is where I classify a person as a ""friend"". This level is where you talk to the person on purpose, you find enjoyment in talking to them or otherwise seek them out, you don't consider them your best friend but you'll seek them out on occasion. Level 4, this is the baseline friend level, you're friends with them, when referring to them you say ""my friend"", you hang out with them, you talk to them regularly. Level 5, this is your best friend(s), you love being around these people, they are your circle, they are your support system, these people are truly bonded with you. Level 6 is where a romantic relationship starts, crush level, you adore this person and want to be in a romantic relationship with them, I have a whole other 6 levels of dating, and 4 levels of marriage, but that's for another day.

        Making friends is an art, as is keeping them. The steps of making friends obviously go hand in hand with the levels of friendship. For me, I start with an acquaintance. If this acquaintance is someone I think is cool and will want to be friends with, I engage in a conversation with them, an ""interview"" if you will. I do it slyly, slip little (more important than regular everyday questions) questions into conversation; sometimes even questions phrased as statements. ""Yeah, I identify with pansexuality."" (Are you homophobic?) ""What kind of music do you like?"" (Do you like country?(I hate country and it's listeners are usually xenophobic, though not generalizing.)) ""What is your favorite movie?"" (Whatever you say, don't say the notebook.) Anyways, after my little interview I decide if I'd like to talk to them more or not, if I like them and we vibe, I gradually talk to them more, usually this is how it goes: upping to a conversation every 2-3 days for about 3 weeks; a conversation every day for about a month (this stage I get their socials, phone number, basically a digital contact method); then I'll start hanging out with them, going places with them, etc in a group, I do it strictly in a group for anywhere from a month to 3 months, depending on how comfortable we both are; finally, I'll start hanging out with them one-on-one, first outside houses, and then possibly inside one of our houses. Usually, I move through these stages to a certain point, and then re-evaluate if they are worth my time. If I decide they are, I will move up, if they're kinda in the middle, I keep them where they are, if they're not, I gradually move them down the levels, and will leave them a polite message saying something along the lines of ""I'm sorry, I don't feel we should talk anymore, it's nothing you did (unless it is), I just don't feel the vibe with you anymore."" Keeping friends for me is very exhausting and if a person doesn't bring me joy, or I can't bring them joy, or we just can't vibe in general, it's pointless for me to continue to be their friend. I try to be as polite about it as possible, though I come off as callous occasionally. This is why I have like 2 friends at level 4, 1 at 5, and a boyfriend.

EDIT: Not exactly sure why it put the latter 2 paragraphs in a code block, but whatever."
"All I know

"I'm able to make friends with *everyone* but esp the ""weird and annoying"" people and everyone thought it was weird that I could get along w such ppl...until I realized some of my favorite ""weird and annoying ppl"" were autistic...and then I finally understood the obvious"
Yes! Exactly
"A few I got called: weird x1000, serial killer (sometimes a specific one if I was ""lucky"" enough, smiley (as in you never smile)."
I am low key jealous that you can do that
Explains everything.
It's really interesting to talk to people who are just like... instant responders. Like you say something and they're basically replying half a second before you've even finished. Would be nice to be able to process things that quickly.
"Oh lord I have the talk show also, only I hate it lol. This made me show myself some more appreciation. Whats your decor like? Mines old timey, like the one in The Joker"
I think I’d do severe damage to myself if I had Stephen A Smith’s voice going through my head all day
"I guess something similar to that is I do maladaptive daydreaming and I ACT out scenes, if I don't have music I do talk to myself too hahaha"
"Urgh yeah, I went years not knowing and thought I was a sociopath, just turns out I struggled with identifying my emotions. Like a funeral of someone I truly loved and missed and not being able to grieve. Also I struggle to identify physical pain location a lot.

I am the opposite now tho, as I feel my emotions deeply and I'm like an emotional sponge 😞"
"That sounds more like depression. I was in some presentation thing once, and the woman was talking about depression. She said ""if you think about the things you felt over the last few weeks, you should have a full range of feelings, not just.... angry or tired"".

And I realised those are the feelings I most readily could identify. All other feelings/emotions were extremely muted."
"I feel too much and have alexithymia. They’re not mutually exclusive. 

I have trouble identifying, naming, understanding my emotions, and also interpreting emotions in other people. I can detect something is off like a spidey sense but it’ll drive me crazy trying to decode what it means…

And I very very often get overwhelmed by other people’s emotions (and my own).

But sometimes I seek out humans on purpose to soak in their human essence…

ETA: when people ask me “how do you feel?” I always respond with “I’m thirsty” “I’m cold” etc. because body sensations are faster for me to interpret.."
"I feel that completely lol. I really love the soundtrack from Crypt of the Necrodancer. It might be one of the best video game soundtracks but NOBODY knows about it lol. Odyssey does have some good stuff.

My favorite musician is Will Wood also which most people haven't ever listened to. A lot of his music is about how hard it can be to understand yourself and be happy with who you are, which not everyone relates to as much as me."
"Oh what don't I listen to? Lol

My favorite stuff to listen to is probably Will Wood, Nirvana, Lemon Demon, and a lot of classic rock songs.

But I like just about anything except modern country music, Christian rock (nothing against Christians, I just personally find the music not super interesting), and really harsh metal music."
"Ive been wanting to watch Hamilton since a while!! And I was sad because I went to like a ""party"" musical inspired and I couldn't sing Hamilton's masterpieces"
"I'll be honest, I haven't listened to Hamilton but I'll definitely check it out. I really like musicals. Little shop of horrors, Nightmare before Christmas, and Jekyll and Hyde are ones I really like."
"i spent so much time trying to be normal and wondering why i wasn’t fitting in. i felt like even at my hardest, people could still tell i wasn’t like them. i was so scared to be different and i didn’t understand what i was doing wrong. i still don’t"
yeah but at least now we know why!
the teacher would get mad at me for not being  able to do things right and the kids would laugh at me 😭
yes!! the opting for independent exercise needs to become a thing it would be so helpful
"I don't know how but NT seem to feel our vibes idk how or why.
And I empathize with what happened but if now you are conscious about it, maybe you could forgive yourself and ask for forgiveness too 🩷🫶🏻"
i did! the next was a black hoodie (lol) that i wore every day. then that got too small and it was a bright orange hoodie. i’m now a lot better about not wearing the same thing every day but i will wear the same social distortion shirt that i got from hot topic several days a week lol. love that thing
"I'm a heavy sleeper autistic with a single mom. My mom struggled with getting me to school so she would made me wear the schools uniform as a pijama and in the morning she'd carry me to the car asleep, drove me to school and then she'd wake me up when we arrived... It was savage but it did the job. Can't blame her."
"For me, I've learned about this term recently and I was also thinking I have really bad executive dysfunction which makes sense with also struggling with transitions. And I can't say if had it at such a young age but since middle school (maybe 10/13y/o) I've been dealing with this and it suckssss. 

It also depends on your environment as someone said in another reply, my mom wouldn't help me with a good routine. And she would scream at me for going out late, taking my time to leave the house, etc."
"I'm 21, it's not an inkling better. If anything probably worse."
"For me, it helped becoming an adult and having more control over my schedule. Since I’m the one choosing to do things, it makes it somewhat easier. At a young age though, I think visual schedules and 10-minute/5-minute warnings would have helped me (because I was so time-blind). My spouse now helps me a lot with transitions, too, by helping me stick to routines and physically helping me stand up when I’m stuck on the couch, etc."
Maybe this is why I have SO much trouble when I go shopping? 😭 I have to touch and see and try most of the clothes that I like to see if 1. I really like it 2. It is to be comfortable
Huh? Lol
Public transportation gang
"Where do you find clothes without tags, if I can ask? I’m so tired of removing them and still be bothered anyway"
"There's actually a rule for this: make eye contact 50% of the time while talking, and 70% of the time while listening."
"Im not sure but I think its just like looking at their head/places around the eyes, not directly in the eyes for the whole conversation"
Look when you want to? I honestly don't know either.

"Any complex ones, like American football, cricket (that is insanely complex), or any sport like that."

EXACTLY hahahahaha
"Well, I don't like that either, but if they don't specifically ask me to go to the cinema or so, I def won't go if I don't like what they're going to do. Especially if they're doing sth against the rules. That's a no, whether they ask me or not. I learned not to snitch tho. Little me would've."
"Oh my gosh I can’t believe I’ve found another no-milk-with-cereal person! Even most other *autistic* people will never let me live that one down. Thanks, friend"
"I've seen the same movie over and over, it's downloaded in my brain and I can watch it whenever I want. I remember all the lines, what they were wearing, the music, everything"
I did this with monsters inc as soon as it finished i rewound it and played it again 😂
"No idea - but idk anyone non autistic who does it how I do lmao. It's the inclusive ""get 'em"" under my breath, mimicking taylor..."
"Oh, and buying 10 copies of the same stuffed animal in different colors."
This. This is THE worst
"oh wow, i have a lot but my main ones are popping any joints, sliding my thumb over my fingernails, snapping, doing this thing where i have one hand as a fist and i punch my open palm(my favorite), pacing, intense staring, humming, digital art, and much more. even smoking(weed) is a stim, it can become a problem because it's so satisfying to hit a pen or to hit a bong. but trust me, you stim even if you think you dont"
also idk how i forgot these but gaming and music are huge stims. playing a minecraft while listening to a song on repeat is euphoric
"yep. i didn't know that i was constantly stimming, even when i think i'm not i'm doing something like staring really hard or sucking my teeth, clenching my jaw. thought i was just going crazy"
"It’s not just with race, I have problems with any social issue, the reason I say I’m autistic is so people realize I just struggle with social rules and don’t think I’m just being a dick-head.  It got really bad, like I went to a boarding school and people burst into my room there and surrounded me when I came out of the bathroom and made me have a severe mental breakdown.  Like, even if I said something problematic that is definitely not the right way to handle it.  My thing is I’m never coming from a place of hate, I don’t hate anyone based on how they look, that’s wrong, it’s just a misunderstanding."
"Think one of the issues is that I don't or sound ""look autistic"" (or so I'm told) and I prefer not tell people if I can avoid it, so people may think I live my life in a constant state of seethe.

Family gathering for a new baby which I was not at all interested in but family kept 'encouraging' me to talk to it and the only thing I could think of is 'what do you know about hats?'"
"Honestly, there's so much in my family that the only reason it wasn't picked up before is because I'm female, and of course autism didn't exist in girls 20 years ago /s.

But, my dad is autistic, his brother is autistic, both of *his* children are autistic (so my cousins). There's also a couple of cousins and an aunt on my mum's side. Plus, as mentioned, my younger brother is severely autistic, and is also non-verbal, and I'm pretty sure my mum is. Pretty sure my youngest sibling is as well...

When my mum spoke to our GP about it when I was a kid, they just said I was a normal little girl who was shy.

The only reason I was able to seek a diagnosis was because I was able to get an assessment on the NHS, and I was waiting almost a year for it. If I had to pay for it, I'd probably have to wait until I could afford it as I'm currently a university student. This subreddit though has definitely helped me as well though."
Yeah that's probably it
"Yes! I used to obsess over watching morning routine YouTube and ig videos to replicate what they do (especially since I’m a software developer and “hustle culture” is a big thing they like to advertise to newbies), but when actually trying to commit to it i felt like I was doing everything wrong. I wonder if this is a part of issues with transitions, and not being able to transition from the bed to the next part of your day."
"Omg. I work in customer service and customers are like “Hi how are you?” And I go, “I’m doing okay, how are you?” And they never respond and they usually just cut me off and start ordering. It’s so awkward."
"I'm in my early 30s, so, I definitely cried because the amount of times I've been looked at like i had five heads was a lot."
"Yeah, it took me into my 30s to realize this, but only because of that video. I would've went more time not realizing that it was a freaking idiom.

I also say the same thing, ""doing well, hry?"" or I make up something punny, like, ""If this sun is still burning and then world is still turning, I'm doing well!"" 

So stupid."
"It is something that I like, situationally. Like some people like beer but only when in groups (“social drinkers” who just never bother to open that beer in the fridge in a year, say). Dad likes coffee, but only drinks it in certain situations. Some social, and “I will make myself Turkish coffee” which is something of a ritual and happens a few times a year. 

I have no objection to the flavors in the abstract. But when I am *very* aware that my retired service dog is nearing her end, am phone tag with people doing disabled housing, I have a major task due end of day, and my body is 1 big angry pain nerve as far as I can tell, liking the flavors didn’t cut it. I needed a safefood, something so familiar it reads neutral to my brain while still letting some carbs do happy brain chemical stuff. 

I put the rest of the cup of iced tea in the fridge so that if my anxiety med help and I get through the things that have actions to solve, and my brain can accept “I haven’t had this 1,000x but it is still good,” I can drink it then. There’s a quart jar of it in my fridge as well. Hopefully I will be able to drink it often enough when I am not operating too close to the point where stress threatens my speech or has me in a ball on the floor. I did take the sign that I couldn’t drink something I blended the taste of quite carefully as a hint to do a few things to make the day easier"
Well i DID bite from time to time lol

Or being forced to put kids arm bands on in high school swimming as I can't swim. Or not bringing a kit deliberately then them giving you awful kit out storage. Or always getting picked last and being made aware I was a burden.

I know that Hanes makes tagless plain t shirts and underwear
"For me I think it's just not paying attention to that, they do other things while talking and probably they are not thinking if they are doing too much or too little eye contact hahaha 

I only do eye contact with people I feel really comfortable with. Otherwise I could get overwhelmed, at street for ex."
"Don't worry there's probably a ton of people in the same situation hahaha
Also, when the bed sheet is kinda old and you can feel the little tiny balls from the fabric 🥲 or used to went my best friend's house for sleepover and he had the bed full with the ""fluff"" and wouldn't shake the sheet to get rid of it how he can sleep with that???? It was a nightmare"
That's so real of you slippers are the best
"My mum was a big sports person back when she was in school. She was basically an all-rounder and also pushed me to be the same. While I somehow managed to get past being alone on stage and having so many eyes on me, sports was a huge no.

I hated pe classes, but it was fine till 5th grade. The person in charge of pe changed and my became hell after that. I hated the teacher so much I'd skip school altogether when we had pe - which was almost always 3 days a week upto 10th grade. High school ends at with the 10th grade where i live, and grades 11 and 12 are pre-uni courses, so life was much easier after that.

The teacher for some reason did not let up on making me exercise - he'd humiliate me in front of the entire class despite privately asking him to exempt me from the drills. I spoke to my principal, WHO WROTE A LETTER TO HIM ASKING TO EXEMPT ME FROM PE CLASSES, *WHICH HE IGNORED*. I was the fat girl in my class, so maybe that gave him an incentive to act the way he did. There were rumours about him acting inappropriately with girls in high school but I don't know how true they were.

But yeah, this guy made my life hell."
I'm so sorry that happened to you :( I wouldve seated next to you! 🫶🏻🩷

"Idk if this is Disney or me, but I kinda hate repeating too much movies that I like. Like, maybe 2-3 its okay but then in Disney I would watch the same movie every time they wanted to play it !! For example, I loooove princess diaries and I would watch it every time!! 

But as a kid, I would repeat on and on the same Barbie and Barney (Christmas) movies"
"Yes! I'm trying to find out which stims do I have because I don't recognise which are and which aren't, thank you for sharing 💘💘💘"

"You’re right, you didn’t deserve for people to invade your privacy. However, that is not the issue I am discussing right now. It is not my job to educate you but I’d like for you to at least try to understand that race is a whole different thing. Having issues picking up social cues may lead to misunderstandings but that does not mean the sentiment isn’t there. If it was then how do you figure black autistics who struggle with social cues do not end up saying racist things? 

You can be racist without being hateful, it actually happens way more often than you’d think. They’re called micro-aggressions. Unfortunately, if you are not willing to see how intentions do not matter in racists context then I do not want to spend time talking about this further. We’ll just go around in circles."

There’s actually a comedy show here in Norway built around a guy who has himself as a sports commentator to his own life. Pretty hilarious and pretty exhausting
Lmao come on he’s at least an aged Stefán
I believe the prevalence among autistic folks is 50% and then among the general population it’s 10%.
Thanks dude! I'll check them out :)
Kinda like how we know we are different but don't know how or why?
"not a big sports fan (not a sports fan at ALL actuallt), but i did want the ut orange cus i thought the color was pretty. got neon orange instead.

however it may disappoint you to know that my second favorite shirt is a UT shirt i got while touring UTK. i got it in the biggest size so it’s very comfy."
"I'm 19 🥲 I would search, and search, and search and sometimes end up buying something that I'm not very convinced for just because I got tired of my undecided and put me into a bad mood."
"That and Goodfellows. I have white and black undershirts that are tagless, but I know I've bought clothes at Target and never had to worry about tags with any clothing, except maybe pants.

I have a stitch ripper to remove tags if I have to."
"Thank you for your suggestions, I will look into it :)"
"I'm so sorry this happened :( luckily, It ended but I know the feeling. My teachers were pushing me too just because, when I was really depressed at that time and ashame of doing exercise but they didn't really care. I too, ended up skipping classes and here, when you do that, you have to do writing work so I was really okay with just studying sports theory 🤷🏻‍♀️"
no problem. stims are really cool. this post actually made me stim a lot more yesterday 👍
"idk what type of music you like but listen to ""flag is raised"" by bladee and ecco2k. then skip to like kind of middle. ecco's part is euphoric."
"I don’t really get how intent doesn’t matter but I have gotten a lot better, I’m working hard to be a better person.  Like I said before I had to unlearn stuff because it was taught to me incorrectly and I didn’t realize at the time how it was wrong and hateful because I was a naive and sheltered child.  I now am better educated on these things"
And got so far but in the end it doesnt wven matter
Guess I know where I'm moving 😂
Guess I know where I'm moving 😂
"Yeah, kinda the same really"
i grew up in tn and the orange has permanently giving me ptsd. I hate the color so much now. I'm glad it makes someone happy tho lol
"Oh, you just made me realise a trait: not being good at making final decisions. Like in a shop and taking 20m just to decide which candy bar I really want."
"Ah yes, big fan of goodfellows. You can also search online for tagless clothing.

A seam ripper has been my best friend lol. Cutting them off with scissors just leaves a scratchy bit behind"
"I'm sorry that happened to you too.

Also, studying sports theory seems like an absolute waste of time for someone who's got no interest in it."
Yesss that's me omgggg that's us 😭 I hate it hereee. Not only in a shop but everything in my life
"For sure. I got tired of the aftermath of ripped tags lol.

I also invested in one of those fuzzy shavers. Shaved countless shirts because without it I'd end up picking my shirts apart."
"Yeah so I found out as an adult that I was 'extremely bullied' as a child, but because of my social ineptitude, I somehow didn't know this. It was in all my school reports from grade 2-7, my parents had phone calls with the principal about it, and yet I still had no idea. I thought the other students were just pointing out facts about me, and didn't really register it as bullying because to me it was all true, and pointing out a fact wasn't bullying, it was stating the obvious. 

My own social difficulties lead to me being bully-proof."
"As an autistic person, I must concur. This is indeed the autism experience."
"I improved it!

"No, I always wanted to go to birthday parties and never got invited, only a few times. And multiple times, I invited people, and few would come. It was rather sad. ""You're not part of our group. You didn't come to the same kinder as us. You didn't grow up with us in the same school."" The worst kind of bullying is inacceptance of the other and alienation."
"This is a great visual example of something I've been ruminating on lately.  

there were several times as a kid where I would get sent to some kind of therapist and they would always assume like I knew I was being bullied?? Or like I cared about being bullied?? I would tell them I wasn't bullied and that everyone at school likes me and they would get mad at me and say I'm just being a smartass and trying to resist treatment and I would be SO FUCKING CONFUSED!

Like, Dude, I didn't KNOW I WAS BEING BULLIED?!? These people thought I was so miserable because I was a joke to people?? I didn't care about that, I didn't even know!! I thought I was having fun laughing with kids every time they were laughing at me cuz I would start laughing with them and then we're laughing together. 

People did try and tell me they're laughing AT me and just cuz I start laughing doesn't mean that I'm laughing ""with"" them, but that would be the point where I'd go sort of deadpan and explain that I know I'm a freak and there's just no point in trying to defend myself because any resistance gives them the reaction they're seeking.  Which then just starts the lecture on how I shouldn't set myself up for failure like that and I could be normal if I ""try hard enough"". Which basically means spend all the energy I have trying to sit in a room with people who bore the shit out of me as I slowly forget what it even means to be myself."
"“You’re weird”

“Thanks, I know”"
"I was bullied a lot as a kid and that ain't it. Every adult would tell me to ""not care"" but it's hard to not care when a bunch of people are telling you that you're fucking worthless every day."
"“You’re insane!”

Sure I am, what’s your point?"
"How does one respond to the ""you're stupid"" ""you're pathetic"" ""you're ugly"" ""no one likes you"" ""you're annoying"" ""you're a loser"" 

Cus I feel like agreeing with them would probably make you feel sad"
Ok… I’m relating to WAY TOO MANY OF THE POSTS ON THIS SUB. I may want to look into it 😭
"Honestly, yeah, lol

It's pretty hard to hurt my feelings through insults because they're either true or not true about me. If you state a fact about me, I'm like, ""Haha, yeah, that's me"" and if you state something untrue about me I'm like, ""Look at this bozo who doesn't know a thing about who I am."""

This but with lots more swear words.
I did this but because I didn't realize it was bullying. Also that fit slaps unironically
The best part is that it’s Bubbles from The Powerpuff Girls
Yeah I had no clue they were trying to be mean at least 75% of the time
my bullies were much less direct in the things they'd say to my face :/ it was psycho terror
Bullied since day one Jesus Christ 🥲
"I find it hilarious when some fatass who does nothing but play video games teases me for reading. ""What are you gonna do today, read a book?!"" ""yup."" They actually think that's an insult."
I just reccently realized I've been that one quiet kid everyone just agreed on hating and completely ignoring
"Once had someone I knew from high school apologize for bullying me.

I was just like ""you were bullying me?"" (Genuinely never noticed)

Needless to say he got a kick out of that"

"The most powerful I felt in middle school, one of the worst time periods in my life, was saying “thanks” when people called me “weird” and the like as an insult. It made them stop pretty quickly, but it really did make me feel good about myself and strong with mental power"
"i’ve actually done the last one.

it was a cast party for the play i was in and decided to find out who else wasn’t invited, and hosted my own cast party with everyone who was excluded from the “actual” cast party.

made a lot of my fellow actors very pissy that i didn’t just sit back and accept them being dicks on purpose. my party was more fun anyway"
ok but bullies will just straight up tell lies about you to your face and insist that they're true
when i was in 7th grade i went the whole year without knowing i was being severely bullied somehow
Okay how do you deal with the ones that literally punch you in the face? How do you condescendingly mock them in that situation?
"The clothing part is like the opposite of me. I get uncomfortable when my fit doesn't match or it doesn't compliment as well, or when like a piece looks off or whatever."

"When people bully me about being weird, I act weirder so that they stop. And continue."
This is 100% the reason I didn’t know I was bullied till years later. Like I thought I was popular and just knew everyone but turns out I was being mad bullied and just didn’t realize lmao.
"""hurr durr just don't feed the bully"" yeah sure until you get harassed both mentally and physically

this is the mentality of those who only ever experience slight aggression, you never been punched out of your weirdness, never been alienated when the circumstances require you to team up, never had your belongings vandalized, your never had your bully waiting at the exit door to extort you, oh, don't forget about being treated like a errands boy, in which you will be retaliated if you insist otherwise, hell make it 24/7 for a month if you happens to be in boarding school

sorry for the rant, idk why, it just made me a bit triggered, probably a 'tism thing"
Exactly what my karate teacher taught me.
"My one nd friend from highschool who was in with the main crowd was telling me about all the awful horrible stuff they did to each other and all the stupid dramas of that school, and how much it sucked, and that’s when I realized that the rest of my high school friends were all the rest of the neurodivergent students who were unknowingly cast out from the main crowd and so made our own friend group where instead of being aware of any of the awful stuff going on cause they didn’t wanna include us, we instead played D&D and did robotics 😂

I’m so glad they didn’t include us, even tho we never even realized that’s what they were doing at the time😂"
"The weird thing is, I did this at least once in school, then all of a sudden the bullies kept going along like they were joking the whole time, like they would tease or jokingly insult a friend.

Part of me hopes a lot of bullying I experienced was like this, then maybe I could mentally reconcile it better? Wishful thinking I guess."
It's only 15 years later when all of it hits you at the same time and you realize they were being mean that whole time that it rips you apart.
"Whenever I got bullied, I was just visibly confused why a random person was talking to me, so hitting them with a ""who are you"" diffused the situation before I knew it was one"
"This is like you are going to be all alone with a bunch of cats!  Please!!! 

They have been pulling that on Taylor Swift and her and my only question is how does she wear all black without being covered by long hair cat shedding?"
"I remember this one kid tried bullying me in primary school. I knew I was being bullied, but she was kinda bad at it? I know she upset other people with her bullying, but I think I was one of her favourite targets, and all she managed to do was annoy me. The worst she did that I remember was calling me out for having a crush on some kid (I didn’t really, it was just the average asexual fake crush), and I just said no I didn’t. So maybe a few kids laughed at me after that, but I’m pretty sure they all thought I was crazy anyway. Only other thing I can remember is her calling me unhealthy because I’m pale, which just caused a bit of confusion, because my “parents” had me on a sugar-free diet at the time"

"I love this!

Along those lines, a youtuber named Elyse Meyers; (I LOVE her channel!)

https://youtube.com/shorts/jSXkO5ehoOU?si=GLTjNlcP5oYNjaMd"
all of those are compliments to me
"I don't relate to this at all. Since a young age I knew i was different and ""wrong"" and a bad/faulty kid. I picked up on bullying very fast and was hurt by it very much. I always knew there was something wrong with me and to this day it's still very hard to accept it. I've been hyper aware of other people's comments and reactions since a very young age and it shaped me to be a very insecure and self-loathing person. 

I wish I had been confident and unaware when I was younger, like in the comic. It would've prevented a LOT of problems I still have now."
That last one is such a sick burn though.
Sometimes that works. But most of the time it doesnt
THANK GOODNESS 😭😭😭
"What do I do if they punch me? Because I always used to say ""Harder, daddy!"" and that just made a bunch of people show up at our front door."
For a moment I thought it said how to deal with Bubbles
I just asked why a lot
I don't see how any of this is bullying
I once knew i was going to mobe really far away from my school at the end of the year and actually spread rumors about myself to see how it would evolve. (Exactly how you think it would) and also if people would believe the truth (nope). I was completly unbothered by the whole thing. I also played along with some bullies because it was fun lol
The amount of time people wanted to beat me up when I was a kid and teenager is huge. The funniest things that once my classmate sent an older (20+) dude to beat me up but after I talked with him he said that I was reasonable and to call him if there are any problems
"Ok now how to deal with 40 other kids screaming at you overwhelming your senses, throwing stuff at you and then some of them cornering you and beating you, almost every day while the teachers and school authorities ignore it?"
"At the end of 7th grade, someone came up to me and formally apologized for bullying me all year. I had no fucking clue what she was talking about."
"Same!! Whenever a bully would say something to me I’d be like “that doesn’t make sense??” Or “ok…???” and they wouldn’t take it further

One boy made a comment on my appearance, I didn’t quite hear what he said, so I turned to look at him and I think the resting autism/bitch face & autism stare™️ is what made him immediately backtrack"
"Close to the end of highschool my friend told me something like ""a lot of people say mean things about you"" and I was like ""??? What do they say???"" and she responded ""...Well I don't want to repeat it""

That + a guy randomly apologizing to me for being so mean to me + I'm pretty sure my elementary school best friend was only friends with me out of pity???

Two years later and I'm still sitting here like ??? Was I bullied??? I thought I had a normal experience??? What???"
"I remember a girl teasing me daily for dressing childish. She was sarcastic and I just didn't get it, so I thought she was just genuine😭"
"I have a very similar experience.

While it made me very disliked among a lot of people, the fact that I was absolutely unphased was what impressed my best friend to a fault. I was also thought to have anger issues, which in hindsight were meltdowns. I scratched a girl's face to blood because she took one of the dolls I've put in a line in preschool. She asked me if I play with it, I said yes, she asked if she can have it, I said no, she said I don't play with it anyway and took it.

Then I got a bit older, I started to get those things and had a very public meltdown (over a guy bullying my best friend), which was anger based in 4th grade, and I've attacked a known bully and pushed him against a wall hard enough to give him a slight concussion.

He was 2 or so grades higher, and he refused to admit a little chubby girl hurt him. And even if he did, none of the teachers would believe him.

I was left off the hook, and even tho that lead to more bullying (and at some point rocks being thrown at me by people from his friend group)  he's never approached me or my friend after that. His friends tried to bully me going forward, but I was still very unphased.

I remember them once putting a full plate of leftovers on my table and saying something like ""Here for you, you fat pig."" I responded with confusion, and berated them for wasting food.

I still remember shocked faces and a few stiff laughs as they clearly didn't know what went wrong, and why I wasn't embarrassed.

I only started to recognise bullying in middle school.

And now, looking back, I think to things that were said to me, and get that it was bullying. I absolutely didn't back then.

Once a girl tried to insinuate I have lice, and I have missed that so completely it only dawned on me at the ripe age of 22."
"Similar story here, it wasn’t until I was an adult looking back that I realised I was regularly bullied. Good times"
"one time i literally got called autistic, then the same person later, when i said “im autistic leave me alone” said i didn’t seem autistic"
"Did you wear vests a lot?

A bully-proof vest, if you may..."
My friend told me I was bullied until 8th grade and I genuinely just thought I was being ignored. I think they were just bad at bullying though because the high school bullies were much more obvious.
What facts?
"I was just talking about something last week, and while I was talking I realized like ""wait is that bullying?"" and my partner was like ""uuh yeah?"" and I'm like ""holy crap I think I was bullied a lot??"" 

Situations where I was frustrated because boy hurts me, I hurt him back, I get in trouble but not him. I am upset about being in trouble not about the boy hurting me lol"
"As a fellow autist, I concur with your concurring of the autism experience."
Beautiful. Chef's kiss
"Why are they always so desperate to change us for their preference, when they could just like... Fuck off and do something else??"
"Exactly. This is cute and all, but it’s still bullying and it will affect you no matter how you react to it."
"I basically pretended to not care and be fine with it but I was actually constantly fantasizing about just walking out the school gates one day and just walking, walking, walking, no destination other than *anywhere other than school or home* since neither was safe and nobody seemed to give a shit."
"Yeah, when it's in your nature to be kind and genuine, cruelty is particularly hard. Ultimately though, the only thing that will make a bully back down is resistance. They're deliberately making your life unpleasant, which gives you license to treat them the same. You have to push however hard it takes to make them back down, then they'll leave you be. Cheerful indifference is a powerful weapon against a bully, and unless they have actual authority/power over you, there's nothing they can do about it."
Almost like this is bad advice on how to handle bullying 🤷‍♂️
"""Okay."" \*blank stare\* - usually works for me."
"There are a lot of other things that can also look like autism but if you go to a good diagnostician they will test you for signs of those at the same time as they test for autism.

Also! Things that help autistic people can also help allistic people! My common example is that almost everyone can get benefits from stimming. Having more awareness is generally a good thing even if it turns out the label doesn't totally fit. *More encouraging noises*"

"No one ever apologised to me. I guess I just kinda realised it as I grew older and understood what was appropriate to say and what wasn't. After that I realised a lot of the inappropriate things were actually said to me as a kid and I just brushed it off as 'yeah that's true' or 'I know. Did you only figure that out now?'. Sometimes when they'd call me things that I knew weren't true I'd just think to myself 'wow, that person is stupid. They don't even know that's not true'. I just never saw it as bullying. It was always just them being factual based off of evidence, or me thinking they were unintelligent because they were wrong about something."
🔥
Why do you think she was only friends with you out of pity?
"Honestly the only time I recognised bullying was when it happened to my best friend. It only happened twice from what I saw though cause people kinda learnt to leave her alone.

The first girl I hurt during gym class. I saw her hand was too low on the hockey stick, i did try to be nice and tell her to move it up, but she didn't listen to me, because she was too busy saying rude things to her friend about my friend. So I swung my stick and fractured her hand. Didn't meant to actually break anything, just wanted to hurt her for bullying my friend. 

The second time I hit a girl in the head with a hockey puck because my friend told me she had tried to flirt with her boyfriend, saying that she would be better for him than my friend. So during gym class I was purposely aiming my stick at an angle so I could cause the puck to lift, and it hit her perfectly in the forehead. 

Got in trouble both times, and after that the teacher didn't want me participating in hockey anymore because for some reason people kept getting hurt by me. The bullies stopped though so I guess that's a positive."
"Things like me being chubby as a kid, having freckles, being too quiet, not smiling enough, being weird and not looking at people when they talk to me.

 These were all things that were true about me as a child, so I found it odd that someone would point something out that was already pretty obvious. I thought they were oblivious people who didn't notice things as well as me. Turns out they were just trying to bully me for things that were true, and I didn't pick up on it."
"This coincides naturally, as an autistically inclined individual, my concurring with both of your concurrences."
Hpapy cake dau
"The weirdest thing is the part about how it's not fine to be happy regardless. Like, sure, you're miserable, but not everyone has to be."
Show em your fluoride stare!
"Very true! Yessss for real, everyone should stim more. I stim a lott and it feels great whether I’m allistic or not :3! I’m gonna look into going to a diagnostician for sure because I also suspect I may have adhd anyways!"
"True enough dude. I just offer the anecdote to say yeah, same, mood. It’s weird how that works out sometimes, or at least weird that other people don’t really realize that what they say comes across as either factual or confusing/untrue instead of hurtful like they intend"
So true
"It clicked when my mom said ""[friends dad] used to babysit you every time I needed to go to the doctors or get surgery!"". I ASSUMED my friend was inviting me out because she wanted to hang out with me, but looking back on it I think she was just bringing me along because her dad said she had to.

She would also sometimes use that ""overly polite"" tone of voice she used on strangers/kids while talking to me (""woww, thats soo cool! 🙂"") and we really just didn't have much in common. We stopped talking completely once we started highschool, probably because it was the first time we didn't have classes together and I didn't need a babysitter anymore. Once there were no more obligations she dipped!

It all makes sense in hindsight!"
"Oh, I also played hockey!

Grass hockey unfortunately, as we didn't have a skating ring in my home city. I've beaten my cousin who was shit-talking my friend (he was friends with the bully) with my hockey stick after I warned him not to come any closer or I'll hit him.

It happened as I was walking  back from hockey training, near my street. I never got in trouble for that, either."
Thank you! I didn't even know it was my cake day!
"One caveat I think is worth mentioning, there are some things an autistic person can experience that are easily mistaken for something else, and that need drastically different care. 

For example, autistic burnout can look a lot like depression, but some strategies you'd use to help with depression (get out and do things, etc.) generally don't help autistic burnout. Likewise, some strategies to help with autistic burnout (get more rest, limit obligations, etc.) don't tend to help with depression. It's also possible to be both depressed and burned out at the same time.

I guess what I'm saying is, try what makes sense to you. Give it a good effort when you do. And if you give something a fair chance but find it isn't helping, maybe look at other ideas."
"I thought I had ADHD because of r/ADHDMEMES 

But currently they're thinking only aspergers though I haven't been sent to the neuro specialist yet.

My doc told me to ask for more then just ADHD because if they only check that thing and it's not that they might just write you off.

So when asking for diagnosis it's good to say you might suspect those cupple of things.

ADHD and AUTISM really do share a lot and you can have both."
"Sometimes it just feels like they're grasping at things. If I was to try and understand the mind of a bully, they're probably deeply insecure and the things they point about you are things they're afraid of when it comes to themselves. It makes them feel more superior to us, because ha ha, we suffer with xyz and they don't, so funny, and so they attempt at putting us down. When that doesn't work, they'll try and grasp at any little thing to try and find some way to put us down. The ironic part about it is they don't realise how pathetic it is to need internal gratification by attempting to hurt someone else, but then proceeding to fail miserably at it."
"I don't have issues understanding tone of voice or facial expressions most of the time. I don't have many issues with body language. I can read people pretty freaking well, maybe that's the trauma though. 

While I have some issues with black and white thinking, it's really easy for me to change my mind on something if the reasoning is explained to me. The only time this becomes a ""black and white thinking"" moment is when people refuse to answer my questions about their viewpoint, or when their viewpoint is actively harming people. 

I don't have issues modulating my volume. 

I don't have issues understanding humor most of the time, or metaphors."
"Knowing everything about your special interests. I can't really obsess over special interests enough to learn everything about them.   


Schedule. I can't keep a schedule. I want to. When I have schedules I thrive, but I can't maintain one, at least not on my own."
"Apparently a common Autistic trait is struggling to understand fiction. I don't struggle with it *at all*. I've been a creative writer for 22 years. When I'm not writing fanfiction, I write high fantasy which requires an *immense* amount of effort, time, and creativity to create from scratch."
"I’m not a picky eater ! I love new foods and new textures and tastes. If I see something on a menu I’ve never had I *HAVE* to get it. I also don’t mind my foods touching or eating them together (tho I did when I was a kid). With that said tho I still have food issues. I just had a meltdown a few minutes ago because my tamale wasn’t “correct” so,, there’s that lmao"
Low empathy. I got tons and hate it so much.
Lack of vocal expression. I actually think I’m too expressive to a point where people just don’t listen to me because I’m “annoying” or “fake”.
"When people say this that and the other sensory experience ""hurts"", non of mine hurt as I know ""hurt"".

They are distressing, they cause me problems and troubles but I certainly would not refer to it as pain.

I perceive pain as physical damage. Emotions I find hard to describe, I've been heartbroken and generally messed up but I dont know if would describe that as pain either although the world calls it emotional pain I guess."
i don’t struggle with eye contact if i’m close with someone. only strangers
"I don't have a hard time making friends.

Loads of social issues, but I just manage to stumble into friendships.

Though it does often result in the awkward conversation of me having to explain to people I'm not flirting with them/trying to be their friend when it ends up being someone I genuinely do not like."
"Being antisocial. I was incredibly social as a child and was constantly talking, I never shut up. I was terrible at making friends and never understood social cues, always talked about the wrong things or asked embarrassing or rude questions. But I was still very very social."
"I despise weighted blankets, and all deep pressure it makes me feel like I’m being cornered and I need to escape from something"
"Apparently being “gifted kid” is common….I was not the “gifted kid” LOL
I would hit my head off the desk instead of doing my work, teachers hated me, they locked my ass in a closet. But hey, I made it to college!"
"infodumping, sure I somethimes like to talk about stuff I'm interested in. but to tell someone a whole fact based information for 1+ min. is just too much for me. like I can only send loads of info throughout text or post, but that is only because my brain is allowed to be distracted, and take it's time to get to a knew fact about the subject. but when I'm talking to another person it is more like ""hey did you know that wolverines can smell 6 km far, so when animals are trapped under an avalanche, the wolverine can dig up the now death animals and eat them"" but that's like it, and only when we are talking about a simular subject. but I cannot go on about other mustelid facts, or snow facts. no that's it, my brain can't tell you more now"
Going nonverbal. I hear about that a lot but I’m not sure I understand the concept.
Taking things literally and missing sarcasm. I’m a big fan of sarcasm and idioms. I only take things literally when reading a novel and a sentence comes up like “the hills were like white elephants” but when someone’s being sarcastic I can tell pretty much every time.
I barely ever stim.
Alexithymia. Absolutely no sign of it!

"Masking, as far as I can tell I'm the same person in all contexts. It's one of the main reasons I think I have trouble staying employed."
"Trains. I dont understand what all the fuss is about.

Edit: not loving wind turbines, on the other hand, is crazy-talk."
also very empathetic. just don’t know how to express it properly i think
"*I LOVE FOODS WITH LOTS OF COMPLEX FLAVOR.* Only liking bland foods I don’t vibe with. My executive dysfunction just means typical “bland” foods are my go to because they’re easy to make, but I love making more complex things when the inspiration strikes."
"Routines, or need for sameness. I like to change things up."
"Sensory issues regarding sound or vision, at least to a level where it is so painful like a lot of folks describe. I mean yeah some things are nasty and disstressing, we now enter the season where I get a little overstimulated by just going outside bc its so fucking bright but I am not dying like many say. This is actually the only thing I can think of"
"\- I look at other people or in their eyes to feel safe. but not always, since germany is the country of resting b face and murderous looks.

\- i'm apparently quite expressionist. well, i'm also loud but that's something else.

\- i'm not musically talented. (google can't find out the song I've sung/hummed) i always sing in the wrong range. but my choir teacher says it sounds good, because i can ""sell the song"" good, so i'll continue. (sell the song means that it has power inside. i could go acapella, since it has it's own melody automatically)

\- i don't have super powers. all i have are super disabilities

\- i love getting hugs 

~~- i don't look autistic enough apparently. srly, stop saying ""i've heard/seen other autistic people and there nothing like you""~~"
"it’s too hard for me to unmask even around my closest friends. the only time i’m truly autisticly me, is when i’m by myself. (and i love my friends, it’s not their fault)"
I’m pretty social when I’m comfortable with the person
"One thing that threw me off initially were all the questions about numbers, and pattern-recognition always being brought back to math in some way. Then it clicked that the patterns I recognise are linguistic, and that ability is exactly why I'm good at learning languages and expressing myself both verbally and in writing. So the stereotype of all autistics repeating lines from films or doing echolalia or needing rigid scripts in conversations never fit me."
Loneliness
"I tend to be pretty good at reading subtleties and indirect communication. I don’t like it, but I do pick up on it."
"This is less something I don’t relate to than something that has changed over time? Or a couple things. I used to do dinosaur arms but found that I stopped doing them over the last year. I recently found out that one theory on why we do dinosaurs arms is because of weak shoulder joints and over the last year I’ve been doing aerial silks (hence strengthening the joint) so my theory is strong shoulders means you’re less likely to do/relate to dinosaur arms. 

The other one, is I used to do physical stims but have since stopped doing that (no idea why) and have no urge to do them anymore. I do wonder if I’ve replaced these stims in some way and haven’t identified with what tbh.

Just thought I’d share these as a way of pointing out that although a common experience of autism is struggling with change (which has my adhd and autism at freaking war omg), change does still happen and that can be in our symptoms, coping mechanisms, whatever."
"The loud noises, I like loud music"
[deleted]
Masking. I grew up around a couple fake people that I couldn't stand. So I've always valued being genuine.
meltdowns - i frequently shutdown but only have meltdowns maybe once every two months?
"Being able to hyperfocus. I've been told I might also have ADHD, but I'm not so sure."
Not making eye contact. I’m the exact opposite in that I make too much eye contact.
"I live in metaphor. I swim in metaphor. Figurative language is my love language.   Literary analysis is my form of fun. 

It made me think for a while it wasn’t possible I’m autistic, because “not understanding figurative language” is such a norm. I think that’s a factor for everyone in late diagnosis, though, ditching the internalized stereotypes and learning about the nuance and broad range of how traits can present. 

I have this theory that everything about being autistic is more likely to be extreme. Too much empathy or too little. Food averse or willing to try anything. Intellectually disabled or “gifted.”  Needing pressure or any constriction feeling like too much. Tiny spoons or big spoons, but big feelings about it either way!"
Going nonverbal and difficulty keeping friendships. I am so loud that I awkwardly befriend all the ND people around me.
I like a wide variety of food and especially spicy stuff.
"Meltdowns, I kinda grew out of them, I know most don’t but I just kinda grew out of it when I became a teenager, idk if I just got good at holding it in cause “men don’t cry” but yeah I just kinda, don’t…"
"**Low empathy:** I’ve always been really empathetic, like to the point where I’ll catch contact grief from people I don’t even know. Probably why my anxiety is so high, because I’m constantly aware and terrified of unknowingly making people upset. 

**Being really good at your special interest or something related:** Like, I’m pretty knowledgeable about my special interests but I’m still generally not all that good at anything. I’m just always average no matter how long or how much I love doing something. 

**Some people say lack of imagination is an autism trait:** certainly not for me though. My imagination has always been incredibly high.

**Not being able to read sarcasm or taking things literally:** this one does trip me up sometimes, but in general I can tell when someone’s joking or being sarcastic. Though for some reason I still tend to react as if I don’t understand it. Idk why."
"I have a sing-songy voice instead of the stereotypical robot voice. I also have a very expressive face about half the time, although I do give the stereotypical blank face the other half of the time."
I’m very expressive. I use my hands while I talk and my tone fluctuates a lot
"Not understanding sarcasm, I'm sarcastic and can tell when people are sarcastic... most of the time atleast."
"Being content during the 2020 lockdown. I suffered tremendously, had constant meltdowns, and was miserable the whole time! It should have been heaven for me because I live completely alone.

It was absolute hell instead.

The whole situation made me realize that I'm a seemingly rare Autistic extrovert."
"Meltdowns. I don't think I've ever had one. I once cried while at a loud disco but I calmed down easily once I left, so I don't think that counts.

Using ear defenders. I hate big chunky earphones, I'd rather just put in noise cancelling headphones and turn my music up loud. 

Sarcasm. I can use it, but I struggle to understand it when others use it. 

I didn't start stimming until I developed Tourette's 2 years ago. Until then, I'd never stimmed in my life.

Lack of imagination. I've always loved creative writing, and I often daydream to pass the time."
hating pictures of spoons and forks. i do have my favorites though but i don’t HATE hate unusual cutlery
"I might be mistaken, but I’ve noticed a lot of people an autism-related subs into drugs, whereas I have a massive fear of drugs/alcohol/anything similar"
"I do not have severe sensory issues. 

I do not have stereotypical interests. 

I do not struggle with showing facial expressions.

I do not have a flat monotone voice

I do not struggle with speech impairment.

I do not find it impossible to keep eye contact 

I do not have only 1 interest

I do not have supreme intellegence 

I do not experience frequent meltdowns 

I do not excell at math

I am not antisocial 

I don’t lack creativity or imagination

I don’t lack empathy 

I am not a 10 year old boy

I am not single"
I am the opposite of a picky eater.
repetitive behaviour
"Hypersensitivity to sound. I had it when I was a kid, but not anymore, no idea why."
"I feel like I get social clues, like yes I strugged socially at least at my job, since their are allistics, and don't have a background with taking care of ND people, but I don't really relate to when Autistic people ask what the NT people mean when they say something.

I also not sure if I get overstimated, I have meltdowns with anger and whne I'm already upset I do get overwelmed, but I also don't relate when talk about something being too loud, or too bright. I think there was only one time when I get truly overstimulated.

Mostly I worry I was misdiagnosed, and I only have Autistic traits, but I might be wrong since no one ever doubted it but me, inculding a specia ed teacher, but whenever I read about people talking about their autistic exprience, or making memes I don't really relate."
not being social. i am SUCH a social person and i can’t even go a day without talking to someone
"I don't have a special interest, and never have. Yes, there are things I'm passionate about, but not to the extent of a special interest."
"I do have some routine and struggle with change in some ways, but I don't have a rigid schedule. Similarly, I do sometimes crave sameness and need a certain amount of it to feel comfortable, but I also sometimes crave novelty. It's a push/pull.

I don't really think I have black and white thinking, at least not about most things. My brain sometimes craves certainty, but I typically recognize shades of gray and sometimes overthink them a lot.

I wonder if these things are the result of co-morbid ADHD and OCD, respectively."
"not being lonely. i see a lot of autistic people saying how they like to be alone wheres i cant stand it, i would love to have friends."
"I don’t have many problems with clothing. Sure, tags do bug me, and obviously I’m more comfortable in some clothing than others, but I don’t get overstimulated by my clothing"
"Having/understanding empathy. I see SO many autistic people be super empathetic and so sensitive to others’ feelings, but I just… can’t comprehend that. I’m me, I have no idea what it’d be like if I were in someone else’s shoes. Even if I’ve been in the situation they were. It’s just so hard for me to get my head around it…"
"Haven’t seen this one yet so- Hand flapping! I generally don’t have outward stims in general, I don’t have enough energy that I need to express it outwardly- Its all internal, which I guess makes it make sense that people often can’t tell if I’m happy or excited. But I see this sort of commonality of hand flapping so often that for a while, it made me feel like some sort of imposter. :("
"This is going to sound weird but I can't relate to people with such strict dietary preferences, I don't mind eating the same meal everyday but I also don't mind eating different meals everyday nor do I mind branching out and trying new things."
"I don't relate to most people on here who are seeking diagnosis or diagnosed late in life, since I was diagnosed when I was only 4, it's a whole other world growing up diagnosed compared to undiagnosed."
"I don't like trains. They're designed for maximum human density, they smell bad, they get overly hot, there are no sensory safe zones on them, they're loud...

I don't understand why so many Autistic people like them. They're really awful!"
"Food. I love it a little too much, and my list of foods that I can't stand is very, very minimal."
Not struggling with social nuances (unless my social battery is empty) not being a picky eater. Not minding bright light. Needing human interaction. Like lack of physical touch makes me depressed.
"Struggling with eye contact. Quite the opposite, when I don't mask I stare unblinking right into people's souls."
I don't have sensory issues.
Needing routine while I don’t like change I don’t need a routine I just need reminders to help me remember things
"Aversion to touch.

I am very physically affectionate with the people that I feel closest to and most comfortable with--particularly my boyfriend. I love massages, though I've only been able to try massage therapy a handful of times throughout my life. If I didn't live someplace so rural and if they weren't so pricey, I'd probably get them regularly. That said, I don't want to be touched by strangers without my consent (but I imagine that may be typical even for neurotypical folk)."
Not understanding idioms. I fucking love poetry so I hyperfixate on every line which has built a secure database of idioms in my brain. Some still catch me off guard occasionally.
"I like physical contact! I particularly love hugs.

I also like new food! I’m the opposite of a picky eater."
"I don't always say what I mean. I'm very indirect, because I'm too anxious in any social situation to be direct - I'm always worried about what they'll think."
"Excessive empathy. 

Example, my favorite non living thing is my car. Lady opened her truck door, the wind caught it (because she literally just opened it without holding it at all) it smashed into my car so hard I thought I was hit by a moving vehicle. I acted like I didn’t care at all because I was immediately just concerned about how she felt about hitting my car…"
"waay too many i think.

im pretty good at describing things verbally, including emotions, i read into tones and intention more than the avarage person (which is the biggest cause of impostor syndrome), bright lights and loud noises dont bother me too much, i can stand them for a while, i dont have ""meltdows"" theyre more like shut downs, i get quiet, frozen, and unthinking.

Since people describe meltdowns as ""a toddler at a candy store not getting what he wants"", i for a long time thought i couldnt even be close to the spectrum;

So much ableism all around me when growing up. I ended upo picking some thoughts im not proud of"
I’m not a picky eater at all. I also have no regular routine I need to stick to. Both may be related to ADHD that I also have.
"I definitely still have issues with it, but I'm not horrible at tone indication and am a lot better at it than my also autistic friends. I occasionally get extremely confused, but most of the time, im really good at using context clues."
"Whether or not I can ""read"" others ""accurately"" and the whole empathy thing. The doctor and I spent a lot of time discussing this (through the masculine energy bent lens...) because I know I can read others EXTREMELY adeptly its just I deliberately ignore the ""red flags"" to survive in the group because I'm used to them just being my experience, unfortunately. That's changed since I've woken up to all of this! If you resonate with this you are welcome and not an imposter in my heart. Sending love."
I don’t have problems with clothing labels
"I've never collected things, at least not purposefully."
Dyspraxia and general difficulty in motor coordination
[removed]
"I kind of love change? Or at least I feel like I become really dead inside when I don't have the stimulation that change causes. I get bored really easily. I do do better with routines in some ways - particularly when it takes the ""thinking"" out of a decision like getting out of bed. But I also get so bored, so so so bored, when I have a routine. So... ??? 

I guess this is the ADHD + autism situation 😬"
"High empathy. I have very little and it's one of those things that I understand that many autistic people don't relate to, and that most people dislike being assumed to have low empathy. 

But at the same time, it sometimes feels like some people (mostly outside of Reddit) just hate people with low empathy, so when discussions on empathy happen I just kinda go like 👁️👄👁️


Another one is to do with special interests. I couldn't tell you much about any of mine, nor do I like talking about them. I just sort of can't?? It's probably to do with my awful ability to retain information, and my lack of skill organizing said info."
"Autistic meltdowns

Sensory overloads. At least I feel like I get overwhelmed at the same rate as NT's

Delayed language skill. I was always pretty good at languages. I mostly sucked at precise things like math, chemistry and physics

Sensitivity to crowds.

I get along with people quite easily

I can communicate decently, although with hiccups

I don't mask. I learned in a trial and error how to behave and I am mostly genuinely myself. Learning social skills was one hell of a climb though. I was told it was like teaching a teddybear how to be human. Any time I see someone who doesn't have social skills or awareness, I think of how easily that could have been me if I didn't have people who taught me."
Omg I only read the title first and I was like “Huhh why only diagnosed ones??” And then I read the test.. thanks <3
So-called “breakdowns” or “shut downs”. It has never happened to me. Just kinda go with the flow on everything and don’t really let things get to me
I can make eye contact easily and I have empathy to the point it could be disabling when I was younger.
I've seen this answer a lot but the kinda stereotype at this point that all autistic people are cold/heartless. I have very high empathy and have never understood that
"People who talk about female autism and too much empathy, I don’t relate to."
"“Black and White” thinking. I always think about nuances of things, probably way too deeply for me own good. 

Autistics are no where near as rigid and dogmatic in our views as people say we are. Yes I’m speaking for a number of us because I know I’m not the only autistic who thinks this way."
My 9yo daughter doesn’t have any sort of hyper fixation or anything that she’s tremendously good at. She’s AuDHD and can’t focus on anything long enough to develop a deep passion or a special interest.
"Punctuality. I see a lot of posts on here that they're always late. Not me. If I'm less than an hour early, I am late. Two hours if it's at an airport."
"I hate small spaces, I’m claustrophobic. 
I also do make eye contact (I’ve trained myself to) and have too much empathy (empathy for inanimate objects and people I don’t know)
I am fine with certain ‘uncomfortable’ textures such as the seams of socks or some tags (but cant stand itchy fabrics and some tags.)
I can talk and make conversation but with some difficulty.
I am very polite and courteous but this is all learned not natural, and I do have an awareness of social rules which I try to follow. 
I like loud music, I enjoy rock and some punk and metal songs."
"I’m hypo sensitive to light, not hypersensitive. I need to have every light in my apartment on at all times and I have several lamps including a torchiere lamp that shines up at the ceiling to make the room brighter overall via reflection. I convinced my boyfriend to get one for his place because I hate dark or dim lighting SO MUCH.

I do get sick to my stomach looking at a bright screen in a dark room (contrast BAD), or if there’s too much blue light in general, so I’d say I’m still sensitive, just not in the stereotypical way at all"
"i love spices and a lot of seasons on food, and its almost unbearable to me eat something with such plain flavor"
"I love metaphors, similes, turns of phrase, puns, and the like, and use them all the time. Similarly I've never gone non-verbal, and in fact have a bad tendency to babble that only increases when I'm stressed."
Social cues. I mostly get those but I think that's a trauma response that made me hyper vigilant to the moods of those around me
"Not liking hugs or physical touch. I like it a lot, especially from my SO"
"Whilst I would say I have special interests I don't have the time or mental capacity to deep dive research on them. I can't tell you a bunch of cool facts or anything, it's just a casual enjoyment perhaps to a more excessive extent. This is probably in large part due to my atrocious memory. And to that point I don't have just a couple which is another reason I don't deep dive. My special interest is EVERYTHING but if you ask I will not want/be able to talk about any of them.

I mostly don't struggle with empathy and can be overly empathetic but I do have quite black and white thinking and will often treat situations with logic rather than emotion. 

I don't have a problem understanding facial expressions or emotions or tone of voice, my problem is knowing how to replicate them and what a suitable response is. I can sit and observe a conversation and fully understand, I just can't participate. 

Rather than getting overstimulated by bright flouresant lights I get stressed out when the lighting is too dim and not clear enough. This is a real pain in the arse in autistic spaces!

I love flavourful foods! My struggle with food comes with wanting a meal to be perfect and exactly what I want so I often won't eat because I don't have exactly what I want or can't decide what I want.

I absolutely love concerts that are deafeningly loud but if somebody drops a pen on the floor I'll jump out of my skin.

Despite all of this I've been diagnosed since I was 7! And I'm afab so that's pretty good going I'd say."
.
"I was officially diagnosed a few days ago, after almost a year of dealing with imposter syndrome. 

I don’t have any special interests, not ones that have lasted my whole life anyways. I’ve never used scripts or practiced socializing. Instead of trying to socialize I’ve just isolated myself, most/all of my friends were online when I was younger. 

I had no developmental delays.

I think the biggest indicator for me was how alienated I felt from the rest of society, like everyone else was in on some joke I wasn’t apart of. I’ve always suppressed many of my symptoms, so I experienced things that weren’t noticeable to others. 

There is so much we do not know about autism, and there are infinite ways in which it can present itself in an individual. Really fascinating."
Schedules -i hear about how routines and schedules help so many people so i want to try and see if sticking to one helps me but I just can't seem to do it!
"Noticing patterns. In fact, I’m more known for being not very perceptive."
I understand sarcasm and regularly use it
"I have a lot of empathy, and can often recognise when an emotion is different or changed. But saying this, I can get it wrong in the sense that I can’t recognise what the emotion has changed to. I just know when somethings not quite right"
"I love loud noises. Providing obviously they’re not sudden. I can go to a loud concert, with the bass booming through my chest and maybe developing temporary tinnitus, but I love how loud it is. 

Similarly, I can go to a football match with everyone chanting and screaming (though with my team because a bad refereeing decision, not us scoring lol). All jokes aside, I’m completely fine with that.

The only time I’m not fine is in unexpected scenarios. I’ll give you an example: I went on holiday last year, and one night (maybe 8:30) we (my dad, younger brother and I) decided to go to the amusements. It was pretty dark by that point, so I wrongly assumed there wouldn’t be too much noise. I was wrong. Very wrong. It seemed like everyone there was hellbent on making as much noise as possible. And I could barely move there were that many little shits running about. I felt reeeallly uncomfortable, and I just wanted to nope the FUCK out of there. But I couldn’t because masking. 

Anyways, rant over, the first paragraph would’ve been enough."
"i don’t like plain foods, i love flavour."
I really like spicy foods.
"No light sensitivity, and I understand sarcasm."
"I’m not a picky eater, I’m awful with numbers and math, and I couldn’t care less about trains and train schedules."
Being shy
Super picky with food. I love food and have never been picky with it exempt for one year where I was sort of but yeah I’ve always eaten lots and tried new things. Hated oysters but as a younger kid when I lived close to the supermarket we would always buy octopus it was my favourite snack
"I have hyper empathy and hyperlexia. It's totally common in autism but people usually picture the side of the spectrum where people have low empathy, or are fully non verbal.

Otherwise honestly I am quite the usual autistic fellow which does not show much because I have a good coat of ADHD on top that throw people off."
"Not making eye contact and struggling with conversation. Im pretty extraverted and dont struggle with this at all. 

I do get a lot of having too big of a personality, im hard to be around for long periods cuz I talk too much about interests, my personality is overpowering, my data dumping can come across as  talking down to people (maybe this is true, not intended but I read a LOT!), my sense of justice is frustrating. 

So struggle to connect with people - yes. 

Struggle to small talk and eye contact - not at all."
"Being gaslighted, i don't notice it if it IS happening."
"I'm good at conveying emotions through my voice. At least, when I'm relatively calm. If I'm upset, it'll show a lot. I'm planning on becoming a voice actor."
"I am a master of sarcasm and have no issues understanding it. I have no problems with jokes and humor as long as it isn't humor that puts other people down. I will never understand that.

I don't really physically stim. I internalize things. At most I will just fidget with my fidget rings.

I don't care about food touching and I'm not super picky."
"My grand son eats chicken nuggets, waffles, life cereal.  Our family is in the food industry so we have and do eat good food.  It’s the most frustrating of all his symptoms."
"I dont know any facts about my special interests. They are animes, cartoons, zelda, politics, and urban planning. I know a lot of concepts relating to them and I could talk about them for hours, but I don't have any facts or figures. Facts and figures tend to be the autism thing but I only understand concepts."
Stimming and sensory
"I don’t struggle with first impressions, especially in scenarios that have observable rules (job interviews). Anything deeper than that, like team collaboration, friendship building, romantic dates, or social gatherings are difficult. I have been unexpectedly successful in school and work for someone with a learning disability, but I struggle with my personal life because I’m overly empathetic and anxious. I try not to tell people I’m autistic. Still, everyone seems to know there’s something ‘off’ and I can see how I’m treated differently."
"I don't stim much at all, only during a panic attack"
"the sensory issues thing. yeah i had sensory issues with hearing and stuff, but other than that, i’m not one to really care about taste, texture, feeling, etc. infact, i don’t order the same thing everytime when i’m at a sit down restaurant (not including fast food, i tend to order the same stuff) but if i’m at like a mexican place, i wanna try new things. i get bored when i eat the same stuff over and over again. usually if it’s like a chain, i usually order a burger just to see how the food is in general (you can’t really fuck up a burger too) and if i like it, i’ll order something else. 

i would apparently eat almost anything as a kid as i wasn’t really a picky eater growing up."
" Not being able to cry or express my emotions 

I am a VERY emotional person"
"i don’t understand the use of the term “imposter syndrome” here. it’s my understanding that this term is generally used to describe high-achieving women who struggle to accept that their success is earned and deserved, but here it seems to be used to describe people who have some doubts about being autistic or who have been told by professionals that they are not autistic, but who struggle or are unwilling to accept that they might not be autistic. 

i do not relate to that experience. someone close to me suggested i might be autistic, i went through an assessment which resulted in a diagnosis, and i accepted that. if the assessment had not resulted in a diagnosis, i would have accepted that. i didn’t go into it looking for confirmation of something i already knew, i went into it looking to find out. i also wasn’t excited or relieved or any of the other positive emotions i regularly see people sharing after receiving their diagnosis. it seems a lot of people are really invested in autism as part of their identity, but i do not relate to that either. 

also i don’t like to be alone."
"I’m fine with touch, in fact I’m quite touchy with people I’m close to- I hug all my boys and my fiancé’s family, and when I’m in a meltdown my fiancé’s touch never fails to calm me. With strangers I only permit a handshake or fist bump, but they could get promoted one day.

I’m also pretty good at lying and manipulating, courtesy of an overprotective and moderately authoritarian mother."
"I don’t get weirded out by physical touch or prolonged eye contact, and I’ll inhale all food because I truly don’t care what I’m eating as long as it’s calories and protien"
"I’m perfectly fine with hugs and I’m a very touchy person overall. I do get sensory issues from it once in a while if I’m really tired or if it’s a very light touch, but in general it’s not an issue and I can actually get really depressed if I go a while without a good hug."
"Don’t confusing making eye contact with what you were forced to do growing up. People think I’m making eye contact, but in all reality I’m just looking at the middle of the bridge of their nose. I haven’t met a person that can tell the difference. My father used to grab my face and force me to make eye contact, same with most people in my life. I found that overtime that kind of just causes you to hide stims and all the things that make you “weird”. I didn’t start showing true signs of autism (that I can remember) until I was in my 30s, it started happening slowly after my father died. It broke my mask and now I can’t hide all the things I used to hide anymore."
"- being a picky eater/only eating bland foods. i still have samefoods but theyre more like meals than singular foods (for example, i have a salad every day which seems like it has a lot of different flavors/foods in it but i always make it the same way). and i love spice

- touch avoidant. i love hugs and cuddling

- prefer to be sedentary.. i love being active but my physical health gets in the way

- having trouble understanding internal cues, i.e hunger, tiredness, emotions, etc.. i'm pretty aware of everything that goes on inside my body and mind. i'm a diabetic so i kind of had to learn my body for the sake of not dying

- meltdowns... i dont think ive had any since i was a child

- special interests. i have things im passionate about but i cant spend like a whole day thinking about it

- low empathy.. i only experience that when im burnt out

- more comfortable with routines. sure, they help me function better.. but it's insanely boring"
No problem with eye contact and have a very broad palate.
"I don’t have a “special interest”. I also gave ADHD and tend to have temporary hyperfixations, but there’s no one thing I have a particular strong interest in. I’m"
I don’t flap my hands unless I’m trying to dry them after washing them. 🤔
"Inability to read social cues. I can read em alright, but only after years of trial and error, and I still don’t know what to do with them."
"“but you understand social cues!” i do not. i am high masking, and it is a trauma response.

i am highly traumatized, both from my abusive parents who quite literally tried to scream the undiagnosed autism out of me as a child (or correct my behaviour through forcibly ripping my hands covering my ears), and from the violent physical ~~bullying~~ abuse i endured in junior high (of which, no one helped me for, only either mocked me, blamed me, or judged me, and in which teachers assisted those students or gave them free passes to abuse me). 

to a lot of people i “don’t seem autistic”, and i want to just respond with “thanks, it’s the ptsd i got from being autistic and allistics hating my guts”. 

though, i think you asked for things that other autistic people didn’t go through, and i know tons of autistic people who have similar experiences, so i guess just discard this."
I really like hanging out with other people and going places to events etc even tho I have anxiety I crave connecting with people.  I also have adhd though.
"I don’t think my special interests are as intense as other people’s. Typically with others, they know every little detail and history of their special interest but for me I definitely know more about my special interest compared to NT people but still not at the same intensity."
I'm grateful this post exists. I'm diagnosed but struggle a lot with imposter syndrome for not fitting the stereotype.
"""Autistic people lack creativity""

\- I am highly creative and I have won awards for my creative writing

""They cannot understand jokes""   
  
\- I can understand jokes and sarcasm (to a degree)

""They cannot think abstractly""   
  
\- I am able to do abstract thought (I am very philosophical in general and I'm very good at math which is basically all abstract)"
"Aversion to water. I love water, swimming, showers, and bathing. It's relaxing to me."
"Liking animals. Animals make me uncomfortable. Not afraid, or grossed out. Just uncomfortable."
"I don’t have any aversions to food tastes or textures, or textures in general, really. My only real sensory sensitivities are sound and smell and they only bother me when I’m already stressed. I could be more the sensory-seeking type, I guess.

I have no issues with sarcasm or non-literal language. I’m pretty good at reading facial expressions too.

I don’t have a particularly strong sense of justice and I have no moral objection to lying (and can lie very well). I also feel no strong obligation to follow rules and really don’t care if other people break them either. You can break a rule, get away with it and nobody else is negatively affected? Cool, go for it.

Making eye contact doesn’t make me uncomfortable, it’s just not intuitive, so I constantly have to think ‘Am I doing it too much? Too little?’"
"I don’t have meltdowns, but I do have shutdowns."
"dislike of large crowds; i love them

i may be weird and do info dumps, but i love info dumping to EVERYONE lol

**edit** also food stuff, i love trying new foods, basically i hate the texture of sweet potatoes and a few gross foods like balut (egg with chewy bird fetus inside) i'm not interested in, but i'll eat almost anything at a buffet in any cuisine"
"I understand metaphors for example when someone says ""It's raining cats and dogs"" I don't look for cats and dogs falling from the sky!"
"I feel like I hardly see anyone talk about sensory seeking vs avoidant. I actively seek out sensory input. I listen to music as loud as possible, I CONSTANTLY am eating spicy foods or petting my soft stuffies. I don’t like crowd noises and loud places but quiet is equally as annoying."
"Masking, this is mostly due I outgrew most of my autistic traits growing up cuz I got early intervention via a bunch of different therapies and a childhood-development/behavior psychologist. What little masking I do nowadays is more self-monitoring myself during conversations to ensure I don’t talk too loud or too much (I can dominate convos and I need to let others a chance to talk/share). And even then there are some days where I have no social awareness despite being very much a social butterfly. Thankfully the people in my life are understanding and let my social fuckups go."
"Being heavily involved in STEM. I love 3D modeling and animation, but that is it. Sociology and human services are my jam though.

I also really like people. They terrify me and I often need a break from them, but I do like them"
"This might not be of much help to the undiagnosed, since I can very confidently credit this to the fact that I was diagnosed at an early age. But the general experience of masking, at least the way it's commonly described. Because yes, from an early age I learned how to interact with neurotypical people in the way they expect me to interact with them. But I learned it through careful study under teachers who understood me, and didn't shame or judge me for not getting it right away. I felt like I was being taught a second language, not to act like someone I'm not. As a result, even when I interact with neurotypical people on their level, I never feel like I'm pretending to be neurotypical. I'm just speaking the neurotypical language.  
This might be a form of masking, I don't know. All I know is that it's different from how I often see masking described, both in the way I do it and the effect doing it has on me. Either way, I'm incredibly thankful that I was given the support I needed, so I don't have to go through the same awful experiences as others like me, and hope more people can have that opportunity."
"I am indifferent to trains, I don't understand the obsession. I also don't mimic other peoples speech patterns or accents. I've never gone non verbal."
"I have never had an issue with talking to people or making small talk. I make friends very easily and am usually pretty outgoing. - however I feel like i can struggle with keeping friends just because I like being at home 😂 all of my closest friends actually live a couple of hours away

Another one i see often is not understanding sarcasm, i am so fucking sarcastic 😂

The struggling to understand what people are thinking and feeling is definitely not me I am very empathetic and think about the reasoning behind why people think/feel/act certain ways to a point where i let shit slide that shouldn’t because i can see that it comes from a place of trauma or hurt. 

The routines thing yes and no, I definitely have some routines that if they are thrown i’m confused but I also have ADHD so a lot of routine especially very specific routines don’t work for me. 

The not liking physical affection like being touched or hugged. I am very much a physical affection person and am almost always down for a hug 

I don’t really have a specific special interest, there are definitely a few things i know a lot about but I don’t go out of my way to research them or anything unless it is relevant. I have a lot of random fun facts though 

Avoiding eye contact isn’t usually an issue for me depending on how i’m feeling


Ultimately though Autism is a spectrum and we tend to be sensory seeking or sensory avoidant. For example stereotypically Autistics like bland food but sensory seeking Autistics love food with a lot of flavour and spice."
"Being diagnosed didn't really do anything for me. It put a name to some of my struggles, but that's about it. I'm glad for those that have been validated, for me it's nothing more than a reminder I'll always struggle"
"I have alexithymia so I'm not much aware of my own emotions. But I'm hypersensitive to other people's emotions, especially if they are uncomfortable or distressed."
SPECIAL INTERESTS! I have hobbies and what not but there is not a single topic I could go on and on about in a conversation. I’m AuDHD so maybe that has something to do with it.
"I have no special interests. The closest I get is hyperfixations (likely from ADHD), but I don't have an actual special interest. I also don't really have food issues (I.e sensory/texture of foods don't really bother me)."
"Anger and impulse control issues and most thankfully meltdowns. I'm prone to shutdowns and I think I came close to meltdown before, but unless it happened in childhood and I can't recall it never happened to me and I feel pretty lucky for that. 

Anger and impulse control is a different story. Most of the time I don't feel like I'm having much in terms of impulse in the first place. But where impulse lacks, control goes strong, I tend to overanalyze decisions and actions a lot before I take them. I usually don't buy a thing unless I really need it, and I don't get angry since I don't see how anger is going to improve the situation."
"Not being good at talking abt their feelings with words.

I have learned to explain myself through words from my mom, and people are always suprised how well I can tell about these things, without being embarrassed or akward in general."
"1. Being overwhelmed by sensory overload. It does happen to me, but only when I have had a  really busy day, or when I am sick (but in this case many NT are overwhelmed by sensory overload as well). And usually I can handle it, it isn't that bad.
2. A lot of the social/communication stuff. But here I think there is a lot of variation within the autistic community, and I also think, based on both my own experience and reading the literature, the traditional psychological account is not correct, and certainly not complete, and this traditional account is one reason why I didn't think I was autistic before diagnosis. A few particular things I don't have:

2a) I prefer to talk to someone on the phone or in person rather than by email. I really like to hear someone's voice, gives me more information about someone's intention.

2b) I don't think on average I connect better with autistic people than non-autistic people, although there are a few I know, or some who are not diagnosed but come across as autistic, who I have a really good connection with. On average I think I might connect better with AD(H)D people than with autistic people.

2c) Small talk is something I do, and enjoy. However, I recently realized that a lot of my humor is taking the small talk to a very absurd place, like I (intentionally) take something literal, and take it from there.

2d) Generally, meeting people and connecting to them gives me energy. It is true that sometimes on parties I am that person who is just standing there without talking to someone because I don't know what to do, but conversations with people are to me extremely important, and are the thing that makes me the most happy.

So, I often doubt to what extend I am really autistic, or whether I have ADHD, or perhaps dyspraxia (DCD), but here are things I do have trouble with, or things that are part of the autistic experience.

WRT social issues

1. I tend to talk a lot, and loud, if I am enthusiastic. And I don't know when to stop. People who know me know that they just have to say it when they have other things to do.
2. I haven't been in a romantic relationship for all of my life, and I really don't know how to initiate that.
3. I do more than occasionally have the idea that I am the outsider in social settings, that I am not really part of it.
4. When I was younger I really had trouble maintaining friendships. When someone was out of my life (because they had moved, or I had stopped going to college), I didn't really know how to keep in touch. Now I take an effort to keep in touch if I really like this person. But still, it doesn't come naturally.

WRT non-social issues

1. I am a very picky eater.
2. I have a lot of special interests I really dive into
3. I have difficulty starting things, and when it is time I am overwhelmed by the amount of things I need to do, This has been a major thing that slowed down my academic career. So executive dysfunction, and autistic inertia are by far the most disabling part of my autism.
4. very poor motor skills. Not to the point it is disabling, but I do struggle a lot. I could never have a job where having at least average motor skills. And as a kid, I was always the one who is chosen last in games to be part of a team doesn't do wonders for your self-confidence."
"I don't need a routine. I work better without one.

I can leave the labels in my clothes. They don't irritate my skin."
"i don't need a routine

i don't have sensory issues

&#x200B;

that's about it"
"I'm not a picky eater. I have a few things I don't like (mostly due to texture), but I'm always willing to try something new. Same thing goes for repetitive meals. I'm more amenable to having the same thing over and over than the NTs in my life but I don't get dysregulated if I can't have a certain food"
"Meltdowns. I'm very good at containing myself, even though I'm exploding inside. I'm pretty neutral on emotions though, and I have been my entire life. I don't get angry, I don't show when I'm sad, and I don't get overly excited, at least outwardly!"
"Sensory overload or struggling with routine

I'm autistic but got diagnosed when I was young and got all the help I needed

I live my life easily"
"My special interests shift and come back like every 6 months, and it seems that the majority of autistic people don't seem to detect satire very well but I do just fine."
"I'm hella keen on trying out new things and not afraid to break my routine (*myself* that is)

I also love change, but not in a typical, ""routine"" kind of way (it's more complicated)"
"The routine stuff. There is absolutely nothing wrong with feeling like you need a routine to function and all that, but that is not me. I struggle to keep a routine and i am fine with not having one. I suspect I have undiagnosed ADHD so that could be it too. Most autistic things I do relate to"
bad posture
"More of a stereotype but a lot of people, including professionals think we all have low understanding of other people and low or no empathy. I'm on the opposite end of that scale. Though I'm afab, have complex trauma and ADHD too so that might have impacted me in that direction.

Just remember you don't have to have every trait to be autistic!"
"I’m pretty good liar. I don’t really want to lie and I dont enjoy it but I can. I usually lie as a defense, I think it’s part of the way I mask."
"I don’t have a visual learning style, as a child my “og” diagnosis was nonverbal learning disability ( “high” verbal iq, “low” visual spacial ) until the schools started noticing sensory issues and meltdowns. Always been good at learning via audio recordings or videos that I can listen to repeatedly but can’t memorize an image or say, read a map at all to this day."
Hand flapping. That also pisses me off.
Lack of creativity
"I can bullshit with anybody and have a huge number of acquaintances, but I can only count on one hand the number of close friends I actually have. I can have quick-forming, deep friendships but they all seem to fizzle out within a year or so, which has been incredibly painful.

Very empathetic & in-tune with my emotions.

I’ve been told I’m very nuanced in my ways of thinking, selfless, and a good friend. But I also don’t get that energy matched back to me.

I don’t have stereotypical stims. I don’t like trains. Wasn’t gifted. I don’t see autism as a superpower and find it infantilizing or condescending when I’ve had people say this to me. I just see it as my brain’s operating system being different or that I’m wired differently.

Prolonged eye contact.

Love trying new foods, but due to undiagnosed GI issues like IBS, I’m very limited on what I can safely have. I also didn’t have food sensory issues until a couple months ago and I’m now 29, so I’m so freaking confused! 😭"
"Sensory overload. I can get stressed due to loud noises and/or bright light, but I haven't ever had a public meltdown due to it (usually going to a quiet corner tends to help, plus meds for panic attacks if it is **truly** severe)."
"- Discomfort/pain when trying to look someone in the eye.

I can look people in the eye just fine, I just don't get the point of it. If I force myself to stare at someone's eyes I suppose there's some feeling of weirdness/awkwardness because I'm used to watching for expressions the rest of the face is making, but outside that...

- Physical texture of stuff

Taste and sound texture can bother me, but the way things actually feel alone doesn't bother me at all. As long as it's not covering my arms / neck and doesn't have any tags, I don't really care the fabric. (Except those workout shirts that cling to every part of your skin...)

- Hand flappies 

My brother does it. People online in videos do it. I just shake my foot/play with my hair. If I'm really bothered I suppose I shake my hand/s side to side but... I don't  hand flap.

- Genius Superpower

I mean... When I was a kid, like all kids, I was very susceptible to education and adaptation. This generally translates to ""genius IQ."" I learn quickly and get bored easily. This is a fact that persists now. When I hyperfocus it can really *seem* like I'm a genius, as a matter of fact I once had a test done that put me in the ""Genius"" category with 115-120 (when I was a teen.) But after being overwhelmed during my IQ test for my diagnosis (at 28 Y/O) it was bordering the lowest possible norm - (90).

 - plain food

Love spices. I have texture issues for some foods but for the most part I even like onions and pickles.


That's all I can think of that I can't contradict myself with counter examples..."
"From what I can list on top of my head, I've learnt which each facial expression is associated with what emotion and have little struggle to recognised them if they're obvious enough, I'm much more into habits and repetitive stimming rather than routine on the ""repetitive actions"" side, I'm not super knowledgable about every single one of my special interests, and some of my sensories issues got better over time (for example, I used to not be able to wear jeans at all but now I can). Also I'm not sure if it's related but I also rarely relate on masking disscutions because I really struggle to mask at all."
"Having restricted interests for a long time. I tend to get extremely interested in something for a while, then completely lose interest as if a switch clicks off. Then I can't remember why I was interested in that topic! When people continue to send me things related to that interest I often can't understand why they are doing it, because my interest in that ended months/years ago.

I have to stop myself getting annoyed with people who are still going on about the same old interest for years. Move on. lol."

I can’t stand any animals so don’t understand the autistic love affair with them.
"I've got a good sense of humor. The only jokes I don't get are ones involving subjects I know nothing about.

When I was younger, though, I sometimes had trouble with puns. For example, there's a scene in ""Yellow Submarine"" where the titular submarine's engine goes out. ""Maybe we should call a road service,"" says John. ""Can't,"" says Paul, ""no road."" Then Ringo says, ""And we're not sub-scribers,"" which makes the other three Beatles groan. It wasn't until recently I got the pun."
I don’t “mask” or “stim”. I’m also not a fussy eater or have meltdowns.
"Going nonverbal. I got hooked with the polar opposite: hyperverbal autism. I even consider myself an extrovert

I'm not sensory sensitive in regards to taste at all. In fact, I consider myself someone with a diverse taste. The one thing that I'll refuse to eat without their state being altered heavily because of sensory problems are melons and tomatoes.

I have a grasp on sarcasm and humor that passes neurotypical standards

I'm undersensitive to smells. I often cannot smell as much as the neurotypical people around me. I can only smell the candles I buy if I'm in a closed room and not near any ventilation.

I love small talk and hate deeper conversation. Often times, small talk follows a script I understand and follow well, but deeper conversation feels like uncharted territory and scary"
"I'm not verbal by choice, I speak as little as possible, non verbals are usually not by choice I heard."
"Academics, I’ve always been super bad at math and science. I feel like people expect autistic people to be super duper smart but I’ve never really excelled in school. I don’t mind though"
Movie Theater Too Loud
"Lack of imagination! 

I am a writer, I am a dungeon master, I have a passion for world building. I love to tell stories!"
"I’m not a picky eater in the sense of disliking many foods. I love trying new foods, I’m a huge foodie. I don’t mind when my foods touch. I actually enjoy mixing my foods together. I do have same foods and hyper fixate on certain foods for long periods of time. I can eat the same food or snack for extended periods of time without getting sick of it. My school snack was the same for years. A lot of the time, when I want to eat a specific food or meal and can’t, I don’t want to eat at all and meltdown. I can maintain eye contact, although I’d rather not. It doesn’t make me crawl out of my skin. It’s not this big thing that I can never do. I can keep conversations going and engage in small talk when necessary, although it does make me quite uncomfortable. I’m also not the best at it. I plan meticulously, but not always. I can be spontaneous, likely due to my ADHD. I do not care more about dinosaurs than the average person, nor do I obsess over trains. I do not have the inability to understand sarcasm. I am very sarcastic myself. My sensory issues are the most severe with clothes and smells. I do not experience the level of sound sensitivity that many Autistics do, although I definitely do still experience it. I’m good at reading people and situations, likely due to trauma. If someone says something and means another, I oftentimes pick up on what they’re trying to say, but not always. Direct communication is something I’ll always prefer. I’m not really routine based at all. I have little routines I follow daily, but I would hate for my entire day to revolve around the same routines. That’s also likely due to my ADHD. If my small routines change, my level of distress depends on what has changed and how different things are. I have the ability to form close friendships and maintain them, even though that definitely is difficult for me. I don’t maintain friendships or prioritize them in the way people who aren’t Autistic do, especially since I’ve started unmasking. I have very high amounts of empathy, but my empathy varies. I struggle to empathize with people in specific situations, especially if I cannot relate to them or see their struggles as minor or first world problems. I hate weighted blankets, hugs, etc. especially when I’m in distress. It does not help me calm down at all. If anything, it will make my meltdowns worse. A lot of people automatically assume that all Autistic people have a learning disability. I’m concerned twice exceptional. As a child, I was considered by those around me, mainly by teachers, to be incredibly gifted in reading and writing. I very much dislike math, coding, computers, all of those things do not fascinate me in the slightest. If I can think of anything else, I’ll edit my comment."
I struggle with direct communication. I read into what people say (not always accurate) and am often uncomfortable directly saying things
"I don't have any special interest. I'm very interested in almost every topic, and never had one topic that would really overshadow everything."
"I absolutely LOVED imaginative play and fiction as a child! It’s still pretty nice now, I enjoy a good roleplay from time to time. Eye contact isn’t too big of a deal to me either, I just can’t concentrate as well while looking at someone in the face."
I’ve always had good friends with common interests and my vibe check accuracy is honestly higher than that of most neurotypicals.
Not having a special interest (That I know of)/feeling the need to infodump
i like small talk. It's easy and formulaic and a good way to connect with other people
"I make eye contact fairly comfortably (unless my social battery is running low or I am overstimulated). I also don't have much of a problem talking to people I know about subjects I know, for example, I quite happily have a conversation in my college class with my fellow students and lecturer. Although, I don't find it so easy if it comes to someone I don't know and they are expecting me to do social chitchat.

I also don't really have meltdowns. I suppose I sometimes shutdown and say the most minimal thing possible to get by (I'm generally at home when I'm in this state) because my social battery is to low but I grew out of meltdowns in my mid teens years. I'm not sure why, I think my body just doesn't/can't act/express like that, I just seem to shut down. and not let anyone in."
"Reading the room and people’s feelings,
Im super good at that"
Complete mutism
"I love going to concerts! I love being in the crowd and feeling the bass vibrate. I know some people get overwhelmed being squished into a pit but that’s probably my favorite part. Being in a group of people all having the time of their lives. I met my best friend when she turned around, grabbed my hands, and we started singing Someone Like You by The Summer Set into each other’s faces.

And that was something that prevented me from getting diagnosed for a while because my therapist always said “autistic people are incapable of handling situations like that and you go to a new concert every other week”"
"Overstimulation, i just don’t experience it"
"Understanding others' emotions/reading them; I heard this was a common one for us

I don't rly struggle with reading people and emphasizing with their situations, good or bad. I'm also good at reading their body languages but not as good as I am with reading tone of voice or facial expressions. Only stuff related to that that I rly struggle to understand is when people beat around the bush or sugarcoat stuff they should just be direct about (e.g. saying ""look at the time/it's been fun"" when you really just want that person to leave you alone for the time being)."
"Melt downs. I have never had melt downs, even when I was a little kid. I have shut downs, which I didn't know were a thing until last year, but never had a melt down."
"i’m not a picky eater. i do dislike some textures, but not a lot of them"
"My comfort foods typically involve lots of spice and/or vegetables. too much junk food makes me sick, and food that isn't seasoned enough is unbearably boring."
"It seems to be a great effort to people on the spectrum, but I'm extremely comfortable masking. I just figure out how the person talks and talk like them lol. Then I do it with the next person. It's no more exhausting than any social interactions. It kinda just feels like lying, but not maliciously."
"I love being with people and being out and about with them. For some reason, a lot of autistic ppl are stereotyped as loving alone time and hating going out, especially with people. I like being alone, and I definitely cant stand ppl all the time (like rn, I’m in burnout), but I’m definitely an extrovert who loves body doubling for tasks that require me to leave the house!"
"I’m decent at social interactions. *Decent*. I can generally carry a conversation. Sometimes I get stuck and it’s just pure silence tho 😓

I don’t have a hard time making friends, I can make them easily. I just don’t *want* friends, so I never make them. 

I’m HORRIBLE at math. Horrible. But I’m amazing at science, especially biology. 

I can understand the meaning to sayings like “wears his heart on his sleeve.” Sarcasm I sometimes get stuck at but generally not because I’m very sarcastic in nature. 

That’s it. Goes to show it truly is a spectrum with so many different results"
"**Routine**. I mean, I have my comfort zone and I repeat things, eat the same food, listen to the same song... but I want to explore the world and routine is *hard to follow* for me. I want to try a new thing every day and make it special and **unpredictable**. I go with the flow pretty easy and because of the hard life I had, **I'm very adaptable**.


Pretty shocking for a diagnosed autistic eh? Ugh, actually I'm searching for ADHD diagnosis as well 😑"
"No real sensory issues, and I struggle a ton to be invested in special interests. 

I relate a lot more to the AuDHD ppl tho /shrug

That or I've masked a lot out of me"
"Selective mutism or difficulty with speaking. I’m extremely talkative, to a fault."
I don’t get sensory overload much at all (as far as i’m aware of)
"I'm able to tell the tone when someone is speaking (usually at least)

I also use a lot of facial expressions.

Also, bland foods aren't for me. I need a lot of spices, especially chili and garlic."
"I am terrible at spatial reasoning, and I don't think visually (in fact, I have aphantasia). 

I do not have any issues with public speaking, including making and maintaining eye contact. 

I have relatively few issues with socializing; I understand body language, humor, figurative language, facial expressions, and tone most of the time.

I didn't start having sensory issues until adulthood - and even then there's a chance that's more related to multiple head injuries than autism.

I didn't struggle in school at all - I graduated high school with a 4.2 GPA and college with a 3.8. I went on to get a Master's degree.

I don't need or use any kind of comfort objects (e.g., stuffed animals) or sensory stimuli (e.g., fidget toys)."
I don’t really like schedules telling me what to do
"I dont really stim a lot in the stereotypical way. My stim is hair twirling. I pull it, twist it, twirl it, knot it up. I do it much more when im bored or anxious. But i have never experienced hand flapping, rocking, or those types of stims. If i did as a child, I don't remember them"
"I don't have trouble reading emotions or body language, and I don't have any trouble understanding humor or figurative language."
"\- I am not a picky eater (I was before I was 20).  
\- I don't stim (I do have echolalia, which is sometimes listed as a stim)"
No food texture issue or overall pickiness
Obsessing over a special interest. I do but it changes every day
"I believe I’m rather adept at reading someone’s facial expressions and body language to accurately judge their reactions and mood… I just rarely know what to do with the information, almost like catching someone in a lie, what next?"
"masking. i’ve never been able to mask to the extent lots of people talk about. i script a lot, and im really good at it to the point where im able to work retail, but thats the extent to which my masking goes"
"Little spoons are trash. Bug spoons are goated. You get more food, and they are the size and shape of an actual mouth. I can't trust people who actively choose the little spoon. 

I said what I said."
"those chicken nuggets from the freezer and the TV dinner mac n cheese with elbow pasta.

I hate both and only like McDonald's nuggets and Kraft brand mac n cheese"
The idea of wearing earmuff style noise cancelling headphones to *reduce* sensory input when to me it's the equivalent of slamming my head in a car door.
I do not have a special interest
I understand sarcasm and irony.
I’m not sensitive to light
Being extroverted. I have no problem meeting and getting along with new people. And I talk a lot when I'm comfortable around them. My problem is sticking with them long term (I have friends but not like super duper close)
"being a picky eater because of textures, i can eat most anything except for gummies and jello, ...but i also cant eat anything thats cute or shaped like an animal, i cant eat chocolate rabbits or gummy bears or peeps or gummy worms or sour-patch kids without feeling sad and sick. goldfish crackers, teddy grahams, animal crackers, and animal-shaped cookies are okay but i dont really like them, i have no idea what that's about but thats more of an issue for me than texture-sensitivity with foods"
I like doing the dishes and I'm not a picky eater
"The concept of a ""safe food"" and the desire to eat the same meal every day.  There's plenty of foods that I like and I don't like to eat the same meal for more than a week, tops."
Being a picky eater. I'm not.
Planning everything out. I'm not organised at all.
"Also, I'm not sensitive and love irony."
"A very specific one is that I hear a lot of people groan about public transit and airplanes, but I love that stuff. In fact, air travel is one of my recently discovered special interests"
Low empathy for sure.
"My empathy level changes person to person if I care about them I tend to overreact of they get hurt because when I get hurt I brush it off til later but with them it's an immediate ""you need to get taken care of"" and they don't really understand"
I love bright colors. SO MUCH. I don't really get overwhelmed by visual stimuli other than stuff being too bright yknow
"I have no issues understanding metaphors and figures of speech; I use them a _lot_, myself!"
"Anti-Social, I started loving social interactions, going out etc. the last couple months. Even feeling lonely at times, although I was super introverted before my diagnosis. It's most likely has to do with the fact I can deal with my autism now and what it means for me and just go out and still be myself"
Knowing everything about your special interest. I never had much motivation to dive deep into my special interest like other people. I never felt like I really had one just because of that. This is a side of autism many people don’t talked about.
"just below this post was a meme about reacting badly to the sound Styrofoam makes, but I don't react that way. I can to other sounds tho"
Not understanding idioms. Like i doubt anyone would understand a lot of idioms upon hearing them for the first time but yk what it as after knowing what it means tf💀
I have quite a bit of empathy. And I don't stim noticeably so unless I tell people usually they don't know I'm autistic.
"Being shy/not good with conversations.  


I'm a diagnosed autistic and chatting with people and general socialization gives me SO much joy.

&#x200B;

so ya."
I have never gotten what stim boards do. To me they just look like some aesthetic thing (ya know with themes and all) not saying they don’t work just never understood them
"I didn't ""grow up autistic."" I wasn't diagnosed until I was 29 so I don't have any personal dislike for certain therapies we received as diagnosed children in the US. 

I don't know what occupational therapy is like. I've never been through ABA. I was ""just quirky"" and suffered internally, masking everything until I got home and would then explode (what we now know is a meltdown)."
"Special interests. I have things that I really enjoy, but it's not to special interest level."
"I don't really care about many food textures, also don't really mind if my food touches unless it's something sweet and savory"
"I'm very much an extrovert. I'm autistic + ADHD (both diagnosed, plus a load of other disorders) and my lack of social skills and hyperactivity manifest as excessive talking, disinhibition and talking too fast"
"Over stimulation.

Honestly, it's the under stimulation that gives me more problems.  I'm like the guy in the movie, ""The Accountant.""  I get it so bad that I stim pretty horribly, to the point where it gets bloody and leaves scars."
"I don’t know if anyone has said this yet, but I don’t take things literally or at face value. I can easily tell if someone is being sarcastic or making fun of me, and I don’t have issues with reading comprehension especially when it comes to songwriting and music lyrics."
"Special interest.
I may like a bunch of things- but I don’t usually spend my day obsessing over one specific interest I like."
"Masking / unmasking. I never thought about it until I was diagnosed. Stimming. Some of these things I 100% think NTs do too, so I can't understand why it's an autistic trait anyway"
"I'm not physically uncoordinated. I used to have awkward motor skills as a toddler until my mom put me in dance classes when I was 4 and I've been a dancer ever since, so coordination issues aren't something I deal with now"
"'Low empathy' or 'struggling with empathy'. I have always been very empathetic IRL and caring, I just 'stopped' doing that becuase bad experiences helping people."
Super introversion. My husband has that type of autism but I'm the excessively extraverted type.
"I thought that the ‘always thinks literally’ trait wasn’t something that I did because I’ve got a reasonably good grasp on sarcasm and metaphors and idioms, but I recently saw something that said ‘taking things literally’ is an autistic trait that a lot of autistic people take too literally lol and it apparently doesn’t mean you take literally everything literally 💀 (why aren’t diagnostic criteria written in a way more autistic people will find easy to understand?)"
Gender dysphoria
"I don't lack empathy, although I am sometimes baffled why someone feels a certain way about a situation or why feeling that way made them act a certain way, but I generally care that people are unhappy because I would like them to be happy.

I am an adventurous eater, and while there are a few things that will ruin a meal like raw tomatoes, soggy greens or salmon roe, I seek out new flavors, have diverse tastes from a world of cuisines and crave intense sensations like sipping Worcestershire and maple syrup, shooting cider vinegar, eating globs of horse radish and wasabi and gravitating towards cuisines that arent affraid of a spice rack like Indian, Mexican, Middle Eastern and Ethiopian. My best friend eats like she's ordering off the kids menu, so its hard to eat out adventurously, but I love cooking for two (cooking for one feels like a pain in the ass, but cooking for two is exactly the same amount of work and two people are happy) and she's really easy to cook for. Even when I do something complicated like French dip subs or Alfredo.

I don't have a monotone voice. People think I talk weird sometimes, and wonder ""where my accent is from"" in spite of being from the exact same place as them, but I have high and low tones in my voice and have been known to code-switch depending on who I am talking to and why"
i absolutely despise tiny spoons and tiny forks.
struggling with social interaction. I'm diagnosed but socialization has always been one of my biggest strengths
"Sarcasm: Oh, I definitely understand sarcasm and irony. In fact, I think one of my problems is that, deep down, I assume other people also are wrapping their true thoughts under layers of sarcasm. I also want to state that even though I don't really have a sense of humor, I'm not sure if it's the autism or our generation's humor being so far gone.

Sensory overload: I do experience it, but not in the same way others do. Instead of meltdowns, I feel like my mind tries to jump to other stimuli. Maybe it's just my AP Human Geography class, though. (Seriously, there's a girl in my class who is just pure hell on Earth.)

Special interests: Again, like with sensory overload, I feel like even though they are a thing, it's downplayed. Sure, I do have plenty of my interests, but I generally keep them to myself and only really open up if I feel like there's someone who'd also be interested. I used to, but I gained the ability to control it over time.

Routine: I used to have a hardcore time of when I had to have my three meals a day in by (8 AM for breakfast, 1 PM for lunch, & 7 PM for dinner), and while I still have these somewhere, it's less like the governing law and more like a personal preference, if one that I think actually makes sense in the long term. BUT I still have the Cinderella rule of being in bed before midnight. Back before I knew how the human body worked, I thought that my body would start a cannibalization process and that if I even missed out, my body would lie to me and send me into a death spiral."
"Sensory issues towards lights and stuff

I don't think I even stim

I hate routine and schedules, it burns me out. I lose interest and it just becomes stressful. Job and school suffered cause of it lol"
"Food aversion. I pretty much eat everything except eggs. That being said, texture is huge for me so if something is prepared improperly, I usually won’t finish it."
"Difficulty with understanding sarcasm/jokes, my other sibling who also has autism however takes everything literally"
"Strong sense of justice. I barely understand the concept, and don't understand revenge either. I see things as more like if someone does something wrong, they need to have some sort of remediation via teaching or punishment."
"I’m not really that picky when it comes to food. I only have a few ingredients I can’t stand. I’m always trying new things and flavors, just because. 

I don’t have a special interest?

I’m not very intelligent or gifted. 

I’m very well-spoken and communicate very well. People are often surprised that I’m autistic for this reason particularly. 

I’m not into musicals all that much."
"I do not have any communication issues, i easily strike conversations and can make friends quick"
"Good at eye contact, public speaking, and exhibiting empathy. Even my parents sometimes try to question my psychiatrist's assessment because I don't ""look"" like one hahaha"
When people offer you something it’s “common sense” to refuse bc they’re “just being polite”
"i dunno what counts / doesn't count as a stim (bounce legs, put my shirt's neck over my nose or bite it, move fingers in weird ways when i'm bored), but at least if what i do counts, i don't stim in the traditional sense, otherwise i think i tick all the boxes, some more than others!"
"I have trouble with some social cues, but it’s only face-to-face. Online or written down, I have no problems understanding sarcasm, metaphor, etc."
"Not being able to express with facial expressions. I'm pretty good expressing my own emotions through my facial expressions,it's reading other people's faces and verbally commination that I struggle with."
I can be quite good at reading body language (I think it stems from childhood trauma and always having to watch out for my parents reactions)
Obsessions and hyper focusing on random hobbies. I’ve never done that nor have I really jumped around as much as what was expected. I also actually enjoy talking to people and not just info dump. I learned how to talk to people in my early 20s so it’s a really good skill of mine now.
"I don’t remember going into a meltdown at all, except for maybe that one time where my sister talked while walking down the street. I realized that since she ain’t annoying me or teasing me and shit, it’s stupid for me to get mad at her, so I suppressed that anger."
"Not being diagnosed for a long time

I got diagnosed with autism at a year old and that really saved me from most of the trouble I've seen other autistics go through."
"Needing routine, I VEHEMENTLY hate routine and find it to be boring.

Also external meltdowns, I haven’t had one in years and I mostly experience internal meltdowns and burnout when overwhelmed.

PS: Even diagnosed people sometimes experience imposter syndrome. My diagnosis is so old that it was under the DSM-IV’s PDD umbrella, and yet I somehow struggle with imposter syndrome somewhat, despite consistently displaying some form of autistic traits throughout my childhood. Autism is a spectrum, so there are going to be a few traits that you will not experience.

Hope this helps!"
"Sensory issues. Definitely not as bad as others describe, plus I don't recall having them much growing up. They're problematic now, but like I said, I don't think it was a problem in the past.

I can understand body language 

I can read faces, it just might be kinda hard to understand the cause and effect (psychology is my special interest) 

Psychology, plus being a woman, makes me extremely observant with peoples behavioral patterns, tones, moods, etc. I'm always reading others, even though I don't somatically understand."
"Talking to other autistics it's not anywhere close to universal, but stays extremely stereotypical:    
    
Being great at remembering dates, numbers, phone numbers, statistics, anything to do with numbers. I've always been awful. On history tests I knew the exact order of events, but couldn't fill-in-the-blank the dates to save my life. It took me half a decade to memorize my partner's phone number. I wasn't 100% sure of my mom's birthday until I was in my early twenties.    
    
I'm also bad with names of both things and people, which is more common, but it includes even topics of special interests if there are no other visual cues. I got a C in Molecular Biology (even though I went on to work as a molecular biologist) because I knew the ""stories"" of how everything worked, but kept mixing up the names of proteins.    
    
Before anyone points it out, yeah, AuDHD can confirm."
I dont fit in with the others with early diagnosis feelings (despite being diagnosed at 6/7) because it wasn't explained to me until i did my own research a decade later but i dont fit in with the later diagnosis people because i never had to fight for my diagnosis.
"It's a spectrum so plenty of stuff. Like the loud noises being unbearable, I mean if it isn't ear rape then I'm fine. I also haven't had many shutdowns in my life, meltdowns though are something I've dealt with all my life. I've seen others post about not liking the feeling of showers and I absolutely love them, I'm what my mom calls a water dog, I just like being in water in general. Now with how I react to touching it's odd. Well maybe not that odd, being poked and prodded at can causes extreme overwhelming sensations and either makes me get extremely mad or run away. Hugging and all other stuff is fine though, even punches feel better than being poked. I used to hate so many textures for foods, something I'm kind of curious about is if others on the spectrum have noticed that taste and textures being gross or unbearable changes (not disappear, but it can if that's something you experienced, kind just change in general). Like I used to hate mashed potatoes but now I love them, I still hate tomatoes though, so slimy."
"Ive always been a very empathetic person, probably because of the amount of trauma ive experienced"
"The whole social anxiety/eye contact thing. Most people only notice that I'm relatively more forward then another person but not outright ""that person's autistic."" Beyond that I also find myself enjoying being at the center of attention."
"From what I've seen online, self-hate. I have never experienced it."
"*Not liking/feeling the need to have friends or relationships.*
I'm absolutely terrible at making & keeping friends (severe social anxiety), but I constantly feel extremely lonely and it makes me really depressed when I don't have anyone around. Being an extrovert with social anxiety really sucks.

*Being super knowledgeable/spending a lot of time talking about special interests.*
Maybe this is a social anxiety thing but I pretty much never talk about my interests, special or not. Like I just know that people aren't interested so why bore them with any information I may have? And I also don't have a tonne of information available in my head about my special interests, like I love spending time taking part in/learning about them, but most of it goes in one ear and out the other 😅 

*Having low empathy.*
My empathy levels are sky high. If I see someone (human or otherwise) hurting or crying I will more often than not feel physical pain & start tearing up as well. If anything my empathy is heightened, my family and friends always think I care too much."
Stimming
"I’m not an introvert. At all. I’m a bubbly extrovert who very much LIKES connecting with people, I’m just awkward as fuck and don’t know what’s going on."
"Self Infantilization, aversion to new foods, and hangups over silverware."
"as far as i know, i don't ""shutdown"""
"Hating small talk. I actually seem to miss the “social cues” more often in those honest, meaningful conversations that autistics seem to love. Especially with other autistic people!"
"No difficulty with eye contact, no physical stimming, I'll eat anything that doesn't manage to eat me first, no difficulty with unfamiliar places, no difficulty with driving, heaps of affective (even if relatively shit cognitive) empathy."
my empathy tends to fluctuate
"90% of the time I completely understand people who don't say exactly what they mean, it just feels wrong to react in an ""acceptable"" way. It's not exactly that but I don't know how else to describe it. Sometimes I have the instinct to play up the fact that the thing they said was a bit difficult for me to understand or that I recognise is not completely straightforward, giving the impression that I don't understand at all. This kind of thing also happens during more serious conversations and it's annoying. Maybe I'm an underrated comedian. Maybe I'm an insensitive, attention-seeking asshole who's ""tricking people into thinking I'm more autistic than I actually am"" (that's just my imposter syndrome talking)."
to be honest… i don’t have meltdowns. i never have
"The problem with empathy is they don't have any and are unaware of it, and we have infinite bandwidth for it. 

As always, specific individuals, NT or not, are outside of my observed norm, but given the others feedback here its probably not just my observed norm.

 I have already though through all the possibly outcomes in every social situation I am in, and they don't even begin thinking about them until after they happen. Most NT are completely unaware, starting with their own skin. The classic problem of the unexamined life."
"Clothes textures just never bothered me. Even tags in shirts, I was always fine with them.

Although I do on occasion get sensory overload from certain annoying things, I've found that I really enjoy very dense, loud, noisy music. [Here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKszjJpvByA). An autistic friend of mine says they can't stand this kind of music."
No eye contact. I make far too much
I don't know if I've ever had a meltdown
"I thrive on spontaneous decisions and schedules, last minute decisions make things better and more fun for me"
"I don't need subtitles, I actually hate subtitles and I don't seem to have an auditory processing disorder"
"People usually group autism with either ""very autistic"" or ""someone with sensory issues"" and thats annoying to me. They assume that I only have issues with noise and such because I front as being ""normal"" to them, but in my head I'm actually in a living hell, with every single noise and texture and feeling driving me crazy and no one seems to understand"
"eye contact can be so hit or miss for me. sometimes i'm good with it, sometimes i'm not.

i've also heard a lot about how autistic people aren't creative and I've never related to that. creativity is one of my strongest traits, I think!"
i’m not a picky eater. i’ll eat anything and i don’t really care if the foods touch
"Im very creative. I have heard that my creativity is the same as that from a child. Imagining things and laugh about it. Very good imagination. Been told that autistics struggle with that

I’m also good at talking.
But everything is said with that.
Good at talking but not good at a conversation…"
I don't like plushies
"I don't relate to masking because I'm unable to do so, the closest to it that I can is either shutting up or making extraordinarily minimal speech/responses. Other than that, it's immediately clear that I'm different from the first moment that someone sees me"
"Struggling with food, I'll eat anything lol

Also having a low/'flat' level of expressiveness (for both tone of voice and body language/gesturing I'm pretty animated a lot of the time)"
"I’m horrible with schedules. While I have no problem with stuff like appointments I can’t follow regular routines. 

If it’s a one time thing, no problem but if it’s regular I’ll probably never do it or I’ll be incredibly stressed by it"
"Stimming/fidgeting, it just isn’t a thing I’ve ever done"
"I don’t really have safe foods, more i pick a favorite food of the week and I eat that food a lot but I’m happy to eat other things. Also special interests, i more so have interests and i hyperfixate on certain aspects of them"
"Forgot to add losing speech momentarily, meltdowns, shutdowns and high emotional empathy with low cognitive empathy (in fact I have high cognitive empathy and low emotional empathy)"
"A lot of the ""stereotypical"" categories that the main diagnoses check for don't really apply to me...

I understand humour, body language, facial expressions etc

What I **HATE** is being told what to do. I like autonomy, and I feel I fall into more of the ""**PDA**"" category...

Like school REALLY wasn't it for me - too busy, loud, noisy - all I wanted to do was make music!

Sadly, this wasn't understood by many at all (therapists, teachers - even the SEND was puzzled as to why I couldn't get on - they said I looked fine on the outside). **EXCUSE ME**, there is a thing called ***MASKING***!

Anyways, I am much happier now :)"
"Haveing one consistent super intense hyperfixation, I have like 3 currently (pokemon, crochet and monster high), eventually they will put on the back burner and I'll focus on something else like sharks but I always come back to them."
"I don't remember a lot of facts/know a lot about my special interests (by my own measure and compared to other autistics I've met, although others sometimes get the false impression that i do, since my interests are pretty obscure and most know very little about them). I also usually don't talk/""infodump"" about them and don't enjoy it that much. I think that's mostly due to anxiety, low self-esteem/self doubt and impostor syndrome. I do it more with the rare people I'm close to/comfortable with (which is only one person so far). I do research them a lot though. I don't have issues with food utensils (like all the memes about spoons, forks etc), besides wooden ones (gross texture). I also don't ""recognize small changes in people's appearance"" (this is a common one in online tests as far as I've noticed), because observing people tends to make them observe/look at me which makes me uncomfortable, so i avoid looking at people in general. I do tend to notice small changes in a situation (another common format of this question) though"
"a lot. I'm like a weird case where psychiatrists and particularly bullies can single out immediately that i'm autistic if i'm in a five mile radius and I am personally aware of the autism, but I don't relate much to other autistic people (mostly also because my ADHD is a bulldozer so my autistic traits are all basically just extra seasoning to the ADHD).

I'm very expressive vocally, I use my voice a lot to convey things, I absolutely abhor routine, and I don't really have any issues understanding humour, puns, metaphors, or any other stuff like that. I'm actually pretty good at that. I miss tone online often, but that's more a symptom of text.

I'm also not empathetic. I feel a lot of posts by autistic people are about how autistic people are actually hyperempathetic, in contrast to the stereotype, and well, I'm the stereotype. I don't have any empathy unless you're some sort of arthropods (can't squash flies without crying unless i'm raging) or a plushie.

I also don't really meltdown too often. I had a meltdown over me accidentally messing up my KDE and discovering they changed the settings layout, but usually i'm pretty sturdy to stuff like sudden changes or things being wrong, I'm mostly mildly annoyed if I react at all. 

I'm also too good at making friends, I just can't keep a friendship. I can talk to anybody even complete strangers out on the street without issue. I go to a pride parade and go home with 10 new numbers and a guilty feeling knowing I will never be able to maintain those friendships.

I also don't experience pain from most sensory issues (some loud noises are hella painful but most of them don't cause me pain), it's more they make me gradually more anxious and stressed.

The autistic traits are there (t-rex arms, no volume control, my face is either laughing or RBF, I'm the pickiest eater you will ever know and I will eat the same thing for months without ever getting bored, I even poisoned myself this way once on chocolate, a slight of alexithymia is there probably, I toe walk and drag my feet and otherwise have issues coordinating my feet, I walk really weirdly, I cannot work in supermarkets bc sensory issues.. probably more I can't think of rn)"
"Noise-cancelling headphones. For me they just replace the outside noises with hearing my own blood rushing, which triggers my misophonia. I also just hate having anything around my head"
The whole lack of empathy thing. My emotions are constantly so intense and I feel other people’s emotions easily. As soon as someone is tense my body starts feeling weird and I get frustrated. As soon as someone’s happy I get excited. I feel it all and it can be really difficult to turn off sometimes.
not being good at small talk. im actually super good at it and i find it very easy to do
I don't often have meltdowns
"I don’t have a monotone voice, my voice is usually expressive but sometimes I can’t control the tone of my voice"
"Having low empathy, I feel and understand others' emotions so deeply that it hurts sometimes, same with my own emotions"
"I don't stay in my room all day, I am extremely extrovert (Which could be due to the ADHD). 

I also love metaphors, I use them constantly and usually it helps me to both understand things and explain things to others. AND I am an EXTREME empath."
"I dont have hyper empathy, wich lot of autistic people seem to have. I have very low empathy and cant emphatize even with my closest friends. 

And I'm not really introvert/asocial, I'm extrovert and need people around me almost constantly, I hate being alone, it feels so sad and boring."
"I’m not good with coding or whatever, and I don’t focus my energy on a small array of things.
My dad does though, and we’re both autistic. But i’m Adhd comorbid."
"Being very specific about food. The only food that I absolutely cannot tolerate is melon, the smell literally has me gagging. But I love going out to restaurants and ordering a fixed menu where you can't choose the food because I adore discovering new foods and flavor combinations."
"I got voted most sarcastic in my yearbook, so that? I also find humour and jokes pretty easy to understand, but apparently I process it in a very mechanical way whatever that means."
I can usually understand sarcasm pretty well.
Social settings. I’ve always been fine in them because I’m also extremely extroverted. Eye contact as well but I think that’s because my parents drilled it into my head at such a young age
"Well, to start my parents were/are comedians, so I'm usually good at picking up on sarcasm (but not always).

I have no preference between people who are autistic and people who aren't. I've met horribly toxic, manipulative autistic people and amazingly kind, wonderful autistic people. Same with non-autistic people. My only preference is for kind, trustworthy people in general :)

I get really depressed if I have no social contact for a period of time. Although I've come to believe based on my experience working with a lot of autistic people over the years that this is a common experience. I think we crave social interaction almost as much (or maybe as much) as NT people, but we both struggle to have successful social interactions and become easily overwhelmed or exhausted by it."
"My special interests aren't that special. Since childhood, I can't memorise too much about one thing like I used to."
"Being very picky about food. It's my policy that there's no such thing as bad ingredients, only bad cooks."
"Special interests - I don't think I get them. Sure there are topics I really love, probably more than NTs, but I don't really participate in them often - not even just for fun rather than learning and research. At least I don't get them in the conventional way"
"I rarely experience meltdowns/shutdowns, or even sensory overload. It's been really hard dealing with imposter syndrome because of it"
I'm pretty good at judging humor :>
"Loud noises as a sensory issue. I’ve work in live audio for a few years and also been a musician since I was 11 so by some miracle I can actually tolerate most noisy environments. 

However Bright lights are hell and I’ve full on shut down because of over simulation from stage lighting. Also had to quit my only retail job ever after like 3 days because the harsh things overhead lighting was slowly driving me into am existential crisis."
"i’m not overstimulated by social events at all, and i’d reckon that I’m actually quite good at recognizing facial expressions and tone. 

I would go as far as to say that my social skills are my strong suit!"
My partner doesn't care about spoons.
"this is really specific, but i have no issues with my food touching really at all. i have other food things like safe foods, but yeah."
"Childish toys/stuffies,  trains, flamboyant fashion, homosexuality/asexuality,  anime, science fiction like star wars..."
"Masking. Unfortunately my autism is very prevalent when I easily have outbursts in public etc. Not severely autistic, or at least not enough to have people think/say “‘she’s’ (don’t assume my pronouns) autistic on a day-to-day basis! Unfortunately most females are not diagnosed at a young age. For me I believe that my autism was prevalent from an early age, and I think my support personnel (I have other existing disabilities) knew but wasn’t referred for an assessment until I was 16."
"I don't have a hard time talking to people in person, I can usually get pretty deep in someone's head if I want. If I can get someone talking face to face no corner of their brain is safe from my powers! But if someone calls me on the phone I have a panic attack."
"I seem to have a better sense of humour than most people in my autism group. 

Like I struggle with strangers but if I know someone I can tell they are joking.

My boyfriend learnt the hard way that you need a sense of humour when you are dealing with my mum. Half of what comes out of her mouth are jokes and a lot of them at someone's expense."
The whole special interest thing
"I don’t have issues understanding metaphors and abstract thinking, and I’m not a picky eater. In fact, I actively hate eating the same thing too many times in a row."
Being so in depth with your special interests that you know things that are way too complicated or doing over the top and spending THOUSANDS on it. I LOVE resident evil but still piecing the story together also haven’t got all the games cause money is an actual setback.
"Sensory overload and jokes. I, in fact, love jokes and wordplays. I joke a lot"
"I'm no longer a picky eater, I mean there are some foods I'm not a big fan of but I'll eat almost anything on a good day"
I have no trouble understanding sarcasm and don't take things literally. I'm not a black and white thinker. I can usually figure out someone's emotions from tone of voice (though I do struggle sometimes to read facial expressions). I've never had restricted eating.
"I can understand how men work, kinda? I love makeup and fashion, so I’m fairly attractive and can be charmingly flirty when I want to be, but only certain kinds of people. Women is a whole different story, though."
"I don't have a singular special interest that stays and that I know everything about. I feel like autistic people commonly have that one/two things that are their special interests, but for me they change over the course of months."
I HATE CHEESE I feel like it’s a common thing that all autistic safe foods are like Mac and cheese cheese quesadilla grilled cheese ect but that is nasty but I lovee me some grilled fajita meat 😍
"I don’t get overwhelmed every second of the day, I can recognize an angry face, I can talk, I like jeans, don’t find the “””R-word””” offensive unlike most of this sub"
"dx at 13; cannot for the life of me keep a routine/have a routine. that said, i do believe i have adhd as well so that’s likely contributing"
I don’t mind loud noises
"The t-rex arms thing. I have never done this, and i dont understand why people believe that every autistic person does it, or that if you do it then you are automatically autistic"
Sensory overload. I used to struggle with this when I was a little kid but it's not really an issue for me as much anymore. I've learned to cope with loud noises and crowds of people.
I don’t struggle to understand fiction - but I do struggle to play make believe with my kids / the kids I work with (I’m a TA in an infant school)
I don't really have that much trouble making eye contact when I'm talking to someone
"...\*""NERD CULTURE""\*, in particular."
"I wouldn't say I struggle with body language as a whole, but certainly read it differently and pick up on things NT's don't notice or ignore. I also can notice a lot and sense a change in the air, but can't always tell what it means or what it's prompting. It's like a smell you can't identify."
the gatekeeping with special interests. why tf wouldnt i want others to like what i like so we can talk all about it
"On autism diagnosis tests, they all seem to imply autistic people are uncomfortable with the phrase “I got you under my skin” which is something I’ve never even heard someone say irl and doesn’t make me feel any particular way lol. I guess maybe it has to do with autistic people generally not understanding turns of phrase but why that one specifically!"
"* I don’t have issues understanding idioms or metaphors, probably because I read a lot as a kid and got exposed to most of the ones people use in day-to-day life. I also think I pick up on most sarcasm.
* I don’t get overwhelmed by sensory things. The closest thing I have to this is being a picky eater. I’m hy*po*sensitive, which is also an autism symptom. I don’t notice sensory things as much, so I can wear basically any clothing that fits without a problem.
* I don’t have trouble making eye contact. I don’t know if I do it enough or too much, and I don’t value eye contact personally, but I don’t experience any discomfort when making eye contact.
* Don’t *think* I have meltdowns.
* I don’t *think* I stim."
"I'm not good at clearly written schedules. I can stay on one for about a couple days or so, but I'll eventually forget one thing and then drop it entirely"
"i’ve never really had trouble making friends. i do have trouble initiating friendships, but people tend to like me and i usually have a “best friend” wherever i am. i just don’t do the initiating. i do have trouble maintaining friendships longterm though. never more than 6 years or so before we stop keeping up."
i dont have problems with sensory stuff
"- infodumping
- confused by social cues
- confused by others tone
- special interests(i guess)
- discomfort from eye contact
- unable to tell tone from text
- discomfort from change
- stereotypical stimming
- being able to eat the same thing daily
- routine 
- plus more

I usually experience the opposite of these tbh"

"having a special interest. I dont have one, except for sharks, I know only a few shark facts."
I don't have food selectivity and I love physical activities
"Im not diagnosed, but one of my best friends is and he atarted talking really early and has generally been a very verbal person, which definetly helped some impostor syndrome about my own childhood haha"
"i don't know everything there is to know about autism and honestly i have issues understanding it myself most of the time (i do have a dx by a licensed psychologist tho). also i don't have a ""highened sense of justice""; i just don't like getting into trouble"
Not understanding sarcasm.  I’m super sarcastic and understand all of it. I love sarcasm
"Selective mutism and being really reserved

I almost never go silent. I tend towards meltdowns with rants and tirades rather than silence, almost 100% of the time. I'm introverted, but am capable of being outgoing (I work at an English conversation school in Japan and lead English Lounges, and have been teaching for 13 years). I even approach strange women on public transportation and start conversations with them, a strategy that has gotten me many dates and works much better for me than online dating!

But I'm actually diagnosed with PDD-NOS/mild Asperger's (at age 16), so I'm pretty sure I'm actually on the autism spectrum.

On this topic, whereas many ND people, especially aspies, are shy/nervous on the phone, I prefer the phone because it's faster and I don't feel compelled to spend AN HOUR typing up my reply, checking it, and re-checking it. Plus, the anxiety of getting an ambiguous reply from someone else causes me to ruminate and be anxious. It's much easier to clear up misunderstandings over the phone."
"I am diagnosed, but still have doubts about my diagnosis. Things that I don't have issues with are writing, understanding facial expressions, body language. I sometimes have issues with sarcasm, but it has to be done in a good way. A friend that I had was an excellent wit at sarcasm, and most of it went above my head."
"Routine. I really don’t have one strict routine and I don’t really need it, either. The only time I’m upset by sudden changes in plans are if I were excited for something and it doesn’t happen or if  I have to suddenly do something I really don’t want to (like going to the supermarkt)."
"I don’t have issues grasping sarcasm or jokes. I feel like I’m highly attuned to facial expressions and body language, though I can be confused by what they mean sometimes. I’m highly empathetic. I had no (known) developmental delays as a child."
"Well, alot but for starters I don't have a samefood and can't stand eating the same thing in a row twice. I also don't like infodumping about my special interests.

Also I have AuDhd instead of plain ol Autism, so some elements have be overwritten because of that."
I feel like I also don't have much issue understanding people's body language and tones. I do to a degree but not so much it's debilitating and mainly I think I have a hard time replicating it myself even though I can understand it. I have realized I don't sound/look the way I think I do to people even though I am trying to replicate what I have seen that I understand
"I feel exactly the same way as you. This was also the main reason why I was so confused when my psychiatrist told me I might have autism. 

I didn't understand why they thought I might have autism, as I thought people with autism couldn't understand tone of voice, facial expressions of others or had very low empathy for others, but I felt I had no trouble with these things.

After researching what autism actually is, I have come to realize that everyone experiences autism differently, and I have come to accept that I also have it."
"Body language and facial expressions are how I communicate and or even ""hear"" people most of the time. Though, I tend to trust people easily, so can't catch it when someone is faking it either. My language related skills are poor. I have cluttering or expressive language disorder. Video calls and masks have been terrible for my communication skills that were already poor to begin with."
"same for me!! i struggled with it as a child a lot more than my peers but i learned fairly quickly, especially with people i know fairly well i don't struggle much with understanding tone, facial expressions and sarcasm etc. though i'm not that good at detecting deliberate lies so i can be easily fooled at times (and many have taken advantage of that) but other than that when people present to me honestly i can usually gauge what they mean and how they feel. but as opposed to most other autistic cis women i absolutely suck at masking, i can't mimick what i understand of 'normal' human behavior at all. my social anxiety and adhd may contribute to this as well but i'm extremely socially awkward, it's like the harder i try the more i fail. and another funny thing is despite being able to read facial expressions pretty well it doesn't work the other way around. i have a very clear imagination but when i'm reading and there's a description of a facial expression, especially if it's not an overt one (something like 'her face looked solemn but hopeful') i have to rack my brain trying to imagine what that could look like and it really frustrates me when i can't picture what i'm reading in my head (which as you can imagine makes me a very slow reader, i absolutely love to read but it's also really hard for me at times for many different reasons and this is a big one)"
"I have been literally told I'm reading people minds. Obviously I'm not ""reading minds""

I have this thing, I realized I have it when i was something like 12-15, I don't remember exactly when but i vividly remember the place and the situation where it first happened, it was like something clicked in my head

I sometimes become super aware of emotional context of peoples behavior, like I can read not what are they thinking but how are they thinking

It's like ""normal people"" process this subconsciously, and in my head it is for some reason wired to be a completely conscious process subjected to logical reasoning, like I have to actively think about what I'm perceiving, but when I do, it gets very detailed and very accurate, to the point I sometimes semi-predict what people want to say before they do

When i openly talk with friends letting them know what I perceive them ""thinking"", they often say my description of their thoughts is sometimes even more accurate than what they could come up with, I've been told I can help people understand their own thoughts even

And in context of autism i find that super super weird"
All of this. I'm also very good at masking most of the time.
This is all me too!!! Every single one.
"Yes! I’m undiagnosed but really struggle with black and white thinking. I have to know the reason/logic behind something. When that’s established, I’m all chill and flexible. I try to reassure my husband that I’m not trying to be confrontational, passive-aggressive, or standoffish; I just sometimes need to ask a lot of questions to make sure that I understand. He’s amazingly understanding."
I had to train myself on humor and metaphors because I felt like it meant I was dumb that I struggled with them. The end result is I'm now great at both lol
Same same same!!!!!
"i used to be pretty unaware of tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language as a child but nowadays i can read people almost as much as the average neurotypical can. 

i can understand figurative language and humor too, i even use sarcasm on a daily basis! 

these traits are highly associated with autism, because of this i often experience imposter syndrome and i feel out of place within these communities. 

however, i am quite awful at doing the body language myself. in that case, the neurotypicals are the ones who misinterpret it. also, one time i was speaking sarcastically and i think everyone else was in a bit of shock."
"This is meeeeee, hello friend.  ...Except the difficulty modulating my volume--I never know when I'm too loud or when I'm too quiet until someone tells me lmfao."
"Felt on the special interest thing. I obsess over things, sure, but I don't really possess the mental bandwidth to do any extensive information gathering or spend excessive amounts of time/money/energy on it. At most I'll zone out and daydream about the interest a lot. 

Also re: schedules, same. My brain dictates my schedule (for the most part) but the moment I put it to physical pen-and-paper planning it all falls apart lol. I wonder if that isn't related to the demand avoidance thing in some way."
Do you by chance have ADHD too? That sounds a lot like that combo.
"I think a common misconception with autism is that we’re good at keeping a schedule lol. It always seems to me that being in a schedule is GOOD for autistic people, and we find it less distressing to be in a strict schedule, but the diagnostic criteria doesn’t actually say anything about being GOOD at keeping a schedule."
I have both of those issues too
"I relate with this, then again I also have ADHD so that probably doesn't help things. I rotate a lot through interests, and even if one sticks, I don't really gain the sheer depth of knowledge other people can."
Yes!!! Like i LOVE ebola and read everything about it that i can over and over but can i repeat the facts and the science about it? Nope. But i still really am interested in it hahahaha
I feel you and I see you. I’ve learned to forgive myself for not being an expert on my special interest and to embrace accepting my ignorance in the pursuit of knowledge.
"Same!! I can't keep up a schedule, and I also don't know everything about my special interests. For example, one of my special interests is Taylor Swift. I don't memorise and know every single song in every single album. Sometimes, I think she isn't a special interest because of that, but she literally was a part of my childhood, and I do obsess over certain songs of hers."
"Same. I’m literally addicted to reading manga/manhwa/manhua but when someone asks me to tell them about it I can’t do it. The same happens when someone asks me about the plot of an anime or drama I’m watching. 

I keep track of everything with a website and currently I’ve completed 1154 manga and I’m reading 1619 that are ongoing. I’ve also watched over 200 anime. 

I’m incapable of info dumping because even though it’s all in my head I can’t explain it in words."
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.0446  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/83900)
This stereotype has always confused me because its also common to hyperfixate on fiction shows/games/books. Who even started saying that autistic people can't understand fiction? lol
"That’s amazing that you write high fantasy! I read a lot of it, and the amount of creativity it takes for that type of world-building is mind-boggling to me. Figuring out the cultures, languages, politics, magic systems, creatures and vegetation, topography…all of it is so impressive to me."
"Me too! I guess part of the appeal of worldbuilding to me, is that I get to research irl topic while also creating something new. One of my special interests is biology and evolutionary biology, and therefore I love speculative biology in fiction. I love linguistics, therefore I also love conlangs!! And you are in complete control of everything as well. You are the one dictating how society works, you don't have to learn ""social rules"" because you are making them up!!!

I do relate to ""not getting"" fiction still. I cannot get invested in stories set on our world that aren't Breaking Bad (that is the one exception. I don't know why). I read almost exclusively fantasy and I watch almost exclusively animated films (or documentaries, or scientific papers). I find that kind of ""realistic"" stories boring and pointless, I can't help it. You can literally create anything you want and you decide you want to recreate real life. I already have a ""real life"" I want DRAGONS!!"
"I don't have a problem understanding fiction. But as an aspiring creative writer, I feel like many things that are maybe common knowledge, or things that people should pick up an understanding of without really studying it, it just doesn't get stuck with me. So when I try to write something, I have to think really hard about the details, and still I don't feel like it comes out right. It's really disheartening. 

For example, in fantasy webnovels that I'm reading, people are often describing the appearance of characters by adding shapes to their nose, eyebrows, chin, face, their hairstyle and such. And I just have no idea how that would look, so I don't know what words to use when describing the appearance of things. 

When I read, I create an image of those things in my mind, but I'm never sure if it's anything close to how the author had imagined it. And I feel like there are people that creates images a lot more based on the details of the description, so I don't want to cheap out on them either. (ex. high nose, low chin, round nose - not sure if any of them are accurate, but things similar to that).

Similar problems when I have characters interact with each other, I can play out roughly how I want it to be in my mind, but when I try to put it down into words it just feels extremely awkward, sort of like I cannot capture the right emotions that I want to express.

Describing the surrounding layout is also difficult. I can imagine it in my head, but not quite find the right words to put it down on paper.

I'm also really bad with names. It's somewhat fine if the name is related to something else, but if I have to come up with a fully fictional name that has to sound in a certain way (to fit in with the theme of the story) I just come up completely blank. It's so frustrating how I'm so bad at one of the few things I'm actually interested in."
I write sci-fi!
"this is me too! i'm also a creative writer, and i write fantasy and scifi and really enjoy the worldbuilding process. fiction is my happy place."
"I am curious how common this actually is, I don’t recall ever hearing about it as a trait other than in diagnostic questionnaires.

I wonder whether it might be a case of conflating character motivations and appearances with comprehending fiction more generally. 

When a character in a fictional setting doesn’t act rationally, I mostly just find that frustrating and hard to relate to, and outside of the genres I enjoy, that seems to be quite common, so perhaps from a NT perspective we appear to struggle with fiction.

I also find it very difficult to picture what a character in a book might look like, even if the author spends a considerable amount of time describing them, so again, if someone’s criterium for “understanding fiction” is being able to imagine appearances, I would fail that."
Can you elaborate on not understanding fiction? I’m absolute lover of non fiction (media & books) and didn’t even like cartoons as a kid and have read maybe 1-2 fiction books by choice. Non fiction is exciting and fiction to be a bit boring. Not criticizing just emphasizing.
"wait fr? damn, i didn't know that .\_. def not true for me either"
"Yes OMG, if I have too much of the same food, I get bored and need to try something else."
"Even like people saying “I can’t stand my food touching”, my meals often resemble pig slop because I just don’t care."
"Another adventurous eater here! Food and cooking are almost special interests to me (they probably would be if I had the money to indulge), and I'm keen to try new things.

At the same time, some textures really put me off... and when I find a dish I really like I'm happy to have it five or six days a week. So there's a bit of classic autism mixed in there!"
"Same, I’m a sensory seeker. I have lots of common foods that I won’t eat, but many people are appalled by my favorite meals. I prioritize texture over flavor. Especially all of the textures that usually bother ASD folks- gooey and grainy. My parents call all of my meals ‘gruel’."
I also don’t relate to this at all
"I'm also similar to an extent. While I do have certain issues (Like I can't stand having food juice/water on my plate if it's not supposed to be there (so not like soup or cereal) and I have to drain/wipe it off or I can't eat it), I'm probably the least picky eater I know, there's few foods I don't like. But also, once I do find something I like at a restaurant, I rarely stray from it (sometimes I'll try something if they're doing a limited-time only thing), and my shopping trips usually involve buying the same things. I also don't care TOO much if foods are touching but I prefer if they aren't"
"I'm the same way unless the food is bland, I won't touch bland food."
"This! I was never a picky eater. I ate basically everything. We’re there things that I didn’t like? Of course, but I could count on one hand those things."
"Look, I’m into cooking and love to make myself things as because I’m autistic, other people *always* mess it up."
i think we might be twins lol
I prefer tasting menus in restaurants for that reason. I will shove most edible things into my mouth and enjoy them.
"I am tired of white people foods being seen as the only autism safe foods. I absolutely do have this symptom and I still love my culture’s food, which is spicy."
"Cooking and trying new recipes is one of my special interests! Both of my kids have ARFID (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder) due to their autism sensory issues, so I’ve seen first-hand how challenging eating can be for folks on the spectrum, and I’m extremely grateful it’s not something I struggle with personally."
"Haha, I wish that was me. I'm more picky of an eater than any of the autistic people in my life xD"
I am the same. I love food and new flavours however I do find myself eating the same thing everyday and at the same time.
God me too!
I'm also not a picky eater at all! I love discivering new kind of foods!
So much this.
"Omg I’m the same. However I don’t like dry foods? Crackers etc. I only like wet foods hahahaha (sauce is a food group I swear)
It sounds so bizarre"

"I was an EXTREME picky eater when I was a kid, but ever since I turned 18 I became the most adventurous person when it comes to food"
I agree only a few specific foods I don’t like otherwise I love trying new things :) if something is super chewy I will spit it out because I’m terrified of choking lol not necessarily the taste just fear LOL
I came here to say the same thing!  I love food and don’t care if it touches each other.
I don't relate to this either
"Same, neither of my kids who are also Autistic relate either.

I think it’s because I exposed them to a very wide range of diverse foods when they were very young. I only ever asked that they try it and if they didn’t like it I wouldn’t make it again. But that is a rare occurrence."
"Same!  The only thing with me is if there are multiple foods on my plate that often people would mix I won’t, I’ll eat everything separately one at a time.  I‘ll put sauce on pasta and dressing on salad and things like that but I won’t mix vegetables and meat or whatever starch I’m having."
Omg this! I love trying anything new!
Same here.
Same… but I will eat the same thing repeatedly.
Me eating the same pizza for 10+ years then I discover I'm allergic to tomato 🥲
Same!! I think part of the reason is my love of cooking and baking. I definitely have issues with some foods and especially drinks but overall it’s not much of an issue
"Same, I’ll eat pretty much anything (besides shellfish), and I really like finding new foods I like."
"I love trying different types of food, and I love touching them with my bare hands."
"I think I've been told ""you're so empathetic"" three times this week. It hurts to be around people or animals in pain, physical or emotional."
"I feel like I'm walking around with a raw nerve that's sensitive to everyone around it. A lot of that I know comes from being hypervigilant of my parents' emotions growing up, but I do very much feel in actual, physical pain if others around me are are upset. Almost to the point that I react more than the ones suffering! It sucks!"
"Same I’m quite empathetic. I don’t see it as a bad thing though.

But also sometimes I’ll unintentionally be rude to someone, and I think my empathy makes me feel even worse about it. Because I would hate to hurt someone and I’d hate for them to judge me as being rude."
"There’s cognitive empathy (understanding what another person is feeling) and affective empathy (feeling what another person is feeling), you can be high in one and low in the other."
Me too. My kids have huge emotional-regulation challenges so I’m constantly feeling the roller coaster of their feelings. It’s intense.
"Yeah, I kinda wonder if instead of being ""low empathy"", it's more of ""difficulty expressing empathy""."
Hello fellow hyper empathetic person! How’s the torture of existence treating you?
"Is low empathy a common autistic trait? I thought hyperempathy was more common, and “low empathy” was a NT stereotype based on our difficulty *reading* others’ emotions"
im empathetic to the point of it seriously negatively affecting my day-to-day life 🥴
"Hyper-empathy is equally common to low empathy, it’s strange that it doesn’t get as much attention. It’s physically painful the amount of empathy I have sometimes lol."
Meeeeee. I feel bad for toxic people CONSTANTLY 😂
Same! I think my plushies are upset because I don’t cuddle with them :(
"My understanding is that the cognitive empathy autistic people tend to lack includes things like imagining what other people would feel in a particular situation, and predicting what is likely to make them feel better or worse. The more common sense of feeling pain when seeing someone else in pain, or same with joy or similar strong feeling, is something autistic people seem to have in abundance in my experience."
I have a lot of empathy I just never know what to do with it I can tell what someone is feeling but never what I need to do
"SAME. I don’t get it. I do have times when I’m depressed when I’m pretty apathetic but I’ve been thankfully on the right meds for a long time so I haven’t felt like that in a long time. But even then, I always attributed it to depression. I’ve always been highly empathetic to the point of worrying even the slightest shift in tone means something is wrong. I hate it."
"The other day my wife said fuck this jacket when she was struggling to take it off. I proceeded to instantly feel extremely offended on behalf of the jacket my grandfather had gifted her and asked her if she really meant it. 😂 it sounds really dumb typing it out, but at the time I felt so emotional."
What's that like? I have cognitive empathy but absolutely no emotional empathy.
"Yep. I pick up on and absorb other peoples feelings on top of that, without being able to recognize my own (alexithymia). I also have mirror touch synesthesia so that's fun. Lol."
I strongly believe that a good majority of us have too much empathy.  I for one often shut it down because empathy will overwhelm me and process the feelings once I'm alone which probably to a narrow typical person looks like I am not empathetic at all.
To humans? I got no empathy outside my partner. Animals? Endless amounts of empathy
"Same here, has caused some major issues in feeling too much empathy for the wrong people and being taken advantage of because of it."
Yeah I have an over abundance of empathy. To the point where I get very upset when I see roadkill.
"Also way too empathetic, working on setting healthy boundaries."
"I don’t think low empathy is really a thing with autism, we’re all really high empathy but many of us express our emotions differently that the neurotypicals studying us don’t understand. For example they lable us as being selfish and not having any empathy towards them or their problems, and we’re selfish for “making the conversation about ourselves” but we’re actually sharing similar experiences so we can let them know we understand what they’re going through completely and we have a lot of empathy for them. We are super super sensitive to other people’s feelings, though we may not be able to express it, we can be very negatively impacted if someone in the room is not feeling we’ll because we feel their emotions so strongly. But we’ll just be seen as making it all about ourselves again for having being so sensitive and our mood being impacted and possibly having a shut down or melt down. We can try to say it’s because they are feeling down too but they’ll just see it as making it a out ourselves and being attention seekers. A lot of us have attachment and abandonment issues but again that’s seen as wanting to hog all of the attention to ourselves. I don’t think it’s us that have the empathy issues…"
"That’s not a thing.  It’s just a thing that NTs said about us because we just didn’t show empathy in the same way they did.  Additionally, there was a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6794557/) conducted about this and it turns out autistic people have even more empathy than NTs."
"i actually have a theory autistic people are more empathetic, we just often have trouble sharing or displaying that to our neurotypical peers"
Isn’t this just misinformation? We just process emotions differently
"Fun Fact: Its only a toxic stereotype that especially drives NPD to claim themselves or be misdiagnosed as ASD

Current science knows that autistics are natural hyper empaths, its just being fought by established institutions that benefit from loovas fascism"
But this one is just wrong. I don't think this is a true symptom of Autism. Just a stupid misconception.
"I’m so happy someone mentioned this! My therapist used to tell me “autistic people genuinely find it impossible to pick up on or relate to other people’s feelings, their brain prevents it from happening”."
I have low empathy for humans (I think) but I have extremely high empathy for animals. I also have dependency issues. It’s a mindfuck of a combination.
"100% agree. I’m way too empathetic and it effects my personal mood whenever I see something or someone in pain, sad, struggling, etc."
Seconded
"same, but my empathy is different. i cry over fish for an example, once i cried about fish being mistreated and my mum thought i was on drugs 💀💀"
I'm not diagnosed but I feel I have high empathy but not sure how to express that and I feel it comes off as low empathy
I have too much empathy. I hate it. I wish I had none sometimes. Lol
I swing wildly on empathy. I have ALL of it or none.
Me- crying over a video about a fictional dinosaur in Jurassic world for TWENTY MINUTES
Oh same I am SUPER good at “putting myself in other peoples shoes” and feeling what they’re feeling… it’s exhausting though
"I'm hugely empathic and it's hard sometimes, to go out the house, cos I'm always thinking about the people around me, that may not only empathy."
"CW: upset children

I called my mom crying the other night because the child in the upstairs unit was sobbing and screaming, saying ""mom where are you"" and ""I want a blanket"". My mom first said to just put my noise cancelling headphones on and tune it out, but I told her that I felt so guilty doing that, because what if this child is being abused? I can't just pretend it isn't going on. All I wanted to do was to soothe this child."
"I've heard both high and low empathy as stereotypes for us. 

I personally have low empathy. I still try to be moral, I have a strong sense of justice, and hate bigotry and those who cause pain. But I have to consciously stop and think about how others feel a lot of the time."

Omg yes. I have ADHD and am very excitable. People always think that the mask is the real me and when I unmask and unleash my energy- people think thats the performance. They always get it backwards 🙃
"Same, I am very expressive but it isn’t received well. I’ve been told I sound like a muppet and I’m constantly asked where I’m from. People sometimes think I’m foreign but it’s just my speaking pattern and formal language. I’ve heard others describe this experience as the ‘autism accent’."
"I'm very expressive, I think in part to cope with my challenges socially I went the other way and became like a cartoon, although sometimes I can be very none expressive .. I'm confused"
"I haven’t done it much since my late diagnosis made me aware of the amount of energy I’d wasted on masking, but for most of my life, the minute I spoke to someone outside of my family, I would automatically switch to what my sister calls my ""phone voice"" (which is funny because she totally does the same thing still !). It consisted in adopting a higher pitch that was also very articulate and much more expressive than usual, which in hindsight must have vaguely sounded as if I were auditioning to narrate an audiobook for young children. My natural voice actually tends to be very monotone… *unless* I’m Info-dumping onto some poor soul about my current special interest ! Then it gets even worse than my receptionist act."
"Yeah, apparently that's a result of masking."
"Same. I have chronic pain and a high pain tolerance, I don't understand people saying things hurt when it comes to, say, certain noises for example. It's uncomfortable, distressing, and sometimes causes a bit of panic but doesn't *hurt*."
"This makes me feel so much more valid in my sensory issues, as an undiagnosed person"
"I would describe it as distress is painful. Just like being excluded or abandoned is painful. It may not be a physical sensation you can pinpoint, but it’s the same receptors in the brain lighting up as they do for physical pain. It won’t make me saw ouch but it will make me cry."
"Yes, completely my expeirience! I have a high pain disorder called CRPS. I have learned to live with extremely high pain. I have sensory issues especially when it comes to noise and textures. I'm not sure how people describe it as pain. It's uncomfortable and sometimes distressing but definetly not painful."
"You see I thought that too but then I realized that my sensory issues actually do cause me quite a bit of physical pain. It's just that they won't cause me pain immediately but rather afterwards (usually when I come home but it depends) I'll get pain all over my body and also physical fatigue. And that can be even like hours late, like if I've been put of the house all day I'll be fine but the moment I get home that's when it all hits me and I feel physically like shit."
"Most of mine are just little annoying things that bother me so much that I can't peacefully sleep, like an annoying buzz or itch, but my brain is unable to filter it out. Only a handful are actually physically paifnul or unpleasant on the senses."
"I'm the same! It's incredibly uncomfortable and I hate it and want it to stop, but it doesn't hurt.
This is a large part of the reason I didn't think I was autistic until about a week ago. (I've been diagnosed for a few months now, but I'm still coming to terms with it)"
Same. I don’t have any sounds or textures that bother me
"To me some high pitched noises really feel like someone is scratching the inside of my ears with something sharp such as a knife. It's not the same kind of pain my IBS gives me, or hitting my toe, etc. I find most pains to be quite different from one another. high pitched noise will give me that one specific ""high pitched noise"" pain in the ears.  


Maybe you could compare it to the pain felt by your eyes when you look at a bright light too long (or even briefly depending on how sensitive you are to light). You're not hitting yourself with anything, but still it's not just unpleasant : it hurts really bad.

&#x200B;

Most of the time, though, it's just unpleasant or distressing, depending on the situation. Going outside is a guaranteed headache and oftentimes nausea. It sometimes mean getting hyperactive because I just NEED to get out, I know I'm starting to feel real bad about the situation. It sometimes just mean closing my eyes, applying pressure on it with my hands and shifting my weight on my feet in order to isolate myself to the world outside. It depends on the situation."
"Same, it doesn’t hurt but sensory no-nos just are uncomfortable to the point but being unable to ignore them."
"Sometimes they make my teeth feel itchy, especially my front 2...kinda weird but it's usually with noises and fabrics that I have trouble with"
It’s not so much a physical hurt it’s more of like a nagging feeling that you can’t get rid of like when socks are the wrong texture it feels like tinnitus. Though some do hurt like when people drive with their bright 500 megawatt light bars on it physically hurts my entire head and eyes.
"Yes! I don’t feel any physical pain or hurt. I think (I could be wrong) the part of the brain or something that registers sensations like sound is close to the part that perceives pain so some people do get physical pain- I will fact check this 

When i am over stimulated i feel so uncomfortable in my existence. Like physically uncomfortable, it is so hard to explain but it is awful because it’s not like a piece of clothing being uncomfortable and i can take it off, it’s my whole being

** Fact Check: Physical pain/ hurt usually occurs with sound because the centre in your brain where sound is perceived crosses over with where pain is perceived"
[deleted]
"Most of my sensory issues don’t register as pain, but are extremely difficult to ignore or filter out. Even when I do ‘ignore’ it (part of my masking for many years), it still seems to take a toll. Like I’ll get home from being out and just be absolutely exhausted, even if I didn’t do much or didn’t physically exert myself."
"This is me as well. I don’t really like eye contact with people I’m close to, but I don’t struggle with it"
"This for me too! Although I have the opposite problem. I don't know when I can look away. I find I understand better when I don't look at them. But when it's just one person, I 'stare into their eyes'... and make them uncomfortable 🙈🙈"
personally i don’t usually struggle with eye contact when i’m listening to someone. i only start to struggle when i’m trying to talk to someone else. looking into their eyes is too distracting and i’m not able to get my thoughts together
I’m actually the opposite (unless it’s an intimate partner). Eye contact feels almost sexually intimate so it’s something I can mask with strangers but I feel absolutely gross even trying to make eye contact with family members
"for me, i still struggle with both, but if it's someone i'm close to, i'm less likely to *notice* that i've been automatically making eye contact, when with strangers, i realize i'm doing it very quickly and freak out a little, trying to figure out where else to look that *isn't* their eyes"
im not sure if i struggle since i can make eye contact. its just really weird and intimate that i wanna look away as much as possible. maybe that's struggling?
*me* *too*
"Can relate.  I can make eye contact with five people, my mom, brother, fiance and two best friends.  Otherwise I'm garbage at it lol"
Can you give me that code? I need to use it in my software.
omg the last point happens to me a lot.
I have very good friendships (once I find the autistic people)
"same. except most of my friends are neurodivergent so that might be why my ""social deficits"" are less noticeable lol"
I do the same thing. People seemed to always like my personality.
"Same here! I feel very lucky to have a lot of friends who I care deeply about. It's not easy for me, but somehow I end up finding the right people who accept my awkward self.

People usually say they feel comfortable being themselves around me, and I think it's because I'm unapologetically weird and try to accommodate others as best as I can, so I guess I attract outsiders like me and end up making good friends."
I used to be like this but then I got bullied by one of my old fake friends and now im socially awkward :/
"I somehow keep ""stumbling into friendships"" too and now I have too many friends for my very limited amount of energy, but I feel bad because I don’t want to neglect anybody. 😭"
"My friend showed me this book, I've forgotten the name of it now but I'll ask her for it, but there were a number of symptoms in there that were shown not as diagnostic criteria, but as very common in many autistic individuals.
Reading through this thread is insane because of the number of these things I've recognised in this book and myself."
"I struggle a lot to make and maintain friendships, but people usually say I'm a people's person. It was the strangest feedback I've gotten.

I do try extra hard to maintain friendships and to connect with people when I meet or talk to them. I'm very aware of what I say, do, act, react, move my body, etc. every step of the way. I've figured out a formula and I stick to it.

It works best with people I already know or people who share my interest. At work, it takes a while to develop these relationships. I collect information about people so I know what to say when I talk to them next. So once I find the sweet spot, they feel at ease around me and I have their buy-in. It becomes much easier to interact with them, but I still struggle 1-to-1 because at some point I run out of time. There's only so much you can talk about with someone in more than 5 minutes (and I still use the information I collect and the questions I have prepared in advance). In group situations it's a bit easier, because I can pause and recharge while I listen (or pretend to listen) to other people talking, and, when I have the energy, collect information from others talking and then contribute to the conversation on the new topic. I gotta be fast though; sometimes by the time I have formulated what I want to say the topic of the conversation has changed and I'm not always sure how to insert or adapt my rehearsed line in there!

With people sharing my own interests it can be a bit easier, but it's also highly up to them how much they contribute, because I'm hyper aware that I can talk too much about it and make them uncomfortable."
Asocial* not anti-social
"This is very much like me, however I am in the process of getting assessed for autism at the moment. If I do get the formal diagnosis I will have AuDHD"
"Do you not go nonverbal, and do you feel like you word-vomit when under stress? The reason I ask is that you sound a lot like me and I'm actually hyperverbal instead of nonverbal. Maybe you are too if my questions feel relatable"
"I love my weighted blanket, but I am convinced I can feel when it is not completely even and straight on my bed. I spend a lot of time making it perfectly draped before using it"
SAME! I feel like I’m being completely trapped and held down and it is the worst thing ever
Same! Any kind of weight or pressure on my toes makes the joints in my feet feel bruised.
Weighted blankets are a complete no for me during summers. Just wearing a shirt makes me feel like taking it off along with all my skin so a weighted blanket is just submitting myself to hellfire on earth without the fire.
"Same here. It feels like I'm being crushed by something, and it makes me kind of panic."
same! they feel like one of those pull-string traps for catching animals.
"i have mixed feelings about mine tbh. i liked it at first, but it made me sweat a lot and i didn’t like that. i always have to make sure that my blankets and quilt are in the right place, so doing that with a heavy blanket isn’t easy 😭 it always made my knees ache because of heavy it was too, and i have bad knees anyway so that didn’t help. it was comfy to lay with, just not for a full night"
"I feel like I'm under boulder that is crashing me 😳 comeooon, it's damn 6kg!"
I get the same with clothing compression. I wear tight trousers for fashion (I know baggy ones are back in but they’re not for me) but I also feel like my legs are being constantly crushed and I wanna scrape them off
"It mostly seems to be a thing for a loud minority who probably didn't know they were diagnosed when they were younger and see their ""gifted kid"" status as an early sign of being a bit different. 

I think it's only a common thing in online discussions because it's a positive thing that people tend to proud of."
[deleted]
"I was 'intelligent but not gifted' and then there's my two years younger, gifted, neurotypical brother. I learned to read before primary school. He learned to read when I learned two read, two years younger in age. I was always kinda average in school, he skipped a class. He's an international student, self-sufficient, lots of scholarships, doing his PhD. I get stuck doing Bachelors degrees and taking double time for them, as well as being unable to earn enough money on my own.

It's slightly painful."
WHAT-
"Being ""gifted kid"" is not common. That's a misconception deriving from representation. In reality it's not different for autistic people that for NTs."
Same! My partner is the sort that loves to info dump and tell you everything he is currently obsessed over. I'm the opposite. I would much rather be researching and engaging in my special interests than talking about them.
I’m similar. I find it discussions much easier than infodumping and I’m aware that a person might not want to know everything ever about something so would rather they ask specific questions.
"For me it's just that I'm so frustrated I literally can't speak. It can feel like my throat is closing up, making it hard to push the air out to talk."
"edit: nonverbal and selective mutism sound very similar to each other. i don't know which is which anymore. i just know that i have selective mutism with my body refusing to generate words from time to time. 

~~i  think i've read at least 3 post here that you can't suddenly go ""non-verbal"", but i'm unsure. since nonverbal means that you just can't talk, as there's a severe disconnection between your word building and your brain.~~

~~while selective mutism means that you can't talk from time to time for some reason. it could be either caused by the autism or caused by another body function. i have that sometimes. I think I talk, but it turns out that nothing is coming out.~~"
"I usually dont have any Problems with speaking but there are Moments where i cant talk. Its as if my Mouth doesnt exist. The Words are in my Head, i know what to say but i cant. This often results in negativity and Problems that i could have avoided just by speaking.


Lucky it doesnt happen very often and i dont know what triggers it.


But besides that im really really far away from being a nonverbal Person."
"Personnally when I go non-verbal, it's like the HUGE desire to not say any word. 

It's a bit like if I didn't want to put my hand on a fire befause it seems useless. Same here. Talking seems not useful and I don't want to do it to the point I don't.
But if I force myself to talk, I will stutter a lot."
"I’m not sure if I’ve ever gone nonverbal from being overwhelmed. It definitely happens to me sometimes when I get a migraine…it’s called transient aphasia and it’s bizarre and frustrating. I think it gives me a tiny peek at what regular life must be like for my non-speaking autistic son, so in a way I’m grateful for the experience."
"Just as an FYI, I believe ""going mute"" is more appropriate as non-verbal refers to a permanent condition"
"Non-verbal and nonspeaking activists have asked that otherwise verbal people refrain from calling the situational loss of speech ""going nonverbal"". Being non-verbal is an always thing. It's no speech whatsoever, no words can be forced, they can't talk regardless of how happy or sad or angry they are. 

Other terms have been proposed; as I said above, speech loss is a good one, as well as verbal shutdown."
"You can't ""go nonverbal"".  Either you are or you're not. But you can be temporarily unable to talk, which is something totally different. The correct term would be ""having selective mutism"" and it's not something  specific to ASD (and can be a diagnosis on its own).

It's mostly related to anxiety, but I find that being overwhelmed either by my emotions or by my senses can simply prevent me from being able to talk.

I can think words fine. I can write fine. But my mouth refuses to make any sound. With deep concentration and energy put in I can sometimes pronounce one sentence, and I'm completely exhausted afterward."
I didn't understand it until my daughter started going non verbal. I get it now. It's a lot of internal shut down and anxiety.
"Took me almost 30 years to experience this first. It is hard to understand if you haven't. 

You might be familiar with the feeling of decision paralysis, it is a bit like that. It feels like the decision which word to say next or how to get a thought translated into words gets harder and harder until the effort and focus you try to put in suddenly spirals out of control and it feels like the part of your brain that works on this does an emergency shutdown and slowly restarts over the next hour(s). That's very roughly how post-experience me would explain it to pre-experience me.

Stay away from burnout and chances are you'll never experience it."
I appreciate the info y’all. I can’t say I relate but definitely good stuff to know.
"I am happy if you don't experience it. It's like the world falling over you, and you start to mix words and not being able to talk properly then you can't talk anymore, you can't even say yes or no. It's horrible."
"i've only ever gone nonverbal once, and in my experience, it was because i was just too anxious to get my words out. normally i can make myself talk through my anxiety, but in that moment i just couldn't, so i had to write on a paper because it was during a group project at school"
"> Going nonverbal.

For me this happens at work. I get too overwhelmed by people and sensory issues, and suddenly talking just costs too much energy."
"Sarcasm and Satire are things I'm very proficient in. I'm that annoying person that says ""did people really think that news article was real?"" I guess I was helped along by having an NT mum and siblings who spoke sarcasm like it was a second language. 

Neither my kids got my ability to spot sarcasm and satire although one is too young to understand it anyway. It's hard for me to remember they take things super literally."
I’m sarcastic and I love sarcasm but I do miss it a lot
"I love language, learning new phrases, new idioms, new urban phrases. (I work as an editor lol). I use sarcasm a lot, and try to insert idioms and memes into my language when I can. But I have been told before that when I am sarcastic, it sounds like I'm being serious...

I wasn't always like this though. But growing up I had a couple of friends who were really good at improvising replies and comebacks, so I made it my goal to be able to do that, because I hated the feeling of being spoken down to and not being able to quickly defend myself. I also noticed how popular they were and how it was easy for them to connect and make friends, and I wanted that too."
"this i think. like im horrible at describing words in general even if i know what they mean, but i can still describe and feel emotions just fine for the most part"
You're so lucky 😭😭😭
Same for me ! I would say I would be the total opposite of alexithymia. I have a really deep consciousness about every emotion I feel and I'm really aware of it. And that is since I'm a little child.
as a railroad employee I feel ambivalent about them I guess lol
"Same! I can't convincingly mask as NT anyway, though."
"Same, I don’t really feel any desire to fake myself. I also have next to zero desire to socialize IRL so I guess it’s just not important to me if others think I’m weird"
Masking is a NT thing anyway
"I didnt understand the appeal of trains until i stood on the side waiting for it to go by and i saw it in all its enormous glory, zooming by. Then i went on a train for the first time last year and it was genuinely phenomenal. A wonderful experience and its so calm and relaxing. 

I also had one of those old fischer price Geotrax train sets. Those were so cool."
"Haha, I know, nothing special about trains. airplanes, on the other hand…"
"Trains are meh. Cargo ships? I’m enamored. 

Like I realize cargo ships are boring. But I just feel something special when I’m around them."
"I was wondering if someone would say this. My nine year old autistic son LOVES going on trips, staying at other people’s houses, all of it. He’s spent the night in every room in our house just because he thinks it’s fun.

Sometimes if it is a long or draining trip he can have a couple of days needing to readjust. Does that happen with you as well?"
"Me too. I get restless if things stay the same for too long and I love ""playing it by ear."" I don't need everything to follow a strict schedule; what I actually need is for the plans I do make to not get changed last minute leaving me to bluescreen."
I like to be in control whenever things change.
"I have ADHD so I need a lot of change to avoid boredom. HOWEVER,  this is more in terms of how I do things rather than the schedule itself. For instance, I like to have a fruit and a coffee for breakfast every day. But I like experimenting with different fruits (not too keen on experimenting with different coffees/caffeine beverages though). I have lunch and dinner around same time every day; difficult for me to nudge those times, but I prefer having something different to eat every day.

It's also difficult for me to establish a new routine or re-establish an old one. I can deal with short-term changes, in fact I think I work well under pressure, but it takes me a while to adapt to long-term changes. If my current routine is disrupted, it's very difficult for me to 'get back on track', it's a slow process. Ivetgiven myself a lot of crap for it pre-diagnosis, I thought I was just not trying hard enough. For example, after I move homes it takes me months to unpack and establish myself. It took me a year to create an office space for myself in the spare room. When I come back from vacations, it takes me weeks or even a month or 2 to 'come back' to my life and routine, physically and mentally. I like vacations but they are such a stressful time for me, and I have to plan everything ahead of time as much as I can. Depending on others helps if they actually deliver, if they don't, well...

I would also feel so overwhelmed if I had to stay over at another person's house. Hotel rooms I can do since they are minimal and you can do pretty much whatever you want there. But otherwise I get so anxious. Even visiting another person's house for the first time, even for a few hours, can be anxiety inducing, especially at short notice. Overall I think it's much easier to deal with new things if you anticipate or plan for them."
"Lights and most noises have never bothered me. I do have some issues with temperature or getting wet, and with too many people talking at once. But my sensory issues seem fairly mild compared to most autistic experiences I've heard."
"First point made me chuckle. Moving to Germany was a relief in a way, bc I don’t need to be unnecessary nice to people here, lol"
I get this

"i used to do dinasaur hands but now i just bring my hands to that point and then they fiddle with each other the fiddling changes based on my vibes at the moment, like if stressed  my hands just cup eachother and my fingers wiggle around then i uncup them, repeat. i know it changes but i barley pay attention how my hands act since i do it unintentionally"
"i do “dinosaur arms” but more its grabbing my tshirt and pulling it away from myself at the bottom, if i dont idk what to do w my hands, also uncomfortable with my body but mostly bc idk what hands do"
"I LOVE loud music, concerts etc. My noise sensitivity kicks in when it's not noise I have ""planned"" for."
Im sort of like this!
"Stupid question, what's the difference between a meltdown and a shutdown? I'm not sure if I've ever had either of those so I'm curious. Sometimes I get insane decision paralysis sometimes (like if I'm trying to decide whether or not to go to a social event) and my brain just kind of stops and I just cry. Not sure if that's the same thing (I also have ADHD and anxiety so that might make it more confusing)."
They very often come together
"I can hyperfocus substantially, usually on the wrong thing according to everyone else I annoy with it, but I can also definitely struggle to focus on the right thing or indeed anything. 

Sometimes I focus on conversations taking place around me but I actually want to focus on the thing I'm trying to do but can't focus on !

I'm awaiting contact from a GP about adhd assessment, because autism on its own just wouldn't be enough 🙈"
In pretty sure I also have adhd and I'm pretty much always in a hyper focus. If I'm not then I'm just bored and have nothing to do
PROLONGED EYECONTACT
"Me too, I feel like I need to look at someone to listen actively. When I don't I feel like I start thinking about what they're saying halfway through their sentence instead of continuing to listen as they talk.

Sometimes I have to look away when people reciprocate eye contact too much though. I never really look away so if they don't either it feels kinda weird."
"Have you researched Gestalt Language Processors? Essentially, late speaking autistics can safely be assumed to be Gestalts. I don't want to info dump on you, but long story short, Gestalts are essentially masters of metaphor. Let me know if you want me to tell you more. You are spot on with the last paragraph, I believe."
TRUE
"I can't really taste when something is spicy.
Just my scalp gets a bit sweaty.

If it's REALLY spicy, my gut tells me, not my mouth. Also my eyelids feel sweaty.

Again not spicy on the way out either. Just ""in a hurry""."
Very spicy or very salty is common for autistics. I think I have a good selection of foods I will eat also. I also drink hot sauce...I'm sorry I know that is probably disgusting
Did you also grow out of shutdowns? Or do you not have those either?
"This, but what’s odd is most people can’t fully tell when I’m being sarcastic, but I also like to use sarcasm to gauge people’s personality."
"I'm pretty good at noticing sarcasm when speaking (unless someone is super deadpan serious), but through text is a whole other ballgame. I can never get jokes or sarcasm through text, especially if it's more formal."
videos of a bunch of forks and spoons or just a bunch of forks and spoons bunched together in a group not even a picture is the bane of my existence. didnt know this was an autistic trait lol
I think a lot of autistic people may be at risk of using drugs to cope with our world not being very easy to deal with. One thing I've noticed from my own observation is that many autistics have a strong sense of self-preservation. I think the anxiety we often live with is a big part of this. We see and understand risks. This is probably that strong sense of self-preservation.
"Same here! I still get upset by loud unexpected sounds still, but it doesn’t cause me a meltdown anymore."
I think a lot of people just adjust to existing in the world. Some people’s brains never update the software so to speak and continue to not be able to handle the sensory input but brain plasticity is pretty amazing.
I'm the same
Did you know even neurotypicals stim? Pen clicking and foot tapping are among the most common. You may have some subtle stims you don't even realize.
I think most like looking from the outside and knowing about the mechanics/engineering of them more than riding on them lol
"I once spent a 2 hour train journey in the connector between carriages because I didn't want to sit near someone or have someone sat next to me. Used my suitcase as a chair and stuck my headphones on. I hate any form of public transport, though, as I'm not in control of the vehicle."
Same here! I find hugs very comforting.
"Aw, this warms my icy little heart. You're kind."
"I can describe things verbally too! Im great at communication and saying how I feel and what I’d like to be better, but I have been told I sound like I follow a script and can be strict with how I communicate. I expect other people to be the same I think."
The reading into tones might actually be trauma and growing up around NTs (I don’t know if that’s true for you though) or the general influence NTs have. I’ve heard this from other autistics too
pretty avatar!!
"I also don't get stage fright! I find it funny that I have the world's lowest social battery known to man and have anxiety, yet I can perform and do public speaking."
"I can relate to not being able to retain information. I could learn about something for 8 hours but only be able to describe maybe 3 strong details about that thing that I found most interesting. 

It’s actually quite annoying."
I relate so much on the empathy thing!!! Seeing some of the top comments on this thread with some people claiming that all autistic people feel hyperempathetic made me feel bad because I don't and I know that a lot of us are the opposite!
I was concerned the title might be alienating! But I'm glad everyone seems to get the point :)
"I know the feeling. I would cry because even though I knew a rock wasn't alive, kicking it I imagined it was. It was definitely painful, I'd get mad and throw something and then freak out because I felt bad for it."
Same with me. I'm too aware of social cues and changes in people's behaviour
Are you me? What you've written pretty much describes me as well minus the part about lights
"Yes, that is the point of this thread!"
"you haven't met many dumb psychatrists/therapists, have you?"
"i tick p much every box on the diagnostic for my country, but diagnostic checkmarks vs experience and comorbid disorders are varying"
"Same, but I'm good with logical connections. I can connect two abstract ideas no problem, but just end me when it comes to tangrams, word searches, or ""complete the pattern"" puzzles."
"I love bass! Low rumbles and notes are my favorite, they just make me feel so happy and excited. I love feeling vibrations too. I play reeded instruments and feeling the vibrations in your body and on your lips is super fun, especially on the low notes."
"Could I ask about the hyper empathy? I have an autistic child 9M and he has always had hyper empathy. He cannot stand to see anyone upset or hurting but especially me. And if he’s done something he even thinks could have made me slightly unhappy he will start to come unglued. Do you have any thoughts of ways I could help him? I am constantly reassuring him I’m fine, but that boy can read me like a book even when I try to be stoic. Plus emotions are part of life, you know? I don’t want to shield him from all emotion but I also don’t want it to overwhelm him and I feel like I get the balancing act wrong every day."
"I think it's usually the other way around. Personally when I think I'm feeling imposter syndrome, I doubt my diagnosis and wonder if the psychiatrist made a mistake because I don't fit every autistic stereotype."
I never wanted to sound like a psychopath but I cannot understand why people care about animals so much
I looked up what a metaphor is and found out a metaphor is something that compares something without using the words like or as an idiom is a phrase that can't be can't be broken down should've paid more attention in English class
"True for me too. I am great at maths and physics, but I'm equally in love with psychology and understanding sociology."
"Oh wow, I love that! I wish there were ressources like that for adults aswell!"
I have good posture to the point of being rigid and I know that I am Autistic.
Why does it piss you off?
Also im shit with music even though i like it
"Concerts are so good! I personally love them sensory wise too since I think I'm hyposensitive to pressure, and loud bass fills that nicely."
"It’s weird because I’m also an aphant, yet I scored off the charts on the spatial reasoning part of the test. I think it was all the Tetris I played as a kid lol"
I'm also horrid at spacial reasoning and have aphantasia. I'm ass at geometry for a reason lol. Also I'm bad with understanding distance and size even with references.
Annie’s organic shells and cheese 🔥
"Same here. In fact, I'm more inclined to say that I have the opposite problem, that my mind interperets everything wrapped under more layers of sarcasm than needed."
So sorry to hear that.
Cheese changes texture drastically depending on it's temperature imo. That's the problem.
Feel that one. I'm a fucking shambles 😂
"so i wouldnt really consider it being a special interest, more like, having a favorite animal"
"There are cognitive theories of autism that state that autistic people think deliberately more often and others think intuitively more often. It is for instance IIRC part of Simon Baron-Cohen's theory of systemizing vs empathizing, (although it should be noted that his theories in general are not popular within the autistic community, and for good reason, but I do think it is worth mentioning that he noticed this difference and tried to incorporate it in his theory), and it is the cornerstone of the ""dual processing theory of autism"". Before I was diagnosed this was how I explained for myself what was different between me and others. However, there are some more recent studies that seem to disprove this, or probably at least that it is much more complex than just ""autistic people use deliberate thinking more and intuitive thinking less""."
"Autism is basically just a sensory processing disorder. And manifests in people being over and under sensitive in various senses.

Reading people is a sense, and it seems like you're hypersensitive to it."
That's 100% me too
"yep, can confirm, i have both and i love schedules and routine in theory but in practice i can't do 'em well at all :("
"I’m diagnosed with both and u/mighty_possum_king’s post describes me very well. It was definitely something that my imposter syndrome took hold of when I was seeking diagnoses and for a long while after, and I had trouble coming to terms with (both things)."
"haha yeah, i do. i was diagnosed with autism when i was 9 years old (asperger's at the time) and ADHD when i was 17, during my first year of college."
"Yeah, I always interpreted ""good at keeping a schedule"" as ""good at keeping routines"". I am terrible at getting to one-off appointments, and keeping up with spontaneous or short term plans even if I have some time to think beforehand. 

But I have done the exact same morning routine (from 5am-8a) since I was eleven, and if anything interrupts it my whole day is ruined. 

So, I'm good at keeping routines... because I'm unable to do anything if my routine is messed up. Haha."
"Now that I think about it, you are right."
"Yes, this is almost exactly how it is for me. I have a lot of things that interest me but cant stick with them for long or can't retain knowledge about them in the same way i've seen other people do."
"I do, actually. I have several alarm systems and reminders and still it's very hard."
"I *love* developing magic systems. I can spend *hours* at my whiteboard hashing things out. I developed a magic system for the Pokemon world (one of the Ranger games is an acid trip, there was either lost high technology or magic. I went with magic) and it was about 8-10,00 words lol. 

And god I love making cultures. For the same Pokemon project, I hashed out 30k of worldbuilding, about 20k of that being culture (the other 10k being the magic system). It's so time consuming but *so much fun*. 

I tend to avoid the politics part though. I'm *so bad* at politics."
"Yesss for linguistics and biology in fiction! I love Brandon Sanderson for this, because he creates such in-depth cultures but also does some weird biological world building. Terry Pratchett also talks a lot about speculative biology and frequently makes etymology jokes (although Sanderson and Pratchett don't use many conlangs)"
"yesssssss I made my own conlang for my Pokemon project. It's not very good. It's semi-functional which is all I need for a fanfic project. I'm a linguistics major actually lol! 

I don't worry so much about speculative biology personally. I just like ""It's magic, I ain't gotta explain *shit*"" when I have fun make fantasy world. Plus I don't tend to focus on environment personally. I'm more of a culture/religion/magic sorta person."
"Honestly a lot of the things you're worrying about are things most readers don't worry about. Most readers will fill in the gaps themselves. You don't need to go into excessive details about facial features or surroundings. Just give a basic description and move on. Most readers will absolutely create their own mental image (unless they have aphantasia or other similar problems). Usually a sentence or two of description is more than enough for a reader to work with. 

I can't really say anything about the character interactions though... I'm a slice of life writer so character interactions are my bread and butter. Then again, I don't feel like I'm *actually* the one writing. I describe myself as a Chaotic Evil Pantser because I'm at the *extreme* end of the plotter/pantser spectrum. I literally don't know what I'm going to write until it's down on paper (or tablet in my case). I might have a vague idea of what happens, but the characters will ultimately fill in what's going to happen in the scene. I'm also a psychological writer, so I really, *really* understand my characters. You should see some of my trope lists... They can be like 4-6 *pages* as a mix of canon-based tropes and ones that apply *only* to my interpretation of the character.

And yeah, names can be tough. One reason I'm more than happy to write fanfiction over original stuff: the characters come pre-named. Unless I need to introduce an OC for whatever reason (ie, fleshing out family for a character's backstory or, in a very specific case, introducing a midwife into the story). I have one fic where I just used Behind the Name's generator and named over 200 characters literally randomly. But most of these characters won't even get *name dropped*. Granted, the canon itself names characters without *any* regard for etymologies which frustrates me as a linguistics major."
"I think it comes from the stereotype of ""Autistic people have trouble understanding abstract ideas/concepts and prefer concrete facts."" Fiction and lot of its surrounding things can be pretty abstract like understanding character motivations, worldbuilding, and so on. I remember seeing a post similar to this in the Autistic women subreddit where someone said they didn't understand fantasy series because ""magic had no rules."" (That's entirely false; every magic system has rules. The rules may just not always be defined to the reader in a concrete way. Some may also just have a much softer set of rules than other systems.)"
"Even though I only eat my safe foods, my safe foods aren’t always safe.. there are moments im really hungry but litteraly NOTHING sounds good and thinking about even my safe foods make me wanna barf all over the room. so I starve myself"
"I agree, with one very specific caveat. If I’m eating Buffalo wings with blue cheese/ranch, or have two sauces for any reason, the sauces can’t mix. I will spoon blue cheese onto the wing rather than dip it. Please don’t ask me to explain, because I can’t."
Same!
"I am notorious for mixing foods and doing it in bizarre ways. For example, one of my comfort meals is lima beans with shredded mozzarella cheese and canned tuna."
"Same. I’m avoidant of beef, bell peppers, onions, “basic” things. But I love all kinds of other stuff. When I was in kindergarten I wrote that my favorite food was calamari and had to explain that it was fried squid.😹 (and according to my teacher I spelled it all on my own pfft)"
"OKAY thank you. I have to ask, have you had the trolli gummy eggs. They’re gooey and chewy on the inside and grainy candy coating on the outside. It’s hard to find them but whenever I do I immediately eat an entire bag"
Right ?? It gives me hella imposter syndrome too bc it’s such a common trait
Definitely don’t relate
ME TOO the idea of like those 3 star 12 course meals sounds so exciting to me but I could  never afford it
"Oh I agree entirely, spicy food is absolutely everything to me !! Most of my safe foods are korean because it’s primarily what I grew up on (and also seems to be the most consistent no matter where i go in the world)"
"I’m the same !!! I loveee cooking (hate the dishes part so my partner does that for me) but my best friend has ARFID and it is absolutely awful for her, she can only eat like 6 things, so I feel for your kiddos :("
Oh sauce 100% food group. I have drank sauce before
Omg the cold salad next to hot food would drive me insane. Like Put it in a separate bowl PLEASE you’ll ruin the crispness of my lettuce !! Completely understand
Yep that is exactly what my mom did for me !! I’m very thankful for it
You don't eat casserole then? Like chicken broccoli noodles and sauce all cooked together in the oven or anything like that? Lasagna? Or if it's all cooked together then it's fine but if they're cooked separately then they stay separate?
Me too !! My one single no no food is pickled green beans. I love the taste but they squeak on my teeth when I chew them and it makes me want to behead myself
"So much. Then there's the ""funny"" videos. I can't understand why people, including NT's, find it funny to see a video of an animal or person falling down. Then there's pranks which are infuriating to see people inflicted with."
"I relate to this hugely!!! I had to distance myself from my parents, but my mum has cancer and it's really hard, I want to be there but so hard. I cry sometimes when someone tells me something sad, they are often not crying."
"I think I'm often masking and so worried about hurting people that I don't allow myself much, it causes a lot of anxiety, I can get very angry also"
"yeah i'm high in cognitive but low in affective

like, so low that i wondered before if i'm a sociopath; told my wife that when i hear about bad things happenign to people, and she's crying bc she has high affective empathy, that my only thought is basically ""glad it wasn't me""

it's very hard for me to respond to people empathetically like ""i'm sorry for your loss"" and stuff because it feels like a lie, and i *hate* lying. Like I get it sucks for them and understand it, but I don't feel any empathy at all. It's completely missing."
">I kinda wonder if instead of being ""low empathy"", it's more of ""difficulty expressing empathy"".

They confuse ""having empathy"" with performing a facial expression. Which shows their total and complete lack of empathy."
"AFAIK what the diagnostic is referring to is low *cognitive* empathy, but many people interpret that to refer to *somatic* empathy as well. The latter of the two actually tends to be higher in autistic folks, hence the dislike for funny videos of people getting hurt."
it is actually. they say autistic people have low empathy but in fact we have higher empathy(in most cases) but we don’t express our empathy in a “normal way” so it’s disregarded
"That's very much *it* in my case. During times when the one I love is upset emotionally, I cannot offer comfort; I don't know how to."
"I've heard that one of the unofficial autism symptoms is too much empathy. So apparently its like one or the complete opposite. Seems weird to me, though."
I find talking about and expressing my feelings difficult in general
"i think thats it, because imo we feel more empathy than allistic people, it just looks different."
"I'm not sure actually, but I feel like I am personally somewhere in between. I actually didn't talk about it during my diagnosis, maybe I should've asked about it.

When I'm around people and they talk about their problems, or something happened, I usually feel nothing at all and I don't know what to say or what to do.

But when I'm by myself on the computer, and I read about something or I'm watching a TV series or movie, I can get super emotional to the point where it almost breaks me for a while. 

But I feel like that only happens when it's regarding something that I've grown attached to. A fictional character that I just like especially much, a scenario in which something happened in a certain way which just resonated with me especially strongly. So it's very situational. 

For example, the animated series ""Arcane"". I really liked the characters, especially Powder (Jinx) that resonated with me strongly, and that series made me an emotional wreck for weeks. (Would recommend this series to everyone btw).

Another example: When Christina Grimmie died. I liked some of her covers, but I was not really a fan or anything. When I see news on reddit if there's a singer or actor that passed, even someone I know of, I usually don't feel very strongly about it. But I read that she had tweeted about the event where she was killed, asking everyone to come and just seemed so happy about it. Then if I remember correctly, it said in the news that Christina reached out her arms to hug the person (during the fan-meet/autograph signing) who then pulled out a gun and shot her.

And it was just something about that situation that made me feel so strongly about her death. I don't know if that is hyper empathy, or even if it's empathic, or if it's something else. But it certainly feels hyperemotional.

Maybe someone has similar experiences, or maybe it's normal among NT's as well?"
Yes it was thought to be the case in the past but luckily things changed!!
Yep I know what this can be like
"Me too. In college, I saw a horrible documentary that made me feel so much distress over the subjects’ suffering that it threw me into a combo of depression and panic disorder that lasted over two years."
Same here
"All your points are valid, but not all autistic people have high empathy! (I personally have low somatic empathy :) )"
">making the conversation about ourselves” but we’re actually sharing similar experiences so we can let them know we understand what they’re going through completely

Yes but only if after you revert back to *their issue*  and this rarely if ever happens."
"I relate to this, trying to micro manage conversation, I'm hyper vigilant in conversation"
"Does that mean autistic with ADHD? Because I don’t have ADHD. My brain chose the single rather than the remix EP, if you will. That was a terrible analogy, I’ll see myself out. *Leaves quietly.*"
"this get me thinking, i am only diagnostic as autistic, and i've been told that when i was point out as ADHD when i was younger it was a mistake, and i am actually only autistc, but there is so MUCH things that i identify as ADHD, i've seem experiences of people that are autistic and have adhd an i identify SO much more then with people there is just autistic, i've been thinking to talk about it with my therapist, we've been talk so much other things that is happened in my life that i always forget lol"
I relate to this tbh. I’m asd and adhd
"You sounds fun, actually. I love enthusiasm."
Ugh god this is me.
I've seriously had a barman get quite aggressive with me because I can't possibly have grew up where I claimed and sound like I do so I'm definitely lying.
"For years I could hear those high pitched dog whistles, sirens from a mile away and know where they were, alarms etc. I only knew because it literally hurt my fucking ears [felt like an ice pick being driven into my ears, or like having an ear infection]. As a result I’m going deaf and I’m in my 30‘s, I now can’t hear any of it, the irony. 

Same same with spices, chillies regardless of the strength hurt my mouth, clothes rubbing me kinda feels like sunburn. 

Conversely, I can chop the top of my finger off with a chainsaw [gardening incident] and happily wander around and sit quietly. All I said to my husband was „Husband, I think I’ve hurt myself pretty bad, but I can’t tell, it’s bleeding loads.“ **husband looks and starts flapping around like the house is on fire**"
"Autistic migraineur here! Yeah we're being literal, it HURTS. When I hear a sudden loud noise, I literally feel like someone has stabbed my eardrums with an ice pick. I would rather stub my toe."
"I know this comes from privilege in terms of access to language and education but I like the neuroscience term “noxious stimuli”. It’s used for lots of situations describing animal behavior but usually means intolerable. Or I describe it as “like fingernails on a chalkboard” because at least the spine chilling experience I have with that is very similar to when I encounter other sensory stimuli that are noxious — like touchy cotton balls, hearing styrofoam etc"
"For what it's worth, I have some sensory issues where the sensory input causes me physical pain in a weird way. It's not the same as soreness or a bruise or a cut or even a headache, but the only terminology that accurately describes it is ""pain"" or ""hurt"". Sunlight is one of these, and I avoid going out during the day and take vitamin D supplements as a result.

I *also* deal with other sensory issues in which it is distressing and comfortable but isn't painful. There are a lot of them. 

Both are issues, both are related to sensory problems. But, they aren't the same! Just thought you might appreciate that input."
"I have chronic pain and very high tolerance pain as well. However, soft touch or tickles are painful. Emotional things are mostly just distressing as well for me and can get close to painful when PMSing."
"I have learned that I ""escape into the cognitive"" and shut out my body. Ie Alexathymia. I believe it's from longterm mild trauma from sensory stuff that I can't escape. I ended up with very severe chronic pain and i believe that's because i just kinda ""stored"" pain instead of feeling it.As I've done practices around accessing and feeling my sensations and emotions better , I am noticing that sensory stuff that was previously only ""bothering"" or unpleasant, is, indeed , actually painful.

It's been weird and I've wondered if im imagining it. But you know what- my chronic pain is lessening. Pretty dramatically actually- and this is pain that everybody said was essentially untreatable/only ""manageable"".

So for whatever that's worth...😳"
"I have a high pain tolerance too. Did boxing and Muay Thai. Have tattoos. But I have chronic pain from medical stuff. Also, sounds do hurt me. It's weird. I make no sense as a human."
Same. It makes it hard for me to describe both my chronic pain and my feelings.
"Same. The closest I ever understood the pain of sensory issues would be to extreme light/brightness, or sounds, because I can actually perceive the pain on my retinas/in my eardrum. I don't really have the painful touch sensory issue"
"Hm, I wonder if this is due to some random genetic mutation that decided that auditory input should cause pain signals for some people..........that would explain it.

Some random genetic mutation in me decided I should be more sensitive to touch........"
"Yes mine take a physical toll as well, multiple conversations around me are the worst. That's a horrible feeling, my brain goes haywire and something messed up happens in my head."
"Yes, we seem to take a lot of things literally and when people say stuff hurts, but I dont register it as pain, more like distress in varying levels, I can then look and think 'no that's not me'.

But actually is, either people are struggling to describe it, maybe some people actually light feel pain, or we cannot read between the lines and realise we're talking about the same thing.

It's difficult sometimes."
"I have plenty that bother me, but I dont think 'pain' is an accurate descriptor though."
"See I have the bright light trigger really bad and I also have sound with high pitch sounds which are instant triggers.

Then I have triggers that build up like tapping sounds for example.

I think its just brain saying cover your ears because that's the source or your eyes because that's where the light is getting in, and it is immensely distressing, almost painful, but its not the same as a headache, or my back pain, or my knees / shoulder.

Things like you describe is where I think 'pain' as a descriptor is where some miss understanding comes from.

I have had some truly extremely painful experiences (physical pain, broken bones, muscle tears, surgery, pushed in front of a moving taxi etc) and I just don't think it's the same thing personally.

Though I understand how hard it is to put into words though and respect other people's views of course."
"Completely agree, there's just no ignoring them, it must stop or I must leave. 

I know its a me thing so it's something I can use earphones to stop or I gotta go dude !"
"Thats different, I've never heard of itchy teeth before. And is it like one of those itches you can't get to? I have a weird type of itch sometimes and it happens in one of my shoulder blades sometimes but I cant scratch the itch, it's like it's inside me rather than the skin surface and it drives me nuts !"
"Yes bright lights in the eye are definitely pretty close to being 'painful', that causes me much distress and instant flight mode response."
"The fact check is very interesting, because if anything is close to legitimate pain its high pitch alarms, also bright light.

Physical pain will cause flight mode I guess, you'll move away from things causing physical pain typically, and maybe that's where sensory triggers cross over because of the fight or flight mode thing."
"Yes I agree with being over whelmed by it, multiple conversations in my space or flashing lights are probably my biggest instantly 'I gotta go right now' provoker"
"100% it has an effect on me, I must leave the environment causing it somehow, mine are a constant a work really and it takes it toll.

It's 3.19pm were I am and I'm still on bed resting my brain."
for years i did this thing where i looked back and forth between eyes. only recently was i told that people don’t really do that 😭
i’m with you on that!
personally i would consider that struggling. that’s what i experience with strangers.
Me too please
The book is called Different Not Less by Chloe Hayden!
My bad. I didn’t really know the difference
"I do both but I’m more likely to go non verbal than hyper verbal. However, I also have C-PTSD and schizophrenia so those could also be huge factors in my selective mutism."
Love mine too. But when the beads start to pool because the pockets bleed into to the other and the blanket is uneven. Becomes unusable and have to pay the $$$ for a new one. This last one is on two years now :-). Last one was less than a year. How long do they usually last for all of you?
I got a kids sized one so my feet aren't touched by it.
"Yeah, I think there's been a big boom of adults finally getting diagnosed and looking back and going ""oh"" and quite a few of them probably went diagnosed due to (perceived) doing well in school and kind of ""going under the radar"""
LMAO you might be onto something
Ye?
"Everyone and their mama claims to be the “gifted kid burnout neurodivergent” and I definitely feel out of place online and feel I am often spoken over, even if it’s not common outside of online spaces."
Is that a scary experience?
"Selective mutism is an anxiety disorder with it’s own set of symptoms, the two can be comorbid but if the episodes of mutism were part of autism or any other condition then SM shouldn’t be diagnosed."
"Every Human can suddently go nonverbal. For NTs is mostly that cant find the right word or they feel anxious.

Im one of those ""suddently cant go nonverbal"" People. I cant say why it happens or what triggers i."
Very interesting.
"I'm a lot like this, and because I'm usually hyperverbal if anything and even eloquent, people assume I can always advocate for myself. But when I get overwhelmed I can't speak."
Noted.
Got it. Thank you for letting me know.
I’m sorry. That sounds awful.
"Oddly, I'm extremely social, just more one on one interactions, I have a hard time navigating past two other people and just prefer not to be outnumbered 🤣😭 It's more it doesn't occur to me to do it. Sometimes I realize after the fact that I was expected to change my behavior for that social situation but like, it's extremely rare to nil,  that it happens in the moment."
"People think it’s strange how much I love b29’s (specifically because of the history). But I think it’s the most beautiful machine ever built and talk about them regularly to anyone who will listen. One day I will have a huge poster so I can sit and bask in its magnificence. 

Spitfires also are acceptable."
"I actually do find vacations stressful (when I’m not in charge lol) due to the expectations and *constant* changes without warning. So I do need to recover from that. But the staying at other houses, in other rooms, etc I definitely relate to…but it also stresses me out sometimes.

I do have comorbid ADHD, so a lot of it is the two disorders fighting relentlessly in my head."
"> What I actually need is for the plans I do make to not get changed last minute

This! Yes! Exactly!!"
"I feel like I never hear people talk about issues with temperature or wetness!! Like I HATE being cold and wet, WORST sensation. I also have a BIG issue with focused air, like fans and stuff. I cannot stand direct contact with a fan unless I am melting in the heat, which takes a very long time for me since I'm more comfortable in the heat"
"pros: you don't need to unnecessary nice

cons: if you need to make eye contact - they'll have murderous eyes standard face on"
SO TRUE
"Apparently because autism tends to come with a level of amount of extra mobility in the joints (regardless of whether this extends to full hypermobility), gravity on our arms can be quite uncomfortable as it puts pressure on the shoulder joint. Dinosaur arms activate the bicep which counteracts that feeling of your shoulder being pulled. I found this to be a really interesting theory since dinosaurs arms is one of those things I did long before I knew it was ‘an autism thing’ so that would suggest an underlying cause and this would explain that perfectly - it even works with the fact I stopped doing it when my shoulder muscles got some action."
"A meltdown is when you feel overwhelmed and you lose control of yourself, so you start crying, screaming, kicking the ground, throwing things or even hitting yourself in the legs or the face. You don't have to do all of that at once, long time ago I cried uncontrollably in class and I started swaying while people tried to talk to me and to touch me without receiving an answer and, today, I recognize it as a meltdown. A shutdown is when, usually after experiencing a bad situation, you go non-verbal for some minutes/hours or even for some days/weeks."
"I don't often gain a new hyperfixation, but when I do... it'll take over my brain for years... /ref"
^(prolonged eye contact)
PFFT
"Thanks for the information. I’m constantly learning more about autism all the time and I appreciate you helping me do so. And no, I think it’s awesome that you like hot sauce that much. What kind of hot sauce is your favorite?"
What are shutdowns? I was under the impression they were the same thing
"If you mean like internally I get really upset then yeah I still do that but I just sit for a minute and I’m good, still upset but ready to continue my day"
